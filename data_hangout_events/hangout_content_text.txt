 Quest DescriptionOne day, you walk into the Sumeru Akademiya...

(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Layla, optional)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915001 layla 01.ogg Layla: (Maybe I should just go back...)
(If the player has not met Layla yet‍[verification needed])

Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 01.ogg ???: Huh...?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 02.ogg ???: What is it? Is there something on my face...?
 Are you a student here?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 03.ogg ???: *sigh* I may not be for long.
 Are you lost?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 04.ogg ???: In a way, I suppose I am... I have no idea what to do about my thesis.
 You're not a thief, are you?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 05.ogg ???: H—Hey, not so loud...!
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 06.ogg ???: Ah no, that makes me sound suspicious... Hold on, do I really look that shady?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 07.ogg Layla: Anyway, I'm Layla, a Rtawahist student at the Akademiya... for now, at least. I was just looking up some information at the House of Daena...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 08.ogg Layla: But the more I read, the more I realized that my thesis lacks integrity. I didn't cover many of the possible outliers, and my calculations aren't precise enough.
(Stress Value +1)
(If the player has already met Layla)

Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 09.ogg Layla: *sigh* Oh, we meet again.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 10.ogg Layla: Sorry, but I don't really have time to chat right now.
 You seem a little tired.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 11.ogg Layla: Yeah, it's been days since I've had a good night's sleep.
 Are you going to go visit Twirly-Whirly?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 12.ogg Layla: Oh, come to think of it, I haven't seen Twirly-Whirly in a long time...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 13.ogg Layla: Ah, but no, now's not the time for that.
 What's wrong?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 14.ogg Layla: I was originally looking up some information at the House of Daena, but the more I read, the more I realized that my thesis is horribly lacking.
(Stress Value +1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 15.ogg Layla: I should've been done with the first draft of my thesis by now, but I've barely written a third... *whimper*
 Okay, so what are you planning to do now?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 16.ogg Layla: Well... *sigh* I guess I have to keep looking up as much info as possible. I shouldn't give up now.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 17.ogg Layla: But who am I kidding... Maybe I'm not cut out to be a researcher. Maybe I shouldn't have come to the Akademiya in the first place. All I've done is cause trouble for my adviser and classmates.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 18.ogg Layla: I should probably notify my adviser sooner than later, so he can focus his attention on the other students... Ah no, I don't even have the guts to bring it up, and I haven't completely given up yet.
 Cheer up. Things probably aren't as bad as you think they are.
 You still have time, right?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 19.ogg Layla: To be honest, I haven't slept a wink for days... Just thinking about the awful state of my thesis keeps me up at night.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 20.ogg Layla: Lack of sleep hinders my ability to focus, and if I can't focus, I can't do any proper research or thinking. I'm stuck in a vicious cycle.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 21.ogg Layla: I've seen the caliber of the other Akademiya students, they're all geniuses and fast learners. I'm nowhere near as gifted as they are...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 22.ogg Layla: If it wasn't for someone who's been helping me out, my adviser probably would have kicked me out of the Darshan by now.
 Are they a sage?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 24.ogg Layla: If that was the case, I would've already left on my own... Just the idea of being watched by a sage is terrifying.
 Are they the Great Fungus Elder?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 25.ogg Layla: Huh, what's that? A fungus with a long beard? There's no such thing... though if there were, I'd love to give it a pat or two.
 Is this "someone" a good friend of yours?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 23.ogg Layla: *sigh* No, all my friends are back home. I'm the only one who got to come study at the Akademiya.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 26.ogg Layla: This might sound strange, but I actually don't know who's been helping me. I don't even know if they're a person or not.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 27.ogg Layla: Due to my lack of sleep, I sometimes get dizzy and faint when I'm stressed out...
 It's that bad, huh?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 28.ogg Layla: Yeah... But oddly enough, when I wake up, all the things I was stressing over are taken care of.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 29.ogg Layla: My homework's somehow finished before the deadline, and my papers are perfectly written.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 30.ogg Layla: But that's not all... my flowers are watered, laundry's done, even my broken Kamera was fixed...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 31.ogg Layla: I really don't know what's going on, but for now, I'm calling the phenomenon a "blessing from the stars."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 32.ogg Layla: Maybe the stars above decided to help out after seeing all the effort I put into my research... Haha, if that's even possible...
 That sounds pretty extraordinary.
 I want powers like that.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 33.ogg Layla: *sigh* But, there's no point in me studying at the Akademiya if I keep relying on this mysterious phenomenon...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 34.ogg Layla: It comes down to my own efforts, improving one step at a time... How else can I honor my parents and live up to the expectations of everyone who knows me.
 That makes sense. The effort you put in is equally important.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 35.ogg Layla: Oh no, I've already spent too much time chatting...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 36.ogg Layla: *sigh* I still haven't made much headway on my thesis. At this rate, I'll need the Wisdom Seelie's help.
 You just said you wanted to rely on your own efforts...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 37.ogg Layla: Yes, but time's of the essence, so I have to take what I can get... Sorry, I'm just making excuses...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 38.ogg Layla: But the Wisdom Seelie is truly amazing and freely shares its endless knowledge.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 39.ogg Layla: If you want its help, all you have to do is write down your question, and you'll get a response a short while later.
 Can Seelies even do something like that?
 Maybe it's some researcher who wants to remain anonymous?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 40.ogg Layla: No one knows who or what it actually is... It's just known as the Wisdom Seelie.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 41.ogg Layla: But getting an answer all comes down to the Seelie's mood. Sometimes it'll only give you a vague answer or play tricks on you. I'm pretty sure a researcher wouldn't do something like that...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 42.ogg Layla: All I can do right now is hope that it helps me...
 But what about the blessing from the stars?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 43.ogg Layla: Who knows if it'll happen this time... I can't put all my eggs in one basket.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 44.ogg Layla: Trying my luck with another phenomenon is better than doing nothing.
 It sounds a little sketchy, but I'll go check it out with you. (This dialogue option leads to The Wisdom Seelie.)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 45.ogg Layla: Oh, really? But I don't want to take up your time...
 It's fine, I don't have anything going on.
 I'm worried that you'll pass out from exhaustion soon.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 46.ogg Layla: Sorry for the bother. You're too kind.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 47.ogg Layla: Okay, let's go give it a try. I've already prepared my question for the Seelie.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 48.ogg Layla: I just hope it can help me get through this predicament.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 49.ogg Layla: Among the countless legends surrounding the House of Daena, the Wisdom Seelie is one of the more popular ones lately...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 50.ogg Layla: It hasn't been around for long, but word of the Seelie's existence spread like wildfire. Many people have claimed that they've received a reply from it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 51.ogg Layla: So it should probably help me as well, right?
 So do you just call its name and it appears?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 52.ogg Layla: I don't know its name, and we have to keep our voices down in the House of Daena, or else you'll get some scary glares from the Mahamata.
 Or is there some kind of summoning ritual?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 53.ogg Layla: Any funny antics in the House of Daena will get you escorted out... or perhaps thrown out.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 54.ogg Layla: Let's split up and ask around about the Seelie. Hopefully someone knows something more.
(Proceed to The Wisdom Seelie)
 It's too risky to rely on some fishy legend to complete your thesis. (This dialogue option leads to A Change of Pace.)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 55.ogg Layla: Mmm... You're right. I need to keep a level head — I don't have time to waste.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 56.ogg Layla: But what do we do from here...? I can't just go back and start packing to leave.
 You should rest first.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 57.ogg Layla: Rest...? But my deadline's just around the corner. I don't think I can afford to rest right now...
 You won't be able to write anything in your current state.
 You'll waste even more time if you try to push yourself like this.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 58.ogg Layla: ...You do have a point. Sorry, I tend to panic easily... as you can see.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 59.ogg Layla: Then how should I rest? I definitely won't be able to sleep... As soon as I close my eyes, all kinds of thoughts start floating into my head.
 How about we head to Puspa Café?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915002 layla 60.ogg Layla: Oh, that's a good idea. A cup of coffee might help clear my head. Let's go.
(Proceed to A Change of Pace)

An Exasperating Prank[]
 Quest DescriptionYou know that it might not be fruitful even if you pursue it to the end, so you decide to forget about the Wisdom Seelie's prank and watch over Layla as she rests.

Media:vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 01.ogg Layla: Let's stop here... I don't think I can walk any further...
 I'll prepare some food and juice.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 02.ogg Layla: Alright, I'm gonna give my legs a rest. I'll be waiting for you here.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 03.ogg Layla: I feel bad for making you go through so much trouble for me. If only I were more capable...
 No, you shouldn't say that.
 We're all skilled at different things.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 04.ogg Layla: I'm sorry... *sigh* I always find myself having to apologize.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 05.ogg Layla: But enough of that, I need to pull myself together. The memories I've been reminded of are all really taxing.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 06.ogg Layla: I cannot just give up this time, even if my head's not in a good place. Letting these heavy feelings get the best of me will only slow us down.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 07.ogg Layla: Ahh, watch out! Behind you!
 What's wrong?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 08.ogg Layla: Monsters! A lot of them, too... Why didn't we see them coming?
 Just leave it to me, it'll only take a moment.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 09.ogg Layla: No, I'll fight, too.
 You need to rest.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 10.ogg Layla: But I want to help, I can't just sit back and watch you while you fight. Don't worry, I can handle myself.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 11.ogg Layla: I mustn't keep repeating my past regrets. That's the most valuable lesson I've learned today.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 12.ogg Layla: I should take action when I'm needed and give it my all when the moment calls.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 13.ogg Layla: If you miss those opportunities in life, you may never get another chance to make up for them. I suppose that's fate.
 I see.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 14.ogg Layla: Alright, let's take them all down.
(Defeat the attacking monsters)
(Talk to Layla)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 01.ogg Layla: *panting* ...I really need to keep up with my training.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 02.ogg Layla: It's embarrassing to be out of breath so quickly like this...
 Are you alright?
 You look pale.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 03.ogg Layla: Well, the only appropriate response would be to say that I'm fine, right? I'm pale due to lack of sleep, not because of the fight...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 04.ogg Layla: But then again, I know you'd be able to see right through those words... I'm feeling weak, there's no hiding it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 05.ogg Layla: I'm just happy I didn't get in your way during the fight...
 You did great.
(Stress Value −1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 06.ogg Layla: Oh, hehe... thanks for the compliment. I sure don't get to hear that often.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 07.ogg Layla: Although I may not be physically strong, my will is as resilient as they come. I'll be fine after I rest for a bit.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 08.ogg Layla: Can you stay with me while I recover my energy? It shouldn't take long.

Ending: Once Bitten, Twice Shy[]


Once Bitten, Twice Shy


Aether
Lumine







Despite her incredibly weak disposition, she still chose to make a stand. Perhaps she wanted to prove a point, or perhaps she didn't want to leave regrets...

Yun-Han Opera Troupe in Crisis[]
 Quest DescriptionYunning of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe is currently outside Liyue branch of the Adventurers' Guild, fretting over someone's disappearance.

(Go to Liyue Adventurers' Guild)
Media:vo yjcop001 1901707 yunning 01.ogg Yunning: Can't you send someone any sooner? The clock is ticking and I need this resolved ASAP!
Media:vo yjcop001 1901707 katheryne 01.ogg Katheryne: I'm sorry, but we don't have any adventurers available at this instant...
 What's happened?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901707 katheryne 02.ogg Katheryne: Ah, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), your timing is most optimal. Allow me to introduce Yunning, manager of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe. She has commissioned the Guild to—
Media:vo yjcop001 1901707 yunning 02.ogg Yunning: ...(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? Ah, Yun Jin is always talking about you. Please, you've gotta help us find her!
 Yun Jin is missing?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901707 yunning 03.ogg Yunning: Yep, she's gone and disappeared. Now, of all times, just days away from the big performance. All she left was this short note...
Beautifully-Written Note:
To Whomsoever Finds This Letter:
 
After some discussion about the "Divine Maiden" play with my friends, I find that there is still much to learn indeed. I have gone to Lingju Pass in hopes of gaining some inspiration.
I will return within the day, so do not worry.
 
Yun Jin
Media:vo yjcop001 1901707 yunning 04.ogg Yunning: If our audience doesn't get to see Yun Jin on stage, they'll start tearing the place down... I mean, what am I supposed to do, huh?
 She literally said she would come back...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901707 katheryne 03.ogg Katheryne: That's what I said, too, but—
Media:vo yjcop001 1901707 yunning 05.ogg Yunning: Look, when you're a megastar like Yun Jin, you gotta start taking things a little more seriously. Saying she'll be back doesn't give me a whole lot of reassurance when she's showing no regard for her own safety.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901707 yunning 06.ogg Yunning: Why does she have to go and practice somewhere so dangerous? What if something happens to her? What am I going to tell the audience!?
 Worst-case scenario, she still has a Vision...
 I'm pretty sure her life is not at risk here.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901707 yunning 07.ogg Yunning: Well then... what if she gets into a scrape and hurts herself? If she gets so much as a scratch, it'll be a loss to the whole nation!
Media:vo yjcop001 1901707 katheryne 04.ogg Katheryne: *sigh*... As you can see, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), this is what we're up against.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901707 katheryne 05.ogg Katheryne: Would you be willing to accept this commission?
 Okay. For Yun Jin...
 Okay. For Liyue...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901707 yunning 08.ogg Yunning: Wonderful! Oh, thank the stars... Please, you've gotta bring her back, safe and sound!
(Talk to Yunning again)
Media:vo yjcop001 1901750 yunning 01.ogg Yunning: I'm counting on you to bring my top talent back to where she needs to be.

(Head to Lingju Pass to look for Yun Jin)
Media:vo yjcop001 1901701 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: ...
 Monster attack!!!
 Get out of the way!
Media:vo yjcop001 1901701 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: ...
 (...I guess I'm taking this fight!)

(After the battle)
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: ...
 Are you alright?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: Mmm...
 Are you hurt?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: ...Oh.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: It's you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: I do apologize, I didn't see you there.
 ...Seriously!?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: What brings you all the way up here, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? Oddly enough, I was just thinking of scheduling a meeting with you later...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: I didn't expect to run into you here, of all places.
 Your manager sent me.
 I heard you went missing...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 08.ogg Yun Jin: Ah, I see. So Yunning sent you... I did tell her not to worry...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 09.ogg Yun Jin: Phew, but... on this occasion, it seems I'm rather lucky you came. You've helped me avert a major catastrophe.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 10.ogg Yun Jin: It's a pity, though... I was so close to achieving the state of mind that Shenhe was talking about...
 What state of mind?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 11.ogg Yun Jin: Do you remember what Shenhe said about the "divine damsel" fighting against the evil monster? That in reality, she hadn't acted as courageously as the operatic rendition would have you believe... That it was simply a matter of life and death, and she chose self-preservation?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 12.ogg Yun Jin: Granted, she later admitted that she preferred the version of events given in the opera, with its portrayal of a divine heroine sacrificing herself for others...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 13.ogg Yun Jin: But after giving it a lot of consideration, I think that this character is defined by her emotional complexity and even uncertainty. So the more emotions I can experience for myself, the wider range I will have to draw on in my performance.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 14.ogg Yun Jin: If access to a different state of mind can help me provide a fresh interpretation of the character and her actions... well, surely it will take my acting skills to the next level!
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 15.ogg Yun Jin: That's why I came here.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 16.ogg Yun Jin: My plan was to take it slowly, start by just dipping my toe in, as it were, but once I started... I just got completely drawn in...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 17.ogg Yun Jin: Ah, I feel like I was so close to a breakthrough here...
 This is much too dangerous!
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 18.ogg Yun Jin: Considering the rewards that I could reap from this experience, the risk is negligible.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 19.ogg Yun Jin: Still, if I choose to continue, this is unlikely to be the last time I'd need your help...
 ...Want to try again? I'll join in, too.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 20.ogg Yun Jin: You've defeated an ancient god before. How am I supposed to experience genuine danger if you're here with me?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 21.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm... I suppose I had better return to Liyue Harbor for now. I'll only end up putting you in an awkward position otherwise. Goodness knows how you'd explain this to Yunning.
 Very true...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901702 yunjin 22.ogg Yun Jin: I wonder whether I have gained anything useful from this trip... Hmm, I suppose only time will tell.

Crisis Averted[]

(Return to the Liyue Adventurers' Guild)
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 01.ogg Yunning: Can you put a few more adventurers on the case, or something? The clock's still ticking away...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 katheryne 01a.ogg Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 katheryne 01b.ogg Katheryne: Please have faith in (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)... Ah, they've returned.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Yunning, we're back.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 02.ogg Yunning: Yun Jin! Are you okay? Are you hurt? Do you need to go to Bubu Pharmacy?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: *sigh* No, I'm fine. You don't need to worry. When it's time to go on stage, I'll be there.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 03.ogg Yunning: *sigh* Look, I get it — you like to go out exploring. That's fine. But do you really have to go off thrill-seeking this close to the show?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 04.ogg Yunning: You have to take better care of yourself, okay? For all our sakes. For the opera troupe and for your audience.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 05.ogg Yunning: We're just lucky we had (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) to help out. What if something had happened to you, huh? What would I say to our audience, hmm?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: Well... I would say that the best way to make it up to our audience is to give them the best performance we can. Don't you agree?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: While I'm offstage, as long as there is something, anything I can do to improve my acting ability, even the slightest amount, I can't pass up the opportunity.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 06.ogg Yunning: You know, you... you... ugh, I don't know what to say anymore. (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! Please! You tell her!
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: So... what's your honest opinion, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 Ultimately, safety should come first...
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 You made a good point, Yun Jin...
(Proceed to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 Ultimately, safety should come first...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 07.ogg Yunning: Exactly, exactly. Just think of all the people coming from far and wide just to show you their support.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: Why do you make it sound like... they are coming to see me, and not the show?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 08.ogg Yunning: Well, same difference, isn't it?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm... I don't think so. They seem quite different to me.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 08.ogg Yun Jin: Well, either way, you're quite right. I mustn't let down our audience, especially those who came from afar.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 09.ogg Yun Jin: ...And I certainly mustn't make you come out looking for me again, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 10.ogg Yun Jin: So I suppose I will put my training exercises on hold for a while.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 09.ogg Yunning: Wheeeew. I'm glad to know that the brightest star in my troupe is finally going to start listening to reason.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 10.ogg Yunning: I'm gonna head back and see how the set is coming along. Don't go disappearing on me again.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 11.ogg Yun Jin: *sigh*... Alright, I'll head back and do some rehearsing.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 12.ogg Yun Jin: It's no substitute for firsthand experience, but it should still help me iron out a few issues.
 It's also much safer than firsthand experience...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 13.ogg Yun Jin: Heh. Speaking of which, I haven't even thanked you properly for saving me.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 14.ogg Yun Jin: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), if you are free after the show, come and find me at Tea House.[Note 1]
(Proceed to After the Curtain Falls)

Branch 2[]

 You made a good point, Yun Jin...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 15.ogg Yun Jin: I'm glad you agree! Right, then let's get preparing...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 11.ogg Yunning: Hey... hey! (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), get over here!
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 12.ogg Yunning: You've only just managed to bring Yun Jin back — now you're taking her straight back out again? What's the big idea?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 13.ogg Yunning: The next show is just days away. Please, if not for me, then for the sake of the opera troupe — I'm begging you. Help me convince her that at the end of the day, she's gotta fall in line.
 That is not going to be an easy task...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 14.ogg Yunning: *sigh* Well, okay, maybe that's asking the impossible — but at least try and keep her distracted.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 15.ogg Yunning: Please. Just keep her occupied until the next show. No more thrill-seeking!
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 16.ogg Yun Jin: What're you two talking about? If it doesn't involve me, I think I'm going to—
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 16.ogg Yunning: Eh, eh, eh! Uh... y'know what, it does involve you, actually! The Traveler was saying, uh, that...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 17.ogg Yunning: Come on! Help me stall her!
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 17.ogg Yun Jin: Oh?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 18.ogg Yun Jin: Well, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? What do you need from me?
 I... want to become an actor!
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 19.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm? You want to... become an actor?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 18a.ogg Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 18b.ogg Yunning: Uh... y—you do? Ahem! Yes, of course (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍) does! (‍HeHeText for male Traveler/SheSheText for female Traveler‍) was just telling me that (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍)'s interested in exploring (‍hishisText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) dramatic side and, uh, would like you to give (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) some coaching!
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 19.ogg Yunning: Right, good, well, let's not beat around the bush! Traveler, your master awaits...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 20.ogg Yun Jin: H—Hold on... I don't know if I'm really ready to take on students yet...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 20a.ogg Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 20b.ogg Yunning: Tsk, please! This is the day you've dreamed of, isn't it? You certainly talk about it enough! And look, now (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍)'s here, ready and willing...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 21.ogg Yun Jin: Ahem! Okay, okay, I get it, you can stop now!
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 22.ogg Yun Jin: Phew... (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), I am delighted that you wish to study the performing arts from me.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 23.ogg Yun Jin: But the issue is, before you could become my apprentice, I'd have to get approval from the founders, then do an initiation ceremony... There just isn't time for all that right now.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 24.ogg Yun Jin: So for now, I'll just teach you a few basics. Informally, one friend to another. There's no need to call me "master."
 What about "teacher"?
 What about "coach"?
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 25.ogg Yun Jin: Um, wh—what? Don't you think that's a bit old-fashioned? Let's work on that later...
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 26.ogg Yun Jin: Until we settle on an appropriate title... just call me by my name.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 27.ogg Yun Jin: Let's meet tomorrow morning on the bridge by the sea at Feiyun Slope.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunjin 28.ogg Yun Jin: I'll do my best to prepare a good first lesson for you.
Media:vo yjcop001 1901703 yunning 21.ogg Yunning: Phew. What a relief...

Guili Plains Treasure Hunt[]

Media:vo_bdcop001_1905306_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: It should be around here, right?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905306_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: Hmm? Who are they...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905306_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: Oh, it's a bunch of Treasure Hoarders... I guess the treasure's for real, then.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905306_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), there are quite a few of them. If things go south and fists start flying, stay behind me.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905306_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: I'm more than a match for these amateurs.
(Stop the Treasure Hoarders who are currently digging)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_01.ogg Golden Alligator: Keep digging, boys! Once we have our hands on the treasure, everyone gets a share!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: You can all hold it right there!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_02.ogg Golden Alligator: Huh!? Who's that barking orders?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_03.ogg Golden Alligator: Do you know who you're up against here? Keep going if you've got a death wish...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_04.ogg Golden Alligator: What the...!? It's, it's...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_05.ogg Golden Alligator: C—C—Captain... B—B—B—Beidou!!!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_06.ogg Golden Alligator: Run, boys! Run!!!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: Nobody move!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_07.ogg Golden Alligator: ...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_08.ogg Golden Alligator: Captain Beidou! Lord of the Ocean! This is all my fault, I didn't know who I was up against, I—I don't have a death wish, I swear...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_09.ogg Golden Alligator: I got a big mouth is all... It's always saying things it shouldn't. I swear I'll wash it out with soap the moment I get back...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_10.ogg Golden Alligator: Please, have mercy. Will you spare us?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: Hmph!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_11.ogg Golden Alligator: ...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_12.ogg Golden Alligator: W—Well, spare them, at least... These guys are just trying to put food in their mouths. They'd never hurt a soul!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_13.ogg Golden Alligator: If you need to take anyone, take me. Please, let them go!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_14.ogg Golden Alligator: It was me that disrespected you... they never did, and never would!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: Is that right?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: Fine. Seems like you've got a heart in there somewhere, seeing how you treat your crew... I'll let you off the hook this time.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: Get outta here!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_15.ogg Golden Alligator: Thank you, Captain Beidou! Thank you!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: Wait!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_16.ogg Golden Alligator: Yes? What else might the merciful and mighty Beidou require?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: This treasure is still up for grabs. The Crux Fleet honors the rule of first-come, first-served.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: You found it first. So, name your price.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: I can't have any rumors going around about Captain Beidou stealing other people's treasure, can I?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_17.ogg Golden Alligator: Captain Beidou, we wouldn't dare take Mora from you!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_18.ogg Golden Alligator: T—Take the treasure as an apology for my foolish words!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_19.ogg Golden Alligator: Please, take it. Please.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_11.ogg Beidou: Oh? Well, if you insist...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_12.ogg Beidou: I accept your kind offer, and I'll make you one in return. You don't seem like terrible folks, so let me help you get onto the right track.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_13.ogg Beidou: If you want to mend your ways and put all this behind you, The Crux can probably arrange some odd jobs in the port for you.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_14.ogg Beidou: It'd be humble work, but at least it'd get you on your feet and making an honest living — a much better deal than what you've got going now, if you ask me.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_20.ogg Golden Alligator: Wow, uh... thank you, Captain Beidou! On behalf of me and all my boys.

Were You Expecting Someone Else?[]

(Investigate suspicious locations nearby)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: Right, let's see what we've got in here...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: Tsk... This isn't what we're looking for.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: Let's look around. Maybe we'll find it.
(Approaching some rocks)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: Those rocks look... kinda weird.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: Let's see if there's anything there...
(Destroy the rocks)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: Nothing... Hmm, let's keep looking.
(Approaching a group of hilichurls)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: What are those hilichurls digging for?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: Wait, actually, I've heard they sometimes dig for buried treasure. Let's go take a closer look, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: Nope, not here either.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: Now that we've searched all the places of interest in this area, and come up with nothing... (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), you got any ideas?
 What is the treasure you're looking for?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: It's a...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_01.ogg Golden Alligator: Captain Beidou! Captain Beidou!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: Huh? What brings you back here?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_02.ogg Golden Alligator: Captain Beidou! Actually, we've just been wandering around nearby... we didn't go far...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_03.ogg Golden Alligator: Because we were thinking about what you said, and...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_04.ogg Golden Alligator: Well... Me and the boys decided that... we're ready to move away from all of this and get on the straight and narrow!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: Oh? Are you sure?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_05.ogg Golden Alligator: Yes! Absolutely sure!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: Okay then. But I'll warn you right now that you won't have it easy. It might just be menial work in the port, but in the eyes of the general public, you'll be associates of The Crux.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: So there'll be a grueling test you have to go through before you can start.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_06.ogg Golden Alligator: I understand! I understand!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_07.ogg Golden Alligator: Truth be told, Captain, it's only because it's you, the mighty and honorable Captain Beidou. If it'd been anyone else, I don't think I'd have listened.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_08.ogg Golden Alligator: And since you've made us this kind offer, I'd like to ask, if I might be so bold... is there any hope at all for us to become full members of The Crux in the future? Even the tiniest shred of hope?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_11.ogg Beidou: Hmph, well there's no place in The Crux for delusions of grandeur, that's for sure!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_12.ogg Beidou: But then again... everybody has to start somewhere.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_13.ogg Beidou: So it comes down to you. If you manage to impress me, and earn the respect of my crew...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_14.ogg Beidou: ...then yeah. Nothing's impossible.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_09.ogg Golden Alligator: Thank you, Captain Beidou! Thank you a thousand times over!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_10.ogg Golden Alligator: I couldn't help but notice you were searching for something else. It still hasn't turned up?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_15.ogg Beidou: Why, do you have any clues?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_11.ogg Golden Alligator: We heard about two treasures, both in Guili Plains. We were still looking for the first one when you found us.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_12.ogg Golden Alligator: So maybe the other one might be what you're looking for?
 Where is it?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_13.ogg Golden Alligator: Not too far from here, but I'm just not sure of the exact location...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_14.ogg Golden Alligator: All the info we got about this treasure came from the black market. The answer's hidden inside a poem, which goes like this:
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_15.ogg Golden Alligator: "Drunkenly I gazed at the ruins long forsaken, and lay beneath red leaves whose branches cast a crooked shade. The dusk sun shone upon the sea as I awakened, but Guyun stood twixt weary eyes and the sight of home they crave."
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_16.ogg Golden Alligator: As for the "ruins long forsaken" part, I do know of some ruins near here.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_17.ogg Golden Alligator: But beyond that line... I just... I don't...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_18.ogg Golden Alligator: *sigh* I'm just not smart enough!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_16.ogg Beidou: Haha, so a treasure clue hidden in a poem, huh? Don't worry, we got this.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_17a.ogg Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_17b.ogg Beidou: See my friend here? If they taught treasure hunting as an art form, you'd probably be calling (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) "Grandmaster." This kind of thing's a piece of cake for (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍).
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_18.ogg Beidou: Am I right, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 Ahem... let's maybe head to the site first?
 Ahem... I have no interest in being a grandmaster of anything.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_19.ogg Beidou: Haha, okay then, let's start by heading to the site and surveying the scene. Maybe we'll find some other clues over there.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_19.ogg Golden Alligator: O—Okay! Come on, boys! You heard the captain — lead the way!

Poetic Treasure[]

(Go to the "ruins long forsaken")
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905305_goldenalligator_01.ogg Golden Alligator: These are the "long forsaken ruins" from the poem. Apparently, they were once full of treasure.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905305_goldenalligator_02.ogg Golden Alligator: But judging by the state of them now, it's probably long gone.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905305_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: Hmm, it seems that we need to dig deeper into this poem.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905305_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: "Drunkenly I gazed at the ruins long forsaken, and lay beneath red leaves whose branches cast a crooked shade. The dusk sun shone upon the sea as I awakened, but Guyun stood twixt weary eyes and the sight of home they crave."
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905305_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), do you have any ideas?
 Maybe "gazed at the ruins" means the writer wasn't right here, but...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905305_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: ...Ah, somewhere you can see the ruins from? So, somewhere not too far from here?
 The second line means there's probably a red-leaved tree around...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905305_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: Yeah... and maybe the shadow cast by the tree is supposed to hint at something?
 The third line... perhaps the "dusk sun" has something to do with the timing?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905305_goldenalligator_03.ogg Golden Alligator: Oh! I got it! This guy fell asleep and woke up just before sunset!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905305_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: Dusk and the shadow of a red-leaved tree... hmm, I think we can work with that.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905305_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: Let's take a look around, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). I think we're getting close.

 Step DescriptionYou analyzed the clues given in the poem... "Drunkenly I gazed at the ruins long forsaken" may mean to gaze upon a ruin from afar, while the key sections of "and lay beneath red leaves whose branches cast a crooked shade" are "a tree with red leaves" and "shadows." "The dusk sun shone upon the sea as I awakened" on the other hand could refer to time...

(Follow the clues in the poem to look for the treasure)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: Found it! At long last, the treasure is finally in our hands... A check from the Northland Bank.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: You really came through, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). We found the spot in no time.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: Without your help, I don't think I ever would have gotten my hands on it.
 I was expecting it to be something a little more unique.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: To us, this is just a check that you can exchange at Northland Bank for some Mora.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: But to some people, it's of huge importance.
 Is it worth a lot of Mora?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: Not much, but enough for an average person to survive on for a while. But there's more to this particular check than that.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: When I found the treasure map, it was tightly sealed inside a small bottle along with a letter.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_11.ogg Beidou: I'll let you read it for yourself.
Neatly-Written Note
If you find this bottle, I may no longer be in this world.
I originally thought that these pirates, having their ways and means, might be able to send me back to Liyue, which was why I got onboard their ship. I never expected that...
Ah, forget it. I suppose this is what they call destiny...
Before I came to Inazuma, I worried that my old mother's place would be burgled, as she lives alone, so I left a check for all the Mora I've saved over these past few years buried in the location marked out on this map. Please help me retrieve that check and exchange it at the Northland Bank. The Mora will then be yours to do with as you please, save for a small portion that I would like used to pay my mother's living expenses. Her name is Minamoto Kotomi, and she lives in the Guili Plains. Please do this for me, and thank you!
 
I'm sorry, Mother. I found loads of those Sakura Blooms that could be found all over your homeland, but it's a shame that I cannot send them to your side.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_12.ogg Beidou: Finished?
 So, it's the dying wish of a man who met a tragic fate.
 So, it's the last will of a faithful son.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_13.ogg Beidou: Yeah. I can't fault him for what he did, but the way things turned out... All I can say is, life is unpredictable.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_14.ogg Beidou: Well, let's fulfill his final wish by taking this check to where it belongs.
(Obtain  Northland Bank Check)
(Obtain  Neatly-Written Note)

To the Rightful Owner, Returned[]
 Step DescriptionBeidou tells you about the origin of this check. Time to send it where it belongs...

(Go to the wooden house by the sea)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: Well, this is it. Oh, boys! It's time for your first job!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: Give this check to the old lady who lives in that wooden hut. Tell her it's a welfare payment from the Liyue Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905304_goldenalligator_01.ogg Golden Alligator: Yes, Boss!
 Ahem...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: What's up?
 I have some Sakura Blooms that I picked up in Inazuma. I want her to have them, too.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: Haha, I see...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: But you only find Sakura Blooms in certain places, right? It must have been quite a bit of work collecting all these, surely?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: Let's just pick one, huh? One's enough to show that you care.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: You've already helped me out so much today.
You take out a Sakura Bloom.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: Okay! Off you go, then. Take her the Sakura Bloom along with the check, and if she asks, tell her...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_11.ogg Beidou: ...your child in a faraway land sends his best wishes.

Ending: Sakura Blooms Upon Guili Fell[]


Sakura Blooms Upon Guili Fell


Aether
Lumine







As the sakura from one's homeland sink into the sea, so too the wandering son's thoughts are delivered to his mother...

Trivia[]
During "To the Rightful Owner, Returned," before continuing the quest, Minamoto Kotomi can be found standing outside of her house. She cannot be interacted with.

Small-Scale Changes[]

(Talk to Hirano)
You tell Hirano about the housekeeping class...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 hirano 01.ogg Hirano: Housekeeping, you say...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 hirano 02.ogg Hirano: You know, since it's Thoma teaching, I'd definitely be up for going.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 hirano 03.ogg Hirano: Unfortunately, I have quite a lot going on over the next couple of days... but could I swing by once my schedule's freed up? I'd definitely like to give it a try.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: No problem at all. You can join whenever you like.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 hirano 04.ogg Hirano: Thanks, Thoma!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 hirano 05.ogg Hirano: Also, this isn't really my place, but if you're starting a housekeeping class — haven't you thought about asking Furuta?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 hirano 06.ogg Hirano: As the Kamisato Clan's butler, I'm sure she'd know a lot about housekeeping.
 Sounds like someone we should speak to.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Sure, let's go pay her a visit.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Let's hope this goes smoothly...

(Talk to Furuta)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 furuta 01.ogg Furuta: Ah, Thoma and a guest. This is a rare combination.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 furuta 02.ogg Furuta: Has something happened?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Not at all! We were just... thinking of starting a housekeeping class.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 furuta 03.ogg Furuta: A housekeeping class? How wonderful. Do you know, I've always wanted to have Koharu learn from you. Finally, the time has come.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 furuta 04.ogg Furuta: I'm guessing you intend to open the class up to the whole Yashiro Commission? Not just housekeeping staff and servants, right?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 furuta 05.ogg Furuta: In which case, why don't you do a big spring-clean of the Commission itself? It would be a great way to showcase your methods.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 furuta 06.ogg Furuta: Seeing is believing, after all. You could spend a long time trying to convince them with words alone — or you could let them see you in action with their own eyes.
 Sounds like a good idea, actually...
 Are you sure this is a good idea?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: I like Furuta's suggestion, and it's not like we have a better idea anyway.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: In which case, heck, why not — let's showcase the appeal of housekeeping for all in the Yashiro Commission to see!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911501 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: Let's get started, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!
The big cleanup attracts onlookers from the Yashiro Commission

(If you fail the challenge)
That won't do, let's try that again.
(Proceed to previous step)
(After clearing 3 bushes)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: ...And the flowers will really flourish now that the weeds are gone.
(After clearing all bushes)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: While we're here, though, we should water the trees.

(After completing the challenge)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911505 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Whew... the whole Yashiro Commission looks as good as new.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911505 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: We had a lot of spectators, huh. I wonder if we managed to get any of them interested.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911505 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Either way, thanks for your help, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo tmcop001 1911505 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: I usually handle all of this stuff on my own. Having you join me today was a pretty great experience.
 It's nothing.
 Fingers crossed your class goes well.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911505 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Here's hoping! I'll set out some tables and chairs tonight. I've got no idea how many people will show up tomorrow.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911505 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Make sure you get some good rest tonight. I'll see you tomorrow!

(Go to the Yashiro Commission to take part in the housekeeping course)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Welcome, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!
 Not many people have showed up...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Haha, don't be too upset. This is normal.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: With things like this, you can't expect to change people's views overnight. It takes time and effort.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Well then, looks like I'm all yours for this class. I mentioned earlier about sewing up your clothes for you, didn't I?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: I also want to take this opportunity to teach you how to knit a sweater. That way, you'll be able to make yourself some warm clothes before the winter comes.
 I didn't manage to get you the respect you deserved...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: Haha, the fact that you're so ready to look out for me has already made me very happy.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: But really, it doesn't bother me at all. Once in a while, someone takes issue with my background, interests, or the nature of my work, and that's okay. You can't expect everyone in life to see things the way you do.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: People are always going to talk. It's in their nature, and you can't do much to stop them. I don't mind what they say about me — what I care about is the wellbeing of the Kamisato Clan.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: But that's enough about all that. Come on, grab your needle and let's get knitting.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: Let's start with a classic stockinette stitch. First, wrap the yarn around, pull it through here, then hang it on the needle...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: Put your thumb on the yarn here, index finger here, and pull it tight.
 Like this?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: You learn pretty quick! But you need to pay close attention to this...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 17.ogg Thoma: Exactly, just like that. Now, set yourself a small goal to start with, for example, knit a scarf by the time winter arrives.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 18.ogg Thoma: Scarves are always a great choice. When it's finished, you can either wear it yourself, or gift it to a friend!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911502 thoma 19.ogg Thoma: Just imagining it warms my heart.

The Church's Affairs[]

(Arriving at location)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900301 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Ahh... Glad we've finally made it out of there. The Wolvendom forest is a nice getaway to be alone for a while, but there's not much sunlight...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900301 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: If you stay in there for too long, you can't help but start feeling a little gloomy.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900301 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: A little sunlight always helps keep your spirits up!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900301 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: Ah yes, now that we're here, I'd like to go to Dawn Winery and check on Tunner's condition.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900301 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: I've told him before that he should take it easy and rest for a while, but he never seems to listen... He even told me not to let Guy know anything about it.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900301 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: I'd like to check on him before going back and deciding which medicine I'll need to make.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900301 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: Umm, would it be possible to... you know... ask for your help again? If you could go back and report to Sister Victoria while I check on Tunner, that would be a big help!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900301 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: She's most certainly worried about me after being away so long.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900301 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: And besides, there's a lot of matters I still need to take care of back at the Cathedral... It would be better if I let her know the situation.
 Perhaps it'd be better for you to tell her yourself...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900301 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: Oh... you must have other matters to attend to... No problem then. I guess I'll go talk to her myself.
(Barbara leaves to settle this matter alone...)
(Hangout event ended)
 Leave it to us!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900301 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: Aww, thank you so much! I truly appreciate it.
(Continue to Cleanliness First)

Cleanliness First[]

(Reporting to Sister Victoria)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900302 victoria 01.ogg Victoria: Oh, you're back again. If you're looking for Sister Barbara... she's yet to return.
 We found Barbara in Wolvendom.
 Barbara is at Dawn Winery checking on Tunner.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900302 victoria 02.ogg Victoria: Oh, I see... Thank Barbatos that she's alright.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900302 victoria 03.ogg Victoria: But it sounds like she won't be back any time soon... Hmm, perhaps I'll have to pass her responsibilities in the Cathedral to someone else...
 We can help.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900302 victoria 04.ogg Victoria: Oh, well that's most kind of you. I certainly wouldn't want to trouble you...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900302 victoria 05.ogg Victoria: Hmm.. Let me think for a moment... Ah yes, you could help tidy up around the Cathedral a bit.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900302 victoria 06.ogg Victoria: People tend to bring dust in as they come into the Cathedral, so the floor is often quite dirty.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900302 victoria 07.ogg Victoria: Cleaning and the like have always been Sister Barbara's responsibility... So the moment she's gone, everything starts getting dirty...
 Barbara is responsible for a cleaning place this huge by herself?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900302 victoria 08.ogg Victoria: Yes, that's right. She always said she could handle it herself and that there's no need to ask anyone else to help her.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900302 victoria 09.ogg Victoria: But she does often appear quite exhausted after she's finished with the cleaning.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900302 victoria 10.ogg Victoria: To be honest, I'm most surprised that you're willing to help... Or rather, that Barbara is willing to let you help.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900302 victoria 11.ogg Victoria: However, this would help lighten her burden.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900302 victoria 12.ogg Victoria: Anyway, I'll let you handle the cleaning for now, Honorary Knight.
(Talk to Sister Victoria again)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900302 victoria 14.ogg Victoria: Your kindness will not go unnoticed, Honorary Knight. Barbatos bless you.
(After cleaning the Cathedral)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900304 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: ...Well, that should just about do it for the cleaning... Could Barbara really do this all herself?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900304 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon's starting to think that she works much harder than we imagined...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900304 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Anyway, let's head back to Sister Victoria.
(Continue to Deaconess's Gratitude)

Deaconess's Gratitude[]

(Heading back to Sister Victoria)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Sister Victoria told me you already helped tidy up the Cathedral! Thank you so much!
 When did you get back?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: I just returned a short while ago. I can't thank you enough for how much you've helped me today, both here in the Cathedral and back in Wolvendom...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: You must be thirsty after so much work, no? How about I treat you to a drink?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: Oh, I've just remembered that the Cat's Tail is promoting a special drink recently.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: Miss Margaret said that the name of the drink is "Fantastic Summer-Serendipity Coral Sparkling Tea," haha!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: She also mentioned that it's her secret weapon to beating Angel's Share in drink sales.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: Word is that the drink's pretty good, but there's always a line to get it. We'll probably have to wait if we want some...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: If you'd rather not stand in line, I could make you a glass of my very own Chilibrew.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: Which would you like to drink?
 Fantastic Summer-Serendipity Coral Sparkling Tea does sound pretty amazing. (This dialogue option leads to The Cat's Tail's Specialty.)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 22.ogg Barbara: Yeah, it does sound amazing. I'm not sure how Margaret came up with such a name...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 23.ogg Barbara: But I have heard that the drink is quite popular now. There's even a line of people waiting to purchase it every day.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 24.ogg Barbara: If you'd like to get one, we should head over to the Cat's Tail as quickly as we can.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 25.ogg Barbara: However... even though I've already requested a half day of leave from Sister Victoria, she still insists that I let her know where I'm going...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 26.ogg Barbara: With so many people trying to get in on the newest Cat's Tail offering, I'm worried we'll have to wait for ages if we get there too late.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 27.ogg Barbara: Ah, I've got it! Why don't you help me check in with Sister Victoria while I get in line at the Cat's Tail? That would save us some time!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 28.ogg Barbara: What do you think?
 Sounds good to me.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 29.ogg Barbara: It's settled then! Let's meet up at the entrance to the Cat's Tail.
 But what if you run into people asking for an autograph?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 30.ogg Barbara: I—It'll be fine... I'll just tell them that today is my day off. I'm sure they'll understand.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 31.ogg Barbara: Let's get going then. See you at the Cat's Tail!

(Talk to Sister Victoria)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 01.ogg Victoria: Yes, my child?
 About Barbara's time off...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 02.ogg Victoria: Oh yes, Sister Barbara just submitted her request for half a day's leave. She said she had plans with a friend.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 03.ogg Victoria: I must say though, it is quite unusual for Barbara to request time off just to see a friend...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 04.ogg Victoria: But that's beside the point. What is it you'd like to ask me?
 About "Fantastic Summer-Serendipity Coral Sparkling Tea"...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 05.ogg Victoria: Oh? You mean to tell me that Barbara intends to accompany you to buy this... special drink?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 06.ogg Victoria: Then you must be the friend that she mentioned, I presume?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 07.ogg Victoria: Hmm, seeing as you're the Honorary Knight, I guess that's fine...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 08.ogg Victoria: Well, then please take good care of Sister Barbara.
 Why does Barbara always have to report her plans?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 09.ogg Victoria: Well, as you may already know, Sister Barbara is quite popular in Mondstadt for several reasons...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 10.ogg Victoria: Although the citizens here may only be acting out of good intention, there are too many of them, and Sister Barbara can't handle it all
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 11.ogg Victoria: If they appear while she is working here at the Church, we can come and intervene.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 12.ogg Victoria: But if she's approached by fans during her time off, then she can only fend for herself.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 13.ogg Victoria: And no to mention, she's too... kind. She'll always try to fulfill the requests of the citizens of Mondstadt, even when it takes a heavy toll and leaves her more exhausted than actual working hours.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 14.ogg Victoria: So with that in mind, we thought we'd have Sister Barbara always tell us where she'd be, just in case we need to come rescue her from the crowds.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 15.ogg Victoria: My hope is that Sister Barbara stops pushing herself so hard...
(Continue to A Very Special Beverage)
 I would like to try your special Chilibrew! (This dialogue option leads to The First Chilibrew Ingredient or The Second Chilibrew Ingredient.)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: Coming right up! But I should warn you, the flavor is quite unique, I'm not sure how you'll handle it.
 I should be fine... I think...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: Alright, let me think... to make this drink, we'll need some fresh Jueyun Chilis and Sweet Flowers.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: The key to a good batch of Chilibrew is not the quantity of ingredients, but the quality of ingredients.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 13.ogg Barbara: I know where to gather fresh Jueyun Chilis, but Sweet Flowers might be a bit tricky... Though they're easy to find, high-quality Sweet Flowers are few and far between...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 14.ogg Barbara: Oh, why don't we split up to search for ingredients? Once we've found the ingredients we need, we can meet up just south of the Whispering Woods.
 Alright, let's split up. (This dialogue option leads to The First Chilibrew Ingredient.)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 15.ogg Barbara: Alright, I'll head to the Whispering Woods to gather Sweet Flowers while you go search for Jueyun Chilis around Stone Gate.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 16.ogg Barbara: Oh, and by the way... Even though I've already requested a half day's leave from Sister Victoria, she always insists that I still give her my itinerary for any trips I take.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 17.ogg Barbara: While I head over to the Whispering Woods, could you please check in with Sister Victoria and let her know where I will be?

(Talk to Sister Victoria)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900307 victoria 01.ogg Victoria: Yes, my child?
 About Barbara's itinerary...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900307 victoria 02.ogg Victoria: Oh? Sister Barbara wishes to go to the Whispering Woods to pick herbs?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900307 victoria 03.ogg Victoria: I see... In fact, Sister Barbara just requested a half day's leave to go meet a friend. Now she suddenly intends to go herb-picking?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900307 victoria 04.ogg Victoria: I'm sure Sister Barbara has her reasons... Will you be accompanying her?
 Yes, I will be accompanying her.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900307 victoria 05.ogg Victoria: Ah, I trust she will be in good hands then. Please take good care of Sister Barbara, Honorary Knight.
 Why does Barbara always have to report her plans?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900307 victoria 06.ogg Victoria: Well, as you may already know, Sister Barbara is quite popular in Mondstadt for several reasons...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900307 victoria 07.ogg Victoria: Although the citizens here may only be acting out of good intention, there are too many of them, and Sister Barbara can't handle it all
Media:vo bblcop001 1900307 victoria 08.ogg Victoria: If they appear while she is working here at the Church, we can come and intervene.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900307 victoria 09.ogg Victoria: But if she's approached by fans during her time off, then she can only fend for herself.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900307 victoria 10.ogg Victoria: And no to mention, she's too... kind. She'll always try to fulfill the requests of the citizens of Mondstadt, even when it takes a heavy toll and leaves her more exhausted than actual working hours.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900307 victoria 11.ogg Victoria: So with that in mind, we thought we'd have Sister Barbara always tell us where she'd be, just in case we need to come rescue her from the crowds.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900307 victoria 12.ogg Victoria: My hope is that Sister Barbara stops pushing herself so hard...
(Continue to The First Chilibrew Ingredient)
 I think it'd be better if we stick together. (This dialogue option leads to The Second Chilibrew Ingredient.)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 18.ogg Barbara: Oh, you really think so? Okay then.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 19.ogg Barbara: With the Honorary Knight by my side, I can gather ingredients without a care in the world!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 20.ogg Barbara: Oh, and by the way... Even though I've already requested a half day's leave from Sister Victoria, she always insists that I still give her my itinerary for any trips I take.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900303 barbara 21.ogg Barbara: We should go check in with Sister Victoria first. We could say... hmm... we're going out to gather some herbs!

(Talk to Sister Victoria)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 16.ogg Victoria: Oh? Sister Barbara, is something the matter?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: I'd like to go to the Whispering Woods to pick some herbs, it shouldn't take long!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 17.ogg Victoria: Oh? But didn't you just submit a request for half a day's leave to see a friend? Now you suddenly intend to go herb-picking?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 18.ogg Victoria: Hmm... I thought you would take a rest today...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 19.ogg Victoria: Still, you may do as you please with your plans, I won't interfere.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 20.ogg Victoria: But the Whispering Woods are quite a distance away, perhaps you should request a guard from the Knights of Favonius?
 I will accompany Barbara.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 barbara 02a.ogg Barbara: With the Honorary Knight by my side, I'm sure everything will be just fine!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 victoria 21.ogg Victoria: Thank you for informing me, I've noted down your plans. Please do come back soon.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Thank you.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900306 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: Alright, we're good to go. Let's head out!

Sister Victoria's Vexation[]

(Talk to Sister Victoria)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900101 victoria 01.ogg Victoria: I sure hope Sister Barbara is okay...
 What's happened to Barbara?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900101 victoria 02.ogg Victoria: Sister Barbara said that she was going out to pick some herbs earlier, but I'm afraid that she has yet to return.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900101 victoria 03.ogg Victoria: Hmm... Perhaps I should report the matter to the Knights of Favonius.
 I'll go search for Barbara.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900101 victoria 04.ogg Victoria: You? Well, I guess as the Honorary Knight, you may very well be a good fit for the task...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900101 victoria 05.ogg Victoria: Not to mention it would save me the trouble of reporting the matter to the Knights...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900101 victoria 06.ogg Victoria: Alright, I'll leave it to you. Before sister Barbara departed, she said that she was headed to Wolvendom to pick some herbs.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900101 victoria 07.ogg Victoria: You could start by looking for her there.
(Talk to Sister Victoria again)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900302 victoria 13.ogg Victoria: Sister Barbara... Where have you gone?

(Talk to Barbara at Wolvendom)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900102 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Huh, how strange... I can't seem to find any...
 Barbara, I've finally found you.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900102 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: O—Oh, it's you! What are you doing here? Is something the matter?
 You'd been gone for some time, we decided to come looking for you.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900102 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Oh, I see. No need to worry, there hasn't been any sign of danger. I'm just here to gather some red Wolfhook berries, that's all.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900102 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: But the strange thing is, there should be lots of them here... and I can't seem to find any.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900102 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: Hmm, anyway, no need to worry about me. I'll just have another look around here, and if I can't find any, I'll just—
Media:vo bblcop001 1900102 albert 01.ogg ???: Miss Barbara... Hmm...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900102 albert 02.ogg ???: She's not here either...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900102 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: Huh? Somebody seems to be coming this way?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900102 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: Oh, I'm sorry, but... please, just keep quiet, okay? Don't let them find us...
 Why would you want to hide?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900102 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: Because... Well, just because...
 Just wait here, we'll go send that person away. (This dialogue option leads to Sudden Shouting.)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900102 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: O—Oh, alright... I'll just leave it to you, then.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900102 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: Please, just... just don't tell them that I'm here, alright?
(Continue to Sudden Shouting)
 Let's go deeper into the forest and wait for them to leave. (This dialogue option leads to Temporary Relief From the Fanfare.)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900102 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: Alright then... Let's head this way.
(Go to Temporary Relief From the Fanfare)

(After talking to Barbara)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900108 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: That voice seemed to be coming from over there...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900108 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's go take a closer look.
(Talk to Barbara again)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900102 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: Strange... who could it be?

Temporary Relief From the Fanfare[]

(Follow Barbara)
(Talk to Barbara)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Shh.. Keep your voice down. We mustn't let that person find us here.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: ...This should be a good spot. Let's wait here for a while.
 Why are you trying to avoid being seen?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Well... it's a little embarrassing to say, but...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: In Mondstadt, I often perform songs for people. Because it's been so well received, the other sisters have started encouraging me to perform across Teyvat. Now, more and more people are showing up to hear me perform.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: I'm happy to see such turnouts, don't get me wrong... but... Now, people always stop me on the street when I go shopping, or when I go out for personal matters...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: I know that all they want is to get my autograph, or to ask me how I'm doing, which isn't a bad thing.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: And... I'm very thankful for all my fans, but... there are simply too many of them.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: I always do my best to fulfill their requests and not let them down.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: But... sometimes... I feel that I just don't have the strength to do so.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: Even when I'm in the church, people will still come hoping to greet me. I'm constantly in a state of tension, no matter where I go.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: The reason I came here was not only to find Wolfhooks for making Tunner's cough medicine, but also to have some quiet time alone...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: Do you understand that feeling? To sit peacefully and not think about anything... just by yourself. It's simply the feeling of relaxation.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 13.ogg Barbara: It's been far too long since I've had that feeling. Before I knew it, I was out here all day and forgot to return to the city.
 If you're looking for Wolfhooks, there should be plenty nearby.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 14.ogg Barbara: Well, yes, there are plenty of the normal variety... but I'm looking for red Wolfhook. No matter how hard I look, I can't seem to find any. I clearly remember that they always grow here.
 Let's wait for that person to leave and then we can go look for some.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 15.ogg Barbara: I guess that's all we can do for now. Although, it certainly isn't nice to treat someone that way... But today, I simply wish to keep to myself.
 It's alright, this is a perfect place for two people to spend some time together. (This dialogue option leads to the end of the hangout.)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 16.ogg Barbara: Wh— Huh? Wh—What do you mean? Y—You...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 17.ogg Barbara: I—I'm sorry. I think we should go... Yes, it's time to go!
(Barbara leaves in a hurry...)
(Hangout event ended)
 So what made you decide to join the Church, Barbara? (This dialogue option leads to Of Wolfhooks Red.)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 18.ogg Barbara: Well, my father has always worked at the Church... And the Church has always looked after me.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 19.ogg Barbara: I guess it was only natural for me to join the Church when I grew up.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 20.ogg Barbara: And besides, my sister works in the Knights of Favonius...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 21.ogg Barbara: I can't even begin to compare with her! Not only is she adept with a blade, she's also capable of shouldering all the Knights of Favonius' matters on her own.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 22.ogg Barbara: I guess that's just who she is. I've never been able to come close to competing with her.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 23.ogg Barbara: Aside from singing and performing, I don't really have any abilities worth mentioning. Besides, my singing alone could never truly heal the wounds of others.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 24.ogg Barbara: I suppose that's another reason why I decided to join the Church — to learn how to truly heal others.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 25.ogg Barbara: Though I may not be particularly skilled in battle, being able to heal the wounds of others is good in its own right. At least, that's what I think.
 Does that mean I can come to you when I need healing, too?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 26.ogg Barbara: Of course! You are the Honorary Knight, after all. Feel free to find me for healing anytime!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 27.ogg Barbara: Alright, then! That person should be long gone by now. I still need to find some of those Wolfhooks.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 28.ogg Barbara: I can't seem to find any of the red variety anywhere...
 I'll lend you a hand.
 We can go look together.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 29.ogg Barbara: Your help would be much appreciated! Let's search the nearby area, I'm sure we'll find some in no time.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 30.ogg Barbara: Strange... I'm almost certain I've seen lots of red Wolfhooks growing here before...
(Go to Of Wolfhooks Red)
 Wouldn't your family worry about you picking herbs all alone? (This dialogue option leads to Of Wolfhooks Red.)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 31.ogg Barbara: My family? Well, my father left on an expedition together with Grand Master Varka and has yet to return.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 32.ogg Barbara: And as for the other person I can call family... Well, she doesn't have much time to look after me.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 33.ogg Barbara: And besides, I'm more than capable of taking care of myself, so there's no need for me to bother her.
 Ah yes, Grand Master Varka. I remember he's...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 34.ogg Barbara: That's right! The Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius. I'm sure you've heard his name mentioned before.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 35.ogg Barbara: Seamus Pegg... Cardinal of Daybreak and the Seneschal of the Church of Favonius.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 36.ogg Barbara: That's my father.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 37.ogg Barbara: But it's been some time since I last saw him, and I'm still uncertain of when Grand Master Varka's expedition will finally be finished.
 What was the purpose of Grand Master Varka's expedition?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 38.ogg Barbara: I don't know... My father only briefly mentioned the matter to me before he set off.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 39.ogg Barbara: He also turned over all his responsibilities in the Church to Cardinal Calvin.
 I don't think I've ever met this "Cardinal Calvin."
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 40.ogg Barbara: Cardinal Calvin has been taking care of various matters since the departure of my father and Grand Master Varka. He's so busy that he seldom ever leaves his room. Even the other sisters in the Church rarely ever see him.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 41.ogg Barbara: The only time I've seen him recently was when the Holy Lyre der Himmel was stolen. He went to the Knights of Favonius in such a hurry that he hadn't even fastened all the buttons on his garments.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 42.ogg Barbara: Speaking of which, you still remember that day, right? You recovered the Holy Lyre der Himmel together with that bard and Jean... Uh, I mean, the Acting Grand Master.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 43.ogg Barbara: ...I was shocked to see the Holy Lyre der Himmel in such a condition. Thank the heavens that the bard was able to mend it.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 44.ogg Barbara: We'd never hear the end of it from Cardinal Calvin if something were to ever happen to the Holy Lyre der Himmel.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 45.ogg Barbara: Huh? What do you two seem so nervous about?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 46.ogg Barbara: There's nothing wrong with the Holy Lyre der Himmel... is there?
 (Look at Barbara with an innocent gaze.)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 48.ogg Barbara: Well... anyway. At least the Holy Lyre der Himmel is fixed...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 49.ogg Barbara: Never mind the lyre for now. I think that person should be long gone — and I still need to pick those Wolfhooks.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 50.ogg Barbara: ...I can't seem to find any of the red variety anywhere...
 I'll lend you a hand.
 We can go look together.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 51.ogg Barbara: Your help would be much appreciated! Let's search the nearby area, I'm sure we'll find some in no time.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 52.ogg Barbara: Strange... I'm almost certain I've seen lots of red Wolfhooks growing here before...
(Go to Of Wolfhooks Red)
 Th—The Holy Lyre? Oh... Um, I wouldn't know... (−1 Heart)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 53.ogg Barbara: Huh? But didn't you return the lyre together with Acting Grand Master Jean and that bard?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 54.ogg Barbara: And then, that bard used some sort of magic to fix the broken Holy Lyre der Himmel...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 55.ogg Barbara: Hey! Why do you look so nervous?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 56.ogg Barbara: Is there something wrong with the Holy Lyre der Himmel?
 Wh—What do you mean? The Church is looking after it now, right?
 N—No, nothing's wrong with it... The bard fixed it, didn't he?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 57.ogg Barbara: I see...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 58.ogg Barbara: Never mind, we'll talk about it later. That person who was looking for me should be long gone by now, and I still need to go pick those Wolfhooks.
 I—I'll lend you a hand!
 We can go together!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 59.ogg Barbara: Oh, really? Well, your help would be much appreciated! Let's search the nearby area, I'm sure we'll find some in no time.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 60.ogg Barbara: Remember, we're looking for red Wolfhooks. Don't get them mixed up.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900103 barbara 61.ogg Barbara: Strange... I'm almost certain that I've seen lots of those red Wolfhooks growing here before...
(Go to Of Wolfhooks Red)
(Talk again to Barbara)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900106 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Strange, I can't seem to find those red Wolfhooks anywhere.

Of Wolfhooks Red[]

(When picking up a red Wolfhook)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900106 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh, these must be the red Wolfhook berries that Barbara is looking for.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900106 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's gather some and bring them back to her!
(Search for Barbara)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900104 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Oh! Were you able to find some red Wolfhook berries?
 Yes, here they are!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900104 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Let me have a look... Yep, that should be enough!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900104 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: But it's still strange, I know for sure that I've seen lots of red Wolfhooks growing here before...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900104 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: I wonder if someone had already gathered them all...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900104 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: Well, never mind... Thankfully, the berries you gathered should be just enough. Let's go!

Sango's Complaint Letter[]

(Go to Bantan Sango Detective Agency)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 ryuji 01.ogg Ryuuji: Welcome back, Mr. Heizou. I'm glad you're alright! How about some Tonkatsu? You must have missed the taste of home after so long!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Maybe next time, Ryuuji. Seems like somebody's been expecting me... and I'm afraid they're only gonna be disappointed once again.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 01.ogg Sango: Well well, look who it is. The great Detective Heizou... What nonsense were you talking about just now?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 02.ogg Sango: I've been worried about you, you know. So much so that I took the trouble to write that heartfelt letter to the Tenryou Commission. Well? Was it sufficiently flattering for you?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 ryuji 02.ogg Ryuuji: Uh oh, they're at it again.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Ahem, let's not waste (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)'s time, Sango. Just tell me, what do you want?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 03.ogg Sango: Hehe, fine by me. My request is simple: disclose all the details of the "Ryuuji Case." It's time you stop hiding the truth and let me investigate it thoroughly.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: First of all, that case has already been solved. Second, I've disclosed everything the Police Station has on the case. And third...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 04.ogg Sango: Enough, you can only fool Ryuuji with that. If you don't want to cooperate, I can assure you that I will write more letters to the Headquarters of the Tenryou Commission. I will not give up on this case.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Ugh...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: W—Wait, hold on, can someone please explain what's going on here? Paimon doesn't have a clue what you two are talking about.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 ryuji 03.ogg Ryuuji: *sigh* Alright, let me explain.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 ryuji 04.ogg Ryuuji: Several years ago, a terrible murder took place in the Police Station. I was still working at the Tenryou Commission then, and the victim was actually... my dear boss.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 ryuji 05.ogg Ryuuji: Due to various factors, I was deemed to be the top suspect, which is why it's called the "Ryuuji Case."
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 ryuji 06.ogg Ryuuji: Also, Heizou wasn't a part of the Police Station back then, he was a detective at the agency... Ahem, which at the time was called the "Bantan Sango & Heizou Detective Agency."
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh!? That's crazy! But wait, then why did Heizou leave?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 05.ogg Sango: Hmph!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 ryuji 07.ogg Ryuuji: After the incident, I was quickly convicted and sent to prison. Fortunately, Sango then promptly proved my innocence and caught the real murderer.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 06.ogg Sango: But that "murderer" was actually just a dummy to throw us off. Am I right, Detective Shikanoin?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Ugh...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 ryuji 08.ogg Ryuuji: Sango thought that everything went smoothly, so much so that she suspected the real murderer was someone else. Of course, Detective Heizou was also helping with the investigation, but after a long time, he still came up empty-handed.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 ryuji 09.ogg Ryuuji: Later on, he decided to join the Police Station to continue his investigation on the inside, which is why he left the detective agency.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 07.ogg Sango: Hah, that's what I thought too. I was foolish enough to believe that Detective Shikanoin and I shared a common goal.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 08.ogg Sango: But I was wrong about him. He has no sense of loyalty at all! He just wanted to become an official as a means of gaining fame and fortune.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: C'mon, stop exaggerating. Let me set the record straight here.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: First, I joined the Police Station long after that murder case happened, and it had nothing to do with any inside investigation. That's just somebody's wishful thinking.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Second, purely out of curiosity, I did investigate the case later from within the Police Station. My conclusion was that the suspect Sango had caught was in fact the real murderer.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: And lastly, when Sango didn't buy my conclusion and asked me to disclose all related case files from the Police Station, I did exactly as she asked. I didn't hide anything.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 09.ogg Sango: Hmph, he's lying right through his teeth!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: That's it, I want this to end once and for all. Since (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)'s my supervisor today, they have complete access to all the Police Station's files.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 11a.ogg Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 11b.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: If (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍)'s willing to help re-examine the case and arrives at the same conclusion that I did, then you won't have to doubt me anymore.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 10.ogg Sango: Whoa, huh?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 12.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Unless, you don't trust the Traveler?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 13.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Heh, c'mon, say it!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 11.ogg Sango: Hmph. It's not about whether the Traveler's trustworthy, I'm just wondering if you will interfere somehow...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 14.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hah! The thought never even crossed my mind.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 12a.ogg Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 12b.ogg Sango: You have to swear that you will not mislead the Traveler by any means, and let (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) investigate the truth on (‍hishisText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) own.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 15.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: No problem. Cross my heart, hope to die.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 13.ogg Sango: Well, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? Are you willing to help me with this? Will you agree to re-examine the Ryuuji Case and find the truth? You can bill me later for however much you'd like as compensation!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 ryuji 10.ogg Ryuuji: Sango! Really? However much they want!?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 14.ogg Sango: Money is valuable, no doubt, but pursuing the truth is the reason I started this agency. The Ryuuji Case is the only case I failed to solve. I am willing to give you anything.
 No need to go that far, I'll help you for free.
 No need, a simple "thank you" will be enough. I'll do my best.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 15.ogg Sango: Alright, I'm counting on you, Traveler.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 sango 16.ogg Sango: You hear that, Detective Shikanoin? Hah! Now we just need to wait and see!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 16.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Alright, alright, I got it. No need to keep yammering like that... you'll scare the kids next door.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906001 heizou 17.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: C'mon, let's go back to the Police Station, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
(Talk to Sango and Ryuuji again)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906002 sango 01.ogg Sango: Traveler, I believe you can find out the truth. That Shikanoin is hiding something, I just know it.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906002 ryuji 01.ogg Ryuuji: *sigh*... Sango and Detective Heizou are both great people, but when they're together, only arguing ensues.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906002 sango 02.ogg Sango: Oh suck it up, Ryuuji.

Ryuuji's Curious Case[]

(Return to the Tenryou Commission)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906002 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Alright, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), hang out here for a sec, I need to go to the archives to get the case files.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906002 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: For now, why don't you go and chat with Yoriki Owada over there? He worked on this case too back in the day.
 You seem to really want me to look into this.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906002 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: No no, you misunderstand. It's not that I want you to look into this, it's just that you're the only one who can.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906002 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You're the only one I can think of who Sango would ever believe. She trusts in both your qualities and abilities, so I hope your findings can finally convince her and put an end to this whole thing.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906002 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Sure, she's just writing complaint letters for now, but who knows what she will do in the future? Haha.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906002 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Alright, I'll go get those case files. You go ahead and talk to Yoriki Owada for a while.

(Talk to Owada)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 01.ogg Owada: Oh, hello there!
 Heizou sent me to talk to you about the Ryuuji Case...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 02.ogg Owada: The Ryuuji Case? So you want to re-investigate that one.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 03.ogg Owada: That was several years ago now, but I still remember it clearly. It's pretty hard to forget something like that.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 04.ogg Owada: Especially when the victim was the head of this Police Station. His name was Takatsukasa Isamu, the younger brother of Takatsukasa Susumu, head of the Takatsukasa Clan.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 05.ogg Owada: He was really one of a kind. Decisive, brave, and smart. He was much younger than me, and already had quite a reputation.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 06.ogg Owada: I'm sure he would have gone far in the Tenryou Commission, if only he was still alive. What a shame... Who would have guessed someone was plotting against him.
 They said Ryuuji was the top suspect.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 07.ogg Owada: Hehe, people will believe anything they hear. Everyone in the Police Station knew that Ryuuji saw Takatsukasa Isamu like a father.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 08.ogg Owada: Ryuuji was an orphan, you know. Before he joined the station, he had been taking odd jobs here and there. It was Isamu who really took him under his wing.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 09.ogg Owada: Ryuuji was simple and not particularly bright, but he was very loyal to those who treated him well.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 10.ogg Owada: He's also hard-working. Isamu must've seen these qualities in him and decided to keep Ryuuji by his side.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 11.ogg Owada: Ryuuji worked with him for years after that, and was even promoted to be his personal assistant. Do you really think Ryuuji would do anything to harm him?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So then why was Ryuuji convicted? Even Paimon can tell that's a mistake.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 12.ogg Owada: Here comes the interesting part of the case. Within a week and before all of the loose ends had even been tied up, Ryuuji received his conviction.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 13.ogg Owada: Moreover, it was signed by Madam Kujou Sara.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What!? Why would Sara do something like that...
 What do you think, Owada?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 14.ogg Owada: Hehe, I'm getting older now and my eyesight is poor. I can't see too clearly anymore.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 01.ogg Uesugi: Hey c'mon, Yoriki Owada, there's nothing to see! It's obvious that the Kujou Clan did it!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 15.ogg Owada: You can't just go around saying things like that, Uesugi. Those were just hearsay, there was no evidence.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 02.ogg Uesugi: That's not true. Traveler, you may be unaware that the Takatsukasa Clan has always been assisting the Kujou Clan in the Tenryou Commission, but who doesn't want to be the boss, right?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 03.ogg Uesugi: And Takatsukasa Isamu was the key figure for the Takatsukasa Clan to bring down the Kujou Clan! At that time, no one was held in higher regard than Isamu.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 04.ogg Uesugi: So naturally, the Kujou Clan saw him as a potential threat. Kujou Takayuki must have been planning it all along, that rascal.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 05.ogg Uesugi: Takayuki is able to control the Takatsukasa Clan as long as he’s [sic] in power. But by the time he retires, Isamu would have been at the apex of his political power, while Masahito and Kamaji of the Kujou Clan would still have been too young...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 06.ogg Uesugi: Heh, the two of 'em wouldn't stand a chance against Isamu. You think Kujou Takayuki would simply sit back while Isamu gained traction? So he decided to strike first!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 16.ogg Owada: You youngsters and your conspiracy theories.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 07.ogg Uesugi: No, it's true! It's the only way to explain it! Otherwise, why would an impartial person like Madam Kujou Sara sign Ryuuji's conviction so quickly?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 08.ogg Uesugi: They had to find a scapegoat to pacify the Takatsukasa Clan, so Kujou Takayuki must have told her to sign it immediately.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 09.ogg Uesugi: Ah, I'm not accusing Madam Kujou Sara of anything, mind you. I respect her very much, but maybe she had no other choice...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 17.ogg Owada: Hah, what do you know? I'm sure Madam Kujou Sara must have had her own reasons.
 What about the real murderer who was later caught by Sango?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 18.ogg Owada: The guy was a forensic expert who worked in the station named Shiroyama. I have to admit, he wasn't easy to track down.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 19.ogg Owada: That Sango really is something, though. She caught him without even breaking a sweat. It turned out that after poisoning Isamu, Shiroyama secretly took the poison to Ryuuji's place in order to frame him.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 20.ogg Owada: Later on, the poison was also found in the forensic office, but that was already after Shiroyama's death. He confessed everything in a testament.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 10.ogg Uesugi: That's right, he hung himself in the forensic office not long after Sango was on his trail, probably because he knew it was only a matter of time before he would be caught.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 11.ogg Uesugi: Of course, he didn't admit whether he had been prompted by Kujou Takayuki. He took the responsibility alone... I bet Kujou Takayuki promised him a sizable compensation. After all, Shiroyama had a family to feed.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 21.ogg Owada: There you go again, pulling conclusions out of thin air. There wasn't any evidence of that at all.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 12.ogg Uesugi: Tch! Listen, I can almost guarantee that it was the Takatsukasa Clan who invited Sango to investigate. We all knew that Ryuuji was just a scapegoat, you think the Takatsukasa Clan wouldn't figure that out? They're not stupid.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 13.ogg Uesugi: So, they were suspicious of the Kujou Clan, and invited Sango to take the case. However, the Kujou Clan were still a step ahead and were able to remove themselves from the situation before the whole thing blew up. They drove Shiroyama to take all the blame as well as his own life... A perfectly clean cut for the Kujou Clan.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 14.ogg Uesugi: With Shiroyama dead, there was no one left to testify. Even the Electro Archon herself wouldn't be able to do anything.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 owada 22.ogg Owada: Tsk, you make up stuff faster than a politician. It's a wonder nobody's asked you to be an adviser yet.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 15.ogg Uesugi: Hey, that's their loss!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: *sigh* The whole thing is starting to sound complicated...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hey, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), I brought the files.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I bet you got quite an earful just now, huh? Hehe, but don't believe everything they say. After all, people can tell you anything, and it's hard to separate truth from rumors without facts.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So, what really matters is the case files. Everything laid out here is all that the Police Station has about the case. Please, take a look.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Remember, you may find many clues during an investigation, but not all of them are useful. And in some cases, the clues you'll find will not only be useless, but downright misleading.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Also, if a clue cannot corroborate anything on its own, you can always compare it with other clues, and maybe then you'll find what you're looking for.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Okay, that should just about do it, I'm looking forward to your results!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hold on, what actually counts as a result?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Usually, you need to find two things from these clues: a proven motive and proven means. Once you can confirm these two things, the criminal can be proven guilty.
 I understand.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Alright, you can go ahead and get started now. I look forward to hearing your verdict.
(Talk to Uesugi)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 16.ogg Uesugi: Hey, Traveler. Investigating a case isn't so easy, is it? Don't worry, I'll tell you all you need to know.
 About President Sango...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 17.ogg Uesugi: Hah, Sango? The Takatsukasa Clan really hired an amazing detective, didn't they?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 18.ogg Uesugi: She comes to the station to submit applications every now and then, and has been constantly requesting to reinvestigate the Ryuuji Case. But Heizou has always prevented her from doing so. I really didn't expect that she'd go as far as writing a complaint letter, though. Whew, she's relentless.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 19.ogg Uesugi: As for why Heizou senpai has been keeping her away from the case, I think he's afraid that Sango would be putting herself in danger. After all, we're talking about the murder of an important man, that can be deep water if you're not careful...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 20.ogg Uesugi: Sango may run a detective agency, but in the end, she's just an ordinary person.
 So are they friends?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 21.ogg Uesugi: Uh well... not exactly. I've pretty much seen them argue every time they meet. But, Heizou might still consider her as an old friend. I heard that he used to work with Sango.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 22.ogg Uesugi: Sometimes he'd ask me to hand over less pressing cases to the detective agency. I guess he just wants to support Sango's business.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906003 uesugi 23.ogg Uesugi: Hehe, Heizou senpai is a good person, there's no doubt about that.
(Talk to Owada)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 owada 01.ogg Owada: Don't take anything Uesugi says too seriously. Just nod along...
 About Takatsukasa Isamu and Ryuuji...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 owada 02.ogg Owada: Oh, that? Well, let me see...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 owada 03.ogg Owada: Ryuuji saw Takatsukasa Isamu as his foster father, that's for sure. But I can't say whether Isamu helped Ryuuji without expecting anything in return.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 owada 04.ogg Owada: After all, Isamu was a resourceful person. A simple and naive person like Ryuuji wouldn't ever be suitable as an adviser, but he could certainly be a loyal and trustworthy aid.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 owada 05.ogg Owada: Isamu was expecting a child of his own later, but unfortunately he was killed before the child was ever born...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 owada 06.ogg Owada: Anyway, enough about all that... Aren't you here to investigate the case? You'd better get a move on.

(Read The Autopsy Report of Takatsukasa Isamu)
The Autopsy Report of Takatsukasa Isamu: The deceased, Takatsukasa Isamu, 41 years old, Police Station manager.
The Autopsy Report of Takatsukasa Isamu: Clothes intact at time of death. No visible trauma observed on the body, no sign of a struggle. The throat was congested and swollen, caused by a cold before his death.
The Autopsy Report of Takatsukasa Isamu: Local ulceration was found in the stomach and intestines, caused by a novel toxin found in the stomach contents. Stomach contents include: partially undigested soft rice residue; ...
The Autopsy Report of Takatsukasa Isamu: ...small volume of fish-liver paste residue, the main ingredient of which is highly-concentrated fish-liver extract, a valuable nutritional supplement; ...
The Autopsy Report of Takatsukasa Isamu: ...small volume of cold medicine residue containing a large amount of acidic fruit and vegetable extracts. Appears to be a specially prepared medicine from the Office of Forensic Science; ...
The Autopsy Report of Takatsukasa Isamu: ...small volume of novel toxin residue, which was found to be the same toxin discovered in the homes of Ryuuji and Shiroyama. Cause of death: abdominal mucous membrane disease plus respiratory and circulatory failure triggered by the novel toxin.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906005 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yikes... he ate all kinds of stuff!
(Read Ryuuji's Testimony)
Ryuuji's Testimony: "A week before the incident, Master Takatsukasa Isamu caught a cold and lost his appetite. Rice was all he could eat and he had been taking some special cold medicine."
Ryuuji's Testimony: "The night before the incident, he had yet to recover and was still busy with his work, so I was worried about his health. When Dr. Shiroyama came to deliver the medicine, I consulted him about a health supplement."
Ryuuji's Testimony: "Dr. Shiroyama said fish-liver paste could help boost his immune system, so I went to the forensic office to retrieve some and gave it to Master Takatsukasa..."
Ryuuji's Testimony: "But by the next day... Really, Master Takatsukasa was so kind to me, I swear I wouldn't ever do that to him!"
Media:vo lyycop001 1906009 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm, come to think of it, Shiroyama was a forensic doctor... He could easily pull off something like this.
(Read Shiroyama's Testament)
Shiroyama's Testament: "I murdered Takatsukasa Isamu. I poisoned his cold medicine."
Shiroyama's Testament: "Though he appeared to be honest and honorable in public, in secret, he asked me to search out a new type of poison to get rid of those who opposed him."
Shiroyama's Testament: "He also said that if I refused, he would have me thrown in prison. He used my family to blackmail me."
Shiroyama's Testament: "He left me with no choice. I killed him with a new type of poison that I had someone purchase for me at the International Trade Association... To protect myself, I later framed my colleague Ryuuji."
Shiroyama's Testament: "But now it's only a matter of time before the detective uncovers everything. I know that I've made a big mistake, and that there's no escaping it now. Only death awaits me. I merely ask that my family be spared."
Media:vo lyycop001 1906010 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, this is the key to proving that Shiroyama was the murderer, right? That is, if he was telling the truth, of course.
(Read Takatsukasa Isamu's Message)
Takatsukasa Isamu's Message: A note placed with Shiroyama's Testament. After comparing the handwriting, it was confirmed to have been written by the deceased, Takatsukasa Isamu.
Takatsukasa Isamu's Message: "Shiroyama, long time no see. I trust the thing I asked you for is in progress?"
Takatsukasa Isamu's Message: "I paid a visit to your home today while you weren't around. Thankfully, your wonderful wife welcomed me in... She's a fine woman. A perfect match for you."
Takatsukasa Isamu's Message: "Your wife is five months pregnant, I believe? Fancy that — my wife too."
Takatsukasa Isamu's Message: "I took the liberty of returning once more to provide her with some health supplements, even helped administer them to her myself. She was most grateful indeed."
Takatsukasa Isamu's Message: "You will be equally grateful to me, no doubt? Then don't keep me waiting."
Media:vo lyycop001 1906012 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Takatsukasa Isamu seems like a thoughtful person, but something about the tone sounds weird...
(Read the Conviction of Ryuuji)
Conviction of Ryuuji: The suspect, Ryuuji, 20 years old, Doushin, a subordinate of the deceased, Takatsukasa Isamu.
Conviction of Ryuuji: Ryuuji grew to resent his boss, Takatsukasa Isamu, following conflict at work. He then secretly bought a bottle of poison to kill him in revenge.
Conviction of Ryuuji: Unused poison was later found in the suspect Ryuuji's house. For the crime of premeditated murder, Ryuuji is ordered to remain in temporary incarceration awaiting trial. This file shall be kept as evidence.
Conviction of Ryuuji: Signed: Kujou Sara
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow, Ryuuji's conviction really was signed by Kujou Sara... But now we know she had it wrong.
(Read the Conviction of Shiroyama)
Conviction of Shiroyama: The suspect, Shiroyama, 22 years old, forensic doctor, a subordinate of the deceased, Takatsukasa Isamu.
Conviction of Shiroyama: Shiroyama grew to resent his boss, Takatsukasa Isamu, following conflict at work. He then secretly bought a bottle of poison to kill him in revenge.
Conviction of Shiroyama: Unused poison was later found in the suspect Shiroyama's office. In his testament, he confessed to having planted the poison found in Ryuuji's house.
Conviction of Shiroyama: For the crime of premeditated murder, Shiroyama is hereby sentenced to death. Punishment cannot be carried out as the suspect ended his own life before the execution could take place. This file shall be kept as evidence.
Conviction of Shiroyama: Signed: Kujou Sara
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? So Shiroyama's conviction was also signed by Kujou Sara... just like Ryuuji's!
(Read the Toxicology Report)
Toxicology Report: On the toxin that caused Takatsukasa Isamu's death:
Toxicology Report: An odorless, tasteless, and inert substance. Soluble in water, but insoluble in other substances. Has the properties of a synthetic toxin. It appears as a fine, white, powdery substance in its normal state. Tentative name: "white powder."
Toxicology Report: The station has investigated the ledgers of all domestic commerce guilds, no transaction record for such an item was found.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm, a synthetic toxin? What's that?

Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: What clue reveals the criminal's motive?
 Shiroyama's Testament
(−1 Heart)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Just Shiroyama's Testament? Though it does have the confession of his motives, this alone is not enough, he could have been lying.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: We need evidence to prove what he said is true. Perhaps you should give it some more thought...

 Conviction of Shiroyama

Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Although the conviction states that Shiroyama grew to resent Takatsukasa Isamu due to work conflicts, it's not detailed enough for us to understand the motive. Perhaps you should give it some more thought...

Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Excellent work! According to the victim's message, the two had deep conflicts. Although we cannot confirm whether the poison had been requested by the victim or not...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It is true that Isamu used Shiroyama's family to blackmail him. Such circumstances could be enough motive for Shiroyama to commit the crime.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: But... wasn't Takatsukasa Isamu good to Shiroyama? He even went to Shiroyama's house to bring health supplements...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: *gasp* But maybe he didn't really bring health supplements! Maybe it was something bad!?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 heizou 12.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Haha, is that what you think, Paimon? Well, we later found out that what Takatsukasa Isamu sent to Shiroyama's house was indeed health supplements.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 heizou 13.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But if you consider the circumstances, what he sent wasn't important. What was important is that sending the supplements was actually a dangerous signal...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 heizou 14.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Isamu was essentially implying, "I can put anything in your wife's supplements at any time. If you really care about her safety, then get me what I want."
Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ah! So scary! Your assumption sounds like a real threat! You're not really that dark inside... are you?

Media:vo lyycop001 1906004 heizou 16.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Basically, these two clues work to verify each other, and the murderer's motive is confirmed. Now all that's left is the means of the crime.

Media:vo lyycop001 1906005 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Was it mixed with the cold medicine, as Shiroyama stated in his testament? If so, we need some evidence to prove that. Perhaps you should give it some more thought...

 The Autopsy Report of Takatsukasa Isamu, Shiroyama's Testament, and the Toxicology Report
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906005 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Bingo! The autopsy report confirms that the cause of death was a special toxin. The testament indicates that Shiroyama used his position as a forensic expert to mix the toxin into the cold medicine taken by the deceased.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906005 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But is that really the truth? Is it not possible that the toxin was mixed into the fish-liver paste?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906005 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Well, according to the toxicology report, this "white powder" only dissolves in water. Neither rice nor the fish-liver paste could be used as a carrier of the toxin. The cold medicine was the only option.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906005 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Putting the poison elsewhere would not only fail to guarantee a lethal dose, but would also increase the chance of it being noticed by the deceased. Therefore, the means is also confirmed.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906005 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Add that to the motive for the crime, and... Whoa! So the murderer really was Shiroyama!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Yep, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Pretty clear-cut, wouldn't you say? Look, I really don't know what Sango is so suspicious about.

Things Clear Up[]

(Talk to Heizou after choosing the correct clue)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yeah, it's pretty clear-cut... Huh, you could say it's almost too clear-cut!
 Wait... I still have some questions.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Oh? Well, let's hear them. Maybe I have answers.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: What's bugging you?
 Why is the "Research Log from the Office of Forensic Science" blank? Did someone tear out some pages?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: This also puzzles me. Maybe someone doesn't want us being privy to the content inside, or maybe Shiroyama tore a bunch of pages out by accident.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But regardless, this isn't essential to the case. Like I said before, a lot of what comes up in an investigation is irrelevant information.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The crucial elements are Shiroyama's motive and means, which we have established.
(Dialogue returns to option selection if there are any left)
 The Toxicology Report mentioned that this poison isn't sold anywhere in Inazuma, but Shiroyama's Testament said that it was bought at the International Trade Association.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Maybe the report was wrong. The International Trade Association is a gathering place for merchants from all over. Countless merchants pass through the port of Ritou every day. It's natural for there to be a couple of missing records here or there.
(Dialogue returns to option selection if there are any left)
 Based on the "Convictions" written by Kujou Sara for Ryuuji and Shiroyama, the two committed the same crime. Why are their punishments different?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Haha, very nice. Top marks for attention to detail. It doesn't have any real bearing on the case, but let me explain how that works for you.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So, why would Madam Kujou Sara sign one conviction sentencing Ryuuji to temporary incarceration awaiting trial, and another conviction sentencing Shiroyama to death?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You may have heard some rumors back at the station that when this case first came up, the Kujou Clan higher-ups were in dire need of a scapegoat to keep the Takatsukasa Clan off their backs, and poor Ryuuji became the successful candidate.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: In less than a week, the conviction was drafted, sent to Madam Kujou Sara, and signed. Allegedly, she knew what it was about as soon as she saw it, and signed it with no questions asked.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 12.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But anyone who buys this story clearly doesn't know that much about Madam Kujou Sara. She's the most principled person in the entire Tenryou Commission, for goodness' sake.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 13.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So how would she respond to a case filled with unanswered questions and no confession from the suspect?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, you mean...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 14.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Exactly. Before she signed it, she changed Ryuuji's conviction from the death sentence to temporary incarceration.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 15.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Ryuuji escaped a disastrous fate without ever realizing it. Had Madam Kujou Sara not changed his sentence, Sango would have been seeking justice for a dead man.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Why was Sara so lenient with Ryuuji?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 16.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: That's the wrong question. This wasn't about Ryuuji, but Madam Kujou Sara's principles. The conviction could have been for a Ryuuji, a Guuji, and even a Tanuki, and she would have made the same decision.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 17.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Given the enormous pressure she was under at the time, I'd say she did the most she could, don't you think?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Pressure? Really, was someone higher up putting pressure on Sara?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 18.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The pressure came from all sides. The deceased was the leader of the Police Station and the rising star of the Takatsukasa Clan. All eyes were on this case.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 19.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: How this became reduced to the unimaginative rumor that Madam Kujou Sara convicted Ryuuji under pressure from her superiors, I have no idea.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Ugh, rumors here, conspiracy theories there... lies at every turn!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 20.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Fortunately, Madam Kujou Sara works in an open and transparent manner, and pays no heed to rumors like this. She just rolls her eyes and forgets all about them.
 How do you know?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 21.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Just because she has never publicly clarified the truth doesn't mean she was hiding anything. So when I asked her about it, saying it was relevant to a case I was working on, she just told me how it was.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 22.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Believe me, in this case more than any other, I have checked every last detail.
(Dialogue returns to option selection if there are any left)
(After asking all three questions)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 23.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Well, I've answered all your lingering questions, and you've checked all the material the Police Station has, so... what do you think, case closed?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Paimon still feels like something doesn't add up, but then again, Heizou did give us all the files the Police Station had... Ugh, this is annoying...
 We've seen everything... that the Police Station has. Now I see the problem.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 24.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Oh, I don't follow, enlighten me.
 At the detective agency, you told Sango: "I've disclosed everything the Police Station has on the case."
 When we started to look at the files, you said to us: "Everything laid out here is all that the Police Station has about the case."
 Just now, you said it again: "You've checked all the material the Police Station has."
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Right! Why do you keep emphasizing "Police Station" every single time?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 25.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You tell me. Why do I keep emphasizing "Police Station" every time?
 Because you're trying to hint that there is other information that the Police Station doesn't have.

Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 28.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You're absolutely right, there is other information that the Police Station doesn't have. Reason being... it's my own evidence. And this evidence should help answer a couple of your questions more clearly:
Media:vo lyycop001 1906006 heizou 29.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Why was the "Research Log from the Office of Forensic Science" blank, and where did the white powder come from?

(Opens Forensic Office Research Log Excerpt)
Acidic nutrients extracted from the Sunsettia were mixed with the oil extracted from the fish liver. When the mixture was purified, the formation of a fine, powdery substance was observed.

Over the course of a week, Forest Boars to whom this substance had been administered suffered first from damaged and diseased skin mucous membranes, followed by respiratory failure, then death.

The mixing and purification procedure was then repeated, but replacing the Sunsettia with concentrated Sunsettia juice and the fish liver with concetrated fish-liver paste. A large quantity of the powdery substance was produced.

When Forest Boars were administered this dose, the time of death was reduced from one week to a few hours.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Finished? Do you see now?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The method used by the perpetrator to commit his crime wasn't by putting the white powder in the cold medicine...
 He put it in the fish-liver paste!
(−1 Heart)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Wait what? Where'd you conjure up that answer from? Try again.
(Dialogue returns to option selection)
 The cold medicine and the fish-liver paste were mixed to form the white powder!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: That's correct! The white powder was Shiroyama's invention.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: As a forensic doctor, he provided a special cold medicine for Takatsukasa Isamu. The autopsy report showed that this medicine contained a high volume of acidic fruit and vegetable extracts.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Then, he tricked Ryuuji into sending fish-liver paste to Takatsukasa Isamu. When the two substances were taken together, a toxic dose of the substance formed in his body.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: This is the real modus operandi.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ohh, that's awful... One was medicine, and the other was an expensive nutritional supplement. Both completely harmless...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 12.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: True, both are harmless on their own, but when combined... Poof! That's it.
 Why didn't Shiroyama admit this in his testament? There was no need for him to hide it.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 13.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It was not him who wanted to hide it, but the person pulling the strings behind him.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? You mean there was someone else pulling the strings!?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 14.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Aren't you curious where I found these pages from the research log?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 15.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It was in Kujou Takayuki's secret warehouse.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 16.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: After I found the missing pages, I did some digging around and found out that Shiroyama had worked for Kujou Takayuki before joining the Police Station.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 17.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The Kujou Clan secretly provided Shiroyama with funds to study forensic science. I guess you could say that Kujou Takayuki's investment paid dividends in this case.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 18.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Of course, I only learned all of this after the Vision Hunt Decree came to an end. Kujou Takayuki had lost his grip on power, and the Tenryou Commission was undergoing a general reshuffle.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 19.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: To avoid coming under suspicion, Madam Kujou Sara put me in charge of building a case against Kujou Takayuki.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 20.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I found a huge stash of fish-liver paste in his secret warehouse... nothing hugely incriminating about that, of course, but I still took the trouble to open each and every package, until finally...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 21.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I had to concede that this really was just a huge stash of fish-liver paste.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 22.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But then... underneath the floor tiles where the fish-liver paste was stacked, I found a secret compartment with this torn-off research report lying inside.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So it was him who wanted to frame Ryuuji all along! What a nasty piece of work!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 23.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Let's review the whole case, from the top.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 24.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: First, Takatsukasa Isamu, for whatever reason, noticed Shiroyama's talent as a forensic doctor, and asked him to develop a special poison on his behalf. But Shiroyama was already working for the Kujou Clan, so he refused.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 25.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Takatsukasa Isamu wasn't about to take no for an answer, and that's where things took a dark turn: He twisted Shiroyama's arm by making a veiled threat to harm his family. All Shiroyama could do was to secretly report everything to Kujou Takayuki.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 26.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: When Takayuki learned what was happening, he instructed Shiroyama to pretend to cooperate with Takatsukasa Isamu, then kill the latter with the white powder once it was fully developed.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 27.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Meanwhile, Ryuuji's only role in this case was to deliver the fish-liver paste to Takatsukasa Isamu on Shiroyama's orders, completely unaware of the fact that he was being used as a pawn, and that this was a key ingredient needed to create the poison.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 28.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: After the incident, Kujou Takayuki hoped to make Ryuuji the fall guy, until the death sentence was stalled when it reached Madam Kujou Sara.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 29.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: In the meantime, Sango had begun her own investigation. Kujou Takayuki grew nervous that the truth would get out, so he threw Shiroyama to the wolves, hounding him to death and erasing all traces of contact between the two.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 30.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: And yet, he wanted to keep this secret formula, so he hid it. Greedy guy, that Takayuki... he must have wanted to have it on hand just in case he needed to employ it again in the future, and make someone else disappear...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: This Kujou Takayuki is an evil lunatic! We've gotta report this to Ei. Whatever his current punishment is, it needs to be 10 times worse!!!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 31.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: That would be practically impossible. One research log found in his warehouse doesn't prove anything, even I can think of a hundred excuses.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 32.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Besides... Ryuuji directly contributed to Takatsukasa Isamu's death by delivering the fish-liver paste to him. The fact that he was unaware of the true nature of the situation doesn't matter.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: But... but he's still innocent, right? Isn't it just a coincidence? ...Paimon really doesn't get how the law works.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 33.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Legally speaking, the judge would most likely rule that it was accidental. But in practice, Ryuuji may still have to end up shouldering some responsibility...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: So basically, you've been hiding the truth all this time to protect Ryuuji...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 34.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Mental trauma doesn't heal as easily as physical wounds... My biggest worry is that Ryuuji would struggle to cope if he knew the truth.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 35.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: He's like an innocent child... he freely gives his trust and his love to everyone that treats him well. That's why he thought of Takatsukasa Isamu as a father figure.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 36.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I'm pretty sure that to this day, he has never paused to wonder whether Takatsukasa Isamu was actually a good person, or if Sango just hired him as a gofer...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 37.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: ...Or why I left the detective agency.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 38.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: If he found out the facts about Takatsukasa Isamu, I'm afraid it would crush him...
 So... why are you revealing the truth to me today?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 39.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Haha, well, as you can see, I'm a little less confident than people might think.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 40.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: To prevent Ryuuji from getting hurt, I covered up the truth. But by doing so, have I held him back?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 41.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Did I do the right thing? I couldn't turn to anyone for help, and everyone around me thinks I'm so smart, that I should just be able to handle every case on my own.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 42.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Even if I tried to discuss it with them, they'd just say: "Don't be ridiculous, Mr. Heizou, no problem's too difficult for you!"
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 43.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But you're different, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Unlike them, you don't have that kind of prejudice towards me.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 44.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You've traveled far and wide, and had all kinds of experiences. It must have taught you a lot.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 45.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Most importantly... my intuition tells me that you're someone special. I can trust you, and you can help me... right?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 46.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So, I'd like you to be the one to decide whether we should expose the truth or not.
 I need to think about that...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 47.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Oh... you don't need to tell me what you decide, and you certainly don't need to decide right now. Let's just say, I'm leaving this "teensy-tiny" matter up to you.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906007 heizou 48.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Alright, let's get back to the detective agency. You can mull it over on the way. Once you've made up your mind, just tell Ryuuji and Sango your verdict.

Your Answer[]

(Talk to Ryuuji)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 ryuji 01.ogg Ryuuji: Hey, Traveler! Hey, Detective Heizou!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 ryuji 02.ogg Ryuuji: You're back already, huh? Hehe, I bet you're tired! Well, I just bought some Tonkatsu. Care to join me? There's plenty for everyone!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We'd love to... but wouldn't you like to hear the results of our investigation first?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 ryuji 03.ogg Ryuuji: No matter what you were able to find, it's all in the past and won't ever change. So I think we'd better chow down first!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 ryuji 04.ogg Ryuuji: Besides, if Sango's not happy with the results, we might not have anything to eat later...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 sango 01.ogg Sango: C'mon Ryuuji, pipe down! Let's hear the Traveler's conclusion first.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Uhh, okay then... Over to you, Heizou and (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), don't worry, just tell us your findings. Everyone trusts you, as do I.
 Sango was wrong about Heizou, and the murderer was indeed Shiroyama.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 ryuji 05.ogg Ryuuji: Well, whaddya know. I suspected that was the case... *sigh* Please rest in peace, Master Takatsukasa...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 sango 02.ogg Sango: No! Impossible! Traveler, are you sure you checked every last file? Carefully?
 Trust me, I did.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hehehe.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 sango 03.ogg Sango: Ugh, no... you little... Shikanoin Heizou! You didn't pull any shenanigans on the Traveler, did you!?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 ryuji 06.ogg Ryuuji: Sango... no accusations without evidence, remember...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The truth is out and the case is closed, Sango. Please don't send any more of your harassment letters to the Tenryou Commission.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 heizou 04a.ogg Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 heizou 04b.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Well, I really owe it to you Traveler, I'll be sure to properly thank you later. Until then, see you!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 sango 04.ogg Sango: Hey! You're not going anywhere!
(Proceed to Ending: There's One Secret)
 Detective Heizou hid some evidence, the truth of the matter is...
You tell them the whole truth about the Ryuuji Case.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 sango 05.ogg Sango: But how... how could this be!?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 ryuji 07.ogg Ryuuji: Huh... So that's what really happened?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Ryuuji... I know it's hard to accept, but...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 ryuji 08.ogg Ryuuji: Wait a minute, sorry, I...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 ryuji 09.ogg Ryuuji: I have quite the stomachache... Sango, can I take the day off?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 sango 06.ogg Sango: Sure, of course... Take the week if you need it!
Ryuuji runs away in a fluster.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon hopes Ryuuji will be okay...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 sango 07.ogg Sango: I... didn't expect things to turn out like this.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Just give him some time to himself, I think he will eventually come to accept it.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 sango 08.ogg Sango: I'm still a little worried though, what if he doesn't come to work tomorrow...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906008 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Then we'll go to him. Don't you worry about that, Sango. You need some time to process all of this too.
(Dialogue continues below)
(Talk to Sango again)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906013 sango 01.ogg Sango: I am at a loss for words right now... please, just leave me be.

(Wait until the following day (08:00–12:00))
(Talk to Sango)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906011 sango 01.ogg Sango: Ah, you're here. Don't worry, Ryuuji came earlier this morning.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906011 sango 02.ogg Sango: I guess he can handle a lot more than I had thought. I was honestly worried he'd suffer a breakdown.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906011 sango 03.ogg Sango: But as of today, it seems he'll be fine.
 Is he not here?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906011 sango 04.ogg Sango: He went over to Netsuke no Gen Crafts to buy something...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906011 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Let's go find him then, shall we?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906011 sango 05.ogg Sango: Before you go... Heizou, I uh... I kind of understand now what you meant when you left.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906011 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Oh, really? I'm happy to hear you say that.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906011 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Haha, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Alright, time to find Ryuuji.
(Talk to Sango again)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906014 sango 01.ogg Sango: Wait, aren't you going to see Ryuuji?
 What did Heizou say to you when he left the agency?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906014 sango 02.ogg Sango: Hah, now that I think about it, it's like a slap in the face...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906014 sango 03.ogg Sango: He said, "Some things will always be more important than the truth."

(Approach Ryuuji at Netsuke no Gen Crafts)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906015 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Look! There's Ryuuji, with a little kid, too! Hmm? Is he buying her toys?
(Talk to Ryuuji and Takatsukasa Chika)
Media:vo lyycop001 1906012 takatsukasachika 01.ogg Takatsukasa Chika: Uncle Ryuuji, was my daddy handsome? I've never seen what he looked like.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906012 ryuji 01.ogg Ryuuji: Of course, Takatsukasa Isamu was a very handsome man. Also, it's not "uncle." Call me brother.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906012 takatsukasachika 02.ogg Takatsukasa Chika: But you look so old.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906012 ryuji 02.ogg Ryuuji: Well, I'm still your brother.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906012 takatsukasachika 03.ogg Takatsukasa Chika: Huh? How come?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906012 ryuji 03.ogg Ryuuji: Because he treated me like a son.
 Ahem...
Media:vo lyycop001 1906012 takatsukasachika 04.ogg Takatsukasa Chika: Huh? Who are you guys?
Media:vo lyycop001 1906012 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: We're friends with your big brother, Ryuuji, and with your father, too.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906012 takatsukasachika 05.ogg Takatsukasa Chika: Oh, really? Yay! I've met loads of my daddy's friends today. Can you tell me some stories about him? I really wanna hear them.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906012 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hehe, sure! Why, I know enough stories about your old man that if I started talking now, you'd be all grown-up before I finished them.
Media:vo lyycop001 1906012 takatsukasachika 06.ogg Takatsukasa Chika: Wow! That's amazing! Well, I don't wanna grow up too soon then... Maybe when I'm 100... no, no, 200 years old... Umm, no, 300 years old!
Media:vo lyycop001 1906012 takatsukasachika 07.ogg Takatsukasa Chika: Yep! I'm gonna wait until I'm 300 years old before I become a grown-up, so that I can make sure I finish all the stories first!

Greeting Gift[]

(Go to Mingxing Jewelery to collect the item)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Hello, I'm here to collect the item I handed in for repair.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 xingxi 01.ogg Xingxi: Ah, Lady Ningguang. One moment please, I'll fetch it immediately.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Very good. Don't rush, now. Please handle it with care.
 Is it something very valuable?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: Hmm... Yes and no.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: You probably imagine that Mingxing Jewelry deals exclusively in expensive luxury goods.
 True, that's my impression.
 Actually, not exclusively.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: The workers here are very skilled, so I like to come to them when I need something custom-made.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: This time, though, I just had them do a simple repair. The item is quite ordinary. In fact, the cost of the repair was more than the item was ever worth.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 xingxi 02.ogg Xingxi: Lady Ningguang. Your comb has been fixed. Please inspect it and see whether you're satisfied with our work.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 xingxi 03.ogg Xingxi: We did everything we could to restore it to its original condition. You'll still see a few marks on there, though. This was unavoidable because of how badly damaged the item was.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: That's fine. Thank you for your hard work.
 You were right about it being a little ordinary.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Yes, though it is something very precious to one of my informants. It reminds her of her mother.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: My informants often provide me with extremely important information. It's only fair that I endeavor to meet any requests they have in return.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: Trust is of far greater importance than profit in the relationship between me and my informants.
 I thought useful intel could only be bought with Mora.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: It's understandable to think that way. And in the vast majority of cases, you'd be completely right.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: But things are a little different with these particular informants. Mora doesn't get you very far with this crowd...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: And this only makes me all the more excited to meet with them.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: Thank you for the repair, Xingxi. This is a great help.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 xingxi 04.ogg Xingxi: Oh, don't mention it. It's always a pleasure, Lady Ningguang.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913301 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: Let's go and meet them.
(Obtain  Repaired Comb)
(Talk to Xingxi again)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 xingxi 01.ogg Xingxi: Take care, both of you. Please come again!

Exchanging Intelligence[]

(Meet the informants)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 zhizhi 01.ogg Zhizhi: Aunty Ningguang!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 littlelong 01.ogg Little Long: Hi, Aunty Ningguang!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Hello my dears! It's been a long time, hasn't it?
 The informants are... children?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Yes indeed. And they are some of my most reliable helpers and friends.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: I didn't want to involve them in intelligence gathering for me at first, but they, on the other hand, were so enthusiastic about the idea that I thought it couldn't hurt to try. I treated it as a little game between us.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: It turned out that they delivered the goods and thoroughly enjoyed themselves while they were at it. So, it was a win-win.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: So! Fill me in, how have you all been doing?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 littlelong 02.ogg Little Long: Great! Mom and Dad have taken me on loads of cool trips recently. It's been loadsa fun!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 zhizhi 02.ogg Zhizhi: But... you didn't do your homework, did you...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 littlelong 03.ogg Little Long: Yeah, but... it's not my fault.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 zhizhi 03.ogg Zhizhi: You still gotta try. Like teacher says, Liyue Harbor is in a new age now, and we've got a really important part to play.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: This new age started after that great battle, you know.
 I didn't know it would have such a profound impact.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: Well, this is a dramatic change, unique in all of the millennia of Liyue's history. Everyone is eager to do their part and make their mark in the age of humanity.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: What about you, Nannan? You haven't said anything yet, and you're looking a little unhappy.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 01.ogg Nannan: I... I'm fine... Um... Just dunno what to say.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 littlelong 04.ogg Little Long: Oh yeah, I just remembered! A load of really big boats came into the harbor the day before yesterday!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 zhizhi 04.ogg Zhizhi: Yeah, that's right! All the merchants were there and it was really noisy, and then the people on the boat started unloading all these crates. There was a salty, kinda fishy smell in the air.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: Oh, I see. That'll be the fishing boats coming back from the open ocean. How much cargo were they carrying? Remember, I taught you how you can tell.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 littlelong 05.ogg Little Long: Yep! I made sure to look at the waterline, just like you said. They looked really full this time!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: My goodness! Well, it sounds like they made quite a big catch.
 How can you tell?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: The heavier the boat, the lower the hull sits in the water. So you can tell how heavily loaded a vessel is from the height of the waterline.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: How deep a fully loaded vessel will sit in the water varies from ship to ship. But it's something you can tell from experience, at least for the kinds of vessels you see regularly.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 littlelong 06.ogg Little Long: Hee-hee, since Aunty Ningguang taught me how to do it, I can tell with just one look!
 Very clever!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 02.ogg Nannan: Um, a few days ago, I heard some people saying that a big merchant from Fontaine is coming soon to buy Luminescent Spines.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 03.ogg Nannan: They said that when they get here... the price will go up a lot.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: Oh, really?
 (That's the opposite of what Ningguang's analysis found out...)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: Who did you hear this from? Do you remember what they looked like?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 04.ogg Nannan: Um... no, I don't remember...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: Alright, never mind. So how about what they said — do you remember their exact words?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 05.ogg Nannan: Um... um, I don't remember that either. Sorry...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 littlelong 07.ogg Little Long: Are you okay? You're usually the one that talks the most. What's gotten into you today?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 16.ogg Ningguang: It's okay, don't be upset. Actually, I brought you a little something to cheer you up. How about that, hmm?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 06.ogg Nannan: It's... my comb! You remembered!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 17.ogg Ningguang: Of course I did. If I make you a promise, I will always keep it.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 07.ogg Nannan: Thank you, Aunty Ningguang. Thank you so much...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 18.ogg Ningguang: It was just a small favor, really. Nothing to get overexcited about.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 08.ogg Nannan: But... but they said you'd be too busy to remember about a boring old comb.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 19.ogg Ningguang: "They"?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 09.ogg Nannan: Uh oh...
 (It looks like there's a story here.)
 (No wonder she was fumbling her words.)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 20.ogg Ningguang: It's alright, don't worry. There just seems to be some kind of misunderstanding here. Why don't you take this opportunity to clear it up? Don't you think that'd be best?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 zhizhi 05.ogg Zhizhi: Yeah! Aunty Ningguang's not gonna blame you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 10.ogg Nannan: I'm sorry, I—I... I told you a lie...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 11.ogg Nannan: That thing about the Luminescent Spines wasn't something I heard. Um, two people came and told me to say it to you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 12.ogg Nannan: I told them I didn't wanna lie to Aunty Ningguang, but, um, they told me you'd forgotten all about the comb, and I didn't know how to argue with them...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 13.ogg Nannan: Then they bought me a new comb, and, and I...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 14.ogg Nannan: I'm sorry! I'll give them the comb back right away! No comb is better than the one you helped get fixed for me!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 21.ogg Ningguang: I know how much it means to you. It was a gift from your mom before she left Liyue Harbor, wasn't it?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 15.ogg Nannan: Yep, it was! I'll be extra careful with it from now on. When mom gets back, she'll be so sad if she finds out I broke it...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 22.ogg Ningguang: I must say, this is most intriguing...
 It looks like someone is trying to scam you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 23.ogg Ningguang: How about this: You tell me where those two people are, and I'll take the comb back to them for you. Sound good?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 nannan 16.ogg Nannan: Okay... um, they're over at the docks. They said I should go and meet them when I've finished the mission...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 24.ogg Ningguang: Alright then. Don't worry, it'll all be fine. I'll be right back.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 littlelong 08.ogg Little Long: Are you gonna go punish the bad guys?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 25.ogg Ningguang: Now now, this is a grown-up situation, okay? It's not fun and games anymore. And don't try and follow me.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913302 ningguang 26.ogg Ningguang: I'm just going to have a polite discussion with those two grown-ups about what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do.
(Talk to Little Long again)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 littlelong 01.ogg Little Long: If you'd told us sooner, we would've figured out that it's a lie.
(Talk to Zhizhi again)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 zhizhi 01.ogg Zhizhi: Yeah. All three of us together makes a pretty smart group!
(Talk to Nannan again)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 nannan 01.ogg Nannan: I got it, thanks...

(Go to the south wharf to meet the person behind the scenes)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 xu 01.ogg Big Xu: Don't you think that kid's gonna fluff her lines? Also... let's be honest, this is, uh, a new low for us...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 01.ogg Lao Ke: Ugh, yes, I know... but we didn't have any other options. Just try not to overthink it, okay? Nannan's one of Ningguang's most trusted informants.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 02.ogg Lao Ke: Ningguang adores that kid. She's not gonna get all suspicious just because her story doesn't quite add up.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: It sounds like you underestimated me. And the children, as well.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 03.ogg Lao Ke: L—Lady Ningguang!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: You knew how important that comb was to Nannan, and you exploited that fact to emotionally manipulate her.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: You coached a child to lie, made her betray her own innocence and confuse her conscience. Do you not realize how contemptible that is?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 04.ogg Lao Ke: I... Uh...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 xu 02.ogg Big Xu: Sorry, Lady Ningguang! We... we never should have crossed you like this!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: That's not the point. Business is business, and at some point we're all trying to get the better of one another. So if all you'd done is fool me by feeding me false information, I'd make a loss and that would be the end of it.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: But you cannot put Mora above all else. You cannot go exploiting children for profit. Do you have any idea just how much damage that will cause?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 05.ogg Lao Ke: It was hardly our first choice either... We were only acting out of necessity.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 06.ogg Lao Ke: We've been business partners for years now. We've gotten by, I guess, but never had any opportunities to expand.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 07.ogg Lao Ke: When we heard about the movement in the Luminescent Spine market, we thought to heck with it. Let's go all in on this one, see if we don't get lucky for once.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 08.ogg Lao Ke: So we stocked up a huge stash of Luminescent Spines and watched as the price went up and up. We thought, this was gonna be it. We were gonna make our fortune.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 xu 03.ogg Big Xu: But we waited and waited and this mystery merchant from Fontaine never came. More and more people started to suspect it was all a huge scam.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 xu 04.ogg Big Xu: Suddenly, everyone with Luminescent Spines was running for the exit, selling as fast as they could. But we had so much inventory that no one was willing to buy it...
 And that's when you thought of Ningguang?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 09.ogg Lao Ke: Well, yeah. As soon as Lady Ningguang makes a move, everyone follows her lead, and the price takes a steep hike...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 10.ogg Lao Ke: If we don't sell the goods, we're both bankrupt. We're in debt up to our eyeballs! We just didn't have any other choices...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: To be brutally honest, "We took out a loan and made a speculative investment" is not a sob story.
 Your business analysis was correct.
 This supports your conclusion about the Luminescent Spine hype.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: But not everyone has the capability to make rational decisions.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Greed, a lust for wealth, and impatience can all cloud your judgment.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: Do you now realize how dire the consequences of wild speculation can be?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 11.ogg Lao Ke: A hundred percent. We've both barely slept in days.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 12.ogg Lao Ke: We begged people to take our stock off our hands... They laughed at us, called us idiots, thought it was all hilarious...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 xu 05.ogg Big Xu: We messed up. Completely and catastrophically messed up...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 xu 06.ogg Big Xu: The savings we worked so hard our whole lives to build up, decimated just like that. All we want now is a chance to start over.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: Hmm... Well, I can take your Luminescent Spines off your hands. But we will need a detailed contract.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: The portion of what I pay that exceeds the average price of Luminescent Spines in the past, you will need to pay back to me by some means in our future business dealings.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 13.ogg Lao Ke: Huh? But... but that means our profit is zero...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: Then you're free to find another willing buyer.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: But if you're seriously still insisting on turning a profit under these circumstances, I'm afraid you're beyond redemption.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 xu 07.ogg Big Xu: Lady Ningguang is right. Let's swap the goods for cash and use it to pay off our debts, and be done with it. This is a lifeline, and we should be grateful for it. Forget about making money.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 14.ogg Lao Ke: Yes, yes, you're right...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: I have no particular need for Luminescent Spines, but I'm quite sure I can uncover a market for it with a little research.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 15.ogg Lao Ke: Okay, so, uh... shall we get this deal done now, or...?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: No need to hurry. Our deal is hardly the urgent matter here. Atoning for your transgressions is the main order of business.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 16.ogg Ningguang: You took advantage of a child, and you are coming with me to make a full and unreserved apology.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 17.ogg Ningguang: This is an opportunity for you to show remorse.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 oldke 16.ogg Lao Ke: O—Okay...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913303 ningguang 18.ogg Ningguang: Come on, let's go back and see the children.

Principles[]

(Go see the children)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: We're back. Everything's all sorted.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 nannan 01.ogg Nannan: Huh? Oh, it's those two...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 oldke 01.ogg Lao Ke: ...I'm sorry, Nannan. I was lying to you when I told you that Lady Ningguang wouldn't fix your comb.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 oldke 02.ogg Lao Ke: I was completely in the wrong, and I promise I'll never do anything like this again. Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 nannan 02.ogg Nannan: Hmmmm... What do you think, Aunty Ningguang?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: I think it should be your choice, and yours alone.
 No matter what your decision is, we support you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 nannan 03.ogg Nannan: Well...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 zhizhi 01.ogg Zhizhi: Since it's all sorted now, and nothing super bad happened, I guess it's okay.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 littlelong 01.ogg Little Long: But we can't just let them off. We gotta show them you don't mess with us!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: That's true. I'd certainly hate to see anyone else try to con you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 nannan 04.ogg Nannan: I've made up my mind.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 oldke 03.ogg Lao Ke: ...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 nannan 05.ogg Nannan: I want them to come play with us.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 oldke 04.ogg Lao Ke: ...Uh, what?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 littlelong 02.ogg Little Long: Yay! Now we have someone to play hide-and-seek with!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 zhizhi 02.ogg Zhizhi: Great idea! Let's go play hide-and-seek at the North Wharf!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 oldke 05.ogg Lao Ke: W—Wait a second...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 littlelong 03.ogg Little Long: Nope, no waiting! C'mon!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: Hehe, so full of energy.
 We should go with them.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913304 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: Yes, of course. I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving them alone with those two buffoons.

(Play with the children at the north wharf)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Let me guess what you're thinking.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: You're thinking that there's not a huge difference between me turning these children into my informants and the actions of those two businessmen. Am I right?
 You got me.
 I mean, it's not AS bad, but...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: They were completely different when I first met them.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: They'd run away as soon as they saw me, or they'd be shaking with nerves and unable to speak.
 You are Lady Ningguang, after all.
 I'd be nervous, too.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: But gradually, they stopped seeing me as someone to be afraid of, and started seeing me as someone they can trust.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: For my part, I did my utmost to fulfill the duties of a responsible adult.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: I played games with them, but I also taught them observation skills, analytical skills, how to think critically. I never taught business, though.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Now, they're much further ahead in their studies and far more mature than their peers. This has given them confidence in themselves.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: I think that this is beneficial to them.
 You are a lot like a teacher to them.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: Yes, perhaps I am.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: I never had the chance to receive a good education as a child. That's why I hope to teach these children myself. Hopefully I can pass on some of what I have learned.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: Someday, they may realize that not everything is a win-win deal, that deception and one-upmanship are facts of life. But there's nothing wrong with that.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: When that happens, they will be ready to face the world head-on and become exceptional businessmen and women. But until then, I am here to protect them.
 Are you raising them to be your heirs?
 Are you raising them to be your competitors?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: I will one day die, new Qixing will replace the old, and Liyue will continue to prosper.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: I hope the name, Ningguang, will live on, but not as a person. As more of a symbol.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 16.ogg Ningguang: If I can pass on everything I have learned, I can create a legacy that will live on long after I am gone.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 littlelong 01.ogg Little Long: Come on, Aunty Ningguang! Hurry up!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 nannan 01.ogg Nannan: We're not gonna wait forever~!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 17.ogg Ningguang: Coming!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913305 ningguang 18.ogg Ningguang: Come on, let's enjoy this while we can.

 Quest DescriptionTo help Gorou exorcise his fears, you play the roles of people he is not good at dealinig with. However...

(Go to Ritou)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: So this is Ritou.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Although it looks slightly gloomy, it feels very peaceful here. I don't see any Tenryou Commission soldiers roaming the streets... What a nice place.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: Okay, let's get started! I'll be me, and you be a shrewd and savvy businesswoman.
 Oh, it's you. You came all this way to see me?
 Welcome to Tsukumomono Groceries, we've got everything you need...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Hi, so... a lot of the soldiers have been complaining about a shortage of blankets recently.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: So, uh... ten blankets, please.
 20,000 Mora.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: Okay, I'll settle the check right away...
 That's it? Just like that?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: The price seems pretty cheap to me. In which case, no need to haggle, right?
 200,000 Mora, then.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: I think that's still not too bad... Is that supposed to be really expensive?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: I'm sorry, in the past, Her Excellency has always handled procurement of military supplies.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: I don't know the specific prices of these items, so I never really know how to respond...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: This won't get us anywhere. I have to haggle to give you the chance to use your wily tricks on me. What do we do now?
 Let's switch to something that you're more interested in.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: Something I'm more interested in? Hmm...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: Maybe, um... cake?
 100,000 Mora for a slice of cake.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: That's so expensive! I know what a fair price is when it comes to cake!
 If you want to bargain, you'll have to do as I say.
 If you can do one little thing for me...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 15.ogg Gorou: Wait a sec, if you think about this from another angle...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 16.ogg Gorou: A cake that costs 100,000 Mora per slice must be so much better than a regular cake!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 17.ogg Gorou: Lemme see, I've been saving up recently — I think I should have enough...
 ???
 Hold on.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 18.ogg Gorou: So... there isn't really a kind of cake that costs 100,000 Mora per slice?
 I really don't think so...
 I... don't know...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 19.ogg Gorou: What a shame.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 20.ogg Gorou: I feel like role-playing as a vendor is a little outside our area of expertise. Hmm, what kind of person do we both see regularly enough to impersonate convincingly?
 I think I've met Fatui with the right kind of personality...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 21.ogg Gorou: Fatui? Then it looks like a trip into the wild is in order.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902001 gorou 22.ogg Gorou: Let's go give it a try!

(Go to the wilds of Narukami Island where the Fatui are)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902002 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: I've dealt with Fatui before, but I always end up against those big stocky guys who are much taller than me.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902002 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: I'm sure I must train just as hard as they do every day, but somehow, I still don't have the muscles to show for it. Maybe I'll start to see the results in a few more years.
 I can't wait to see that.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902002 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: Right? Haha... I mean, at the very least, I need to look more muscular than my subordinates.
 I like you just the way you are.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902002 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Really? That's very kind. But still, I think that I should aim to look more muscular than my subordinates at the very least.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902002 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: I know that people's trust in me has nothing to do with my size, but if I were taller and bulkier, they'd be able to identify me from behind more easily when charging into battle.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902002 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: That way, our forces wouldn't scatter so easily. As long as I was on the field, they'd be able to follow me.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902002 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: Ah, enough of that. Let's get back to it! Who are you going to role-play as this time?
 The more, the merrier!
 Are you... here to play with me?
 Let me amuse myself a little...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902002 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: What!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902002 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: I smell danger!
 Hehe, it's just me.
 Looks like I was pretty convincing.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902002 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: Really? Huh, for a moment there, I could have sworn the actual Fatui were right here...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902002 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: No, wait (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)... behind you!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902002 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: It wasn't my imagination, they really are here. Prepare to engage!
(Defeat the attacking Fatui)

(After the battle)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902003 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: It's all fun and games until the real Fatui show up, huh...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902003 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: That little interruption has really ruined the mood for me. Let's not do any more Fatui impressions for today.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902003 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: It seems in poor taste after the trouble they caused in Watatsumi Island, anyway... Do we have any other options?
 There's only one thing for it.
 Time for plan Z.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902003 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Hmm. What do you mean...?
 Let's cut to the chase!
 I'll imitate the person you fear the most.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902003 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: !!!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902003 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: I—Isn't this moving a little too fast?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902003 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: Her Excellency advocates slow and steady progress in all things, and cautions against trying to advance too quickly.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902003 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: To clarify, it's not that I'm scared, it's just that I don't know if the time is right...
 Be brave and give it a try.
 It's time to take this step.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902003 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: ...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902003 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: I guess you're right. Thanks for your encouragement, it's not like me to shy away from a challenge like this.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902003 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Let's do it — time for a make-or-break training exercise!

That Didn't Work?[]

(Hit the Inazuma City streets)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: And we're back.
 Ready?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Don't worry. My head's in the game this time.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: I am a high-ranking military officer of Watatsumi Island and the general of the resistance. Whatever tricks you've got up your sleeve, you're not going to get to me.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: So bring it on!
 It sounds like you won't mind if I don't go easy on you?
 How adorable.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: This feels like...
 Let's see that gorgeous tail!
 Go on, let me rub your ears!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: Yes, it definitely feels like...
 Like Yae Miko?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: No, not even slightly.
 ???
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: It's not that you do a bad impression of her. More like... something is missing.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: I finally realized it when you were talking to me just now. I think that maybe what I'm really afraid of is her knowing smile and her piercing gaze.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: It just makes me feel like all my secrets have nowhere to hide, like she can just peer in and see them. But it's different with you. I trust you, so I don't feel I need to hide my secrets in the first place.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Even when you're imitating the way she speaks, I don't feel afraid. Because we've fought side by side in the past, and I know I don't have to have my guard up around you.
 That makes sense...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: *sigh*... But it also means that this training won't work.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: I just have to accept that this is a weakness of mine, as much as it pains me to do so.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: The thought of having to live with this weakness forever is frustrating...
 Why don't we go buy some cake?
 Surely some cake will cheer you up.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 15.ogg Gorou: Are you serious? I'd love that!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 16.ogg Gorou: I haven't eaten anything sweet in a long time...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 17.ogg Gorou: Off we go! Let's go buy some cake!
You go to buy some cake together with Gorou
Media:vo wlcop001 1902004 gorou 18.ogg Gorou: Alright! The next step is to find somewhere nice and quiet...

 Step DescriptionThe training hasn't been all that successful, but having some cake with Gorou is pretty alright too!

(Go to the spot)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902005 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Mmm... mmm... this is so good!
 You don't get to eat cake very often?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902005 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: It's certainly a rarity in the camp.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902005 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: It's seen as a luxury item in the ranks of the resistance... we have special meals on occasion, but even then, it usually means meat and wine — not dessert.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902005 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: So, thank you for treating me to some cake.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902005 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: The only downside with Narukami Island's pastries is that they're such exquisite things, you can't just chow down on them.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902005 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: But as Her Excellency says, a general needs to show patience and restraint...
 Want to try my cake?
 I don't mind sharing it if you want some.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902005 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: Wow, uh... d—don't mind if I do!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902005 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: It's so sweet...

Special Care[]

(Talk to Thoma before taking photos)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 23.ogg Thoma: Ahh, they're so cute... Come on, let's take some photos, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).

(Talk to Thoma)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Well, I think we've got enough photos now.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: I can't get over how cute they are! They're just adorable, aren't they, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 They're super cute.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: I'll have to think carefully about what kind of sweaters to knit for each of them.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: The colors should be complementary... Hmm... Well you know what? Let's buy some yarn from the next store we pass.
 They're a pain in the butt.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Haha, you mean because they won't keep still?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: In their defense, they've not really had proper training. It's natural for them to want to move around.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: You know, the first time I came here, there was just one stray dog on its own.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: I still remember the first time I fed it. It was a rainy day.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: The Kamisato Clan had just introduced a series of new policies, but a few of the more stubborn clan elders were extremely resistant to the changes.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: I was holding my umbrella, on my way to visit one such gentleman of senior status. The plan was to talk him into supporting the clan's decision.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Sadly, he wasn't interested in having a conversation — he didn't even let me in. As soon as he saw me coming, he got his samurai to send me away.
 Some things even Thoma can't fix, huh?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: I mean, I fixed it in the end of course. It's just that the first few visits didn't go so smoothly.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: So anyway, after they turned me away, the weather went from bad to worse. The wind was so strong it rendered my umbrella completely useless... Before long, I was drenched from head to toe — I must have looked like a real mess.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: I decided to take shelter under a tree, and found a stray dog sitting there who had the same idea as me.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: It saw me and moved a little further in, like it was trying to make room for me.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: So, we sat there together. I shared my Onigiri with it — stone cold by this point, but still edible — and we ended up huddling together, waiting for the rain to stop.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 17.ogg Thoma: As far as the big shots are concerned, I'm just an expendable servant boy. I always have to be mindful about what they might want, and what I can do for them in return.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 18.ogg Thoma: But when I'm with these little guys and gals, everything's so much simpler. One stone-cold Onigiri, and hey presto. We're friends for life.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 19.ogg Thoma: Even when I show up empty-handed, they still come to me. When it comes down to it, I think it's these simple and straightforward connections that I value the most.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 20.ogg Thoma: Sorry, ended up giving you the unabridged version! Shall we come visit this place again some other time?
 Yep, see you next time!
 As soon as you've done your knitting!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 21.ogg Thoma: Great. I'll see you soon!

(Dress the stray cats and dogs in sweaters with Thoma)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: *yawn* So sleepy...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: I had some things I needed to do, so I ended up burning the midnight oil to get those sweaters knitted.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: I wonder if they'll actually suit them though... Hmm, let's start by testing them out on the friendlier ones, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: This one's for Petal, this one's for Darko, and this one's for Goldilocks...
You dress the stray cats and dogs in sweaters with Thoma.
 Most of them look great.
 Nice job.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: With any luck, that should see them through the winter.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Then, come the spring, a new year will begin...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: ...and they'll be free to roam the wilds once again.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: You know, if you take one day at a time and be kind to the world, good things will come your way eventually.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: That might sound a bit naive, but I really do believe it.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: At least... it seems to have worked for me, you know?

Guest From Afar[]
 Quest DescriptionYou and Noelle met a strange guest near Mondstadt named Alois. Alois claims to be a merchant who has lost his cargo due to a monster attack. Noelle decides to bring Alois to Mondstadt to help him find his lost goods...

(Approach the gate)
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 swan 01.ogg Swan: Aha, Honorary Knight and Noelle. Were you two out on a mission?
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 swan 02.ogg Swan: Wait, who is this person behind you?
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 alois 01.ogg Alois: I... My name is Alois. I'm a humble merchant.
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 swan 03.ogg Swan: Ah, Mondstadt welcomes you, strange yet respectable traveler.
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 swan 04.ogg Swan: Please state your identity and purpose. The Knights of Favonius are here to ensure your safety.
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 alois 02.ogg Alois: Uh... ahem... I came to Mondstadt to import wines back to Liyue...
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 swan 05.ogg Swan: I see, but are you not carrying any luggage or goods?
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 swan 06.ogg Swan: I also don't see your name among the wine merchants that Mondstadt regularly deals with...
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 alois 03.ogg Alois: I... It's my first time visiting Mondstadt, but I expect to come back often...
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 swan 07.ogg Swan: Hmm... In that case, please show me the relevant documents issued by Liyue's Ministry of Civil Affairs. I need to verify your identity.
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 alois 04.ogg Alois: Huh? What on earth is the Min— ...Oh! Right, right, I... put them in my luggage!
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 swan 08.ogg Swan: ...Luggage?
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Oh, our apologies... This gentleman was just attacked by a monster and lost both his luggage and his goods.
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Could you allow him to calm down a bit before we register him with the Knights?
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 swan 09.ogg Swan: Hmm, according to Article 10 of the Knights of Favonius Handbook, caution should be exercised with regard to unfamiliar visitors.
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: But Article 2 of the Knights of Favonius Handbook also says that one must not offend our visitors, right?
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 swan 10.ogg Swan: Mmm, well... In this situation... umm...
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 swan 11.ogg Swan: ...I—It seems the Knights of Favonius Handbook has a bit of an overlap...
 I'll keep an eye on him. Nothing bad will happen.
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 swan 12.ogg Swan: Well... if you are keeping watch, there shouldn't be a problem...
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: After all, this is our Honorary Knight, the one who defended Mondstadt from the claws of the frenzied Stormterror.
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 alois 05.ogg Alois: Storm... terror?
 Many times your height, without jumping.
 He's a little fellow, not worth worrying about.
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 alois 06.ogg Alois: Haha... indeed... good one...
 Leave it to Noelle. She can take care of the situation.
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 swan 13.ogg Swan: Hmm... if Noelle is willing to vouch for him, then I can rest easy.
 After all, she is the most reliable maid in all Mondstadt.
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: I'm... just doing my job...
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: "Most reliable"? I've got a way to go, but I will try to live up to that!
 I'll be there too.
Media:vo noecop001 1906201 swan 14.ogg Swan: Well then, I'm counting on you two to take care of this gentleman while he's in Mondstadt.


 Quest DescriptionTo display Mondstadt's hospitality to guests, Noelle is working hard and making preparations.

(After the cutscene)
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: So you're a wine merchant? You must have excellent wine knowledge.
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Would you like to rest awhile at Angel's Share? It's our signature tavern.
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 alois 01.ogg Alois: Such a... warm welcome... how could I refuse?
(Approach Angel's Share)
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 alois 02.ogg Alois: Ah... Angel's Share. So this barrel must be full with Mondstadt's celebrated wine, right? If only it could be imitated...
 "Imitated"?
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 alois 03.ogg Alois: Oh, uh... imported! That's the word.
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Sorry to keep you waiting. Drink up!
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: This is a Dandelion Wine-based cocktail — I asked the bartender to add Calla Lily because it has a calming effect.
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: I know you've been on the road for a long time and cold drinks would be bad for your stomach.
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: So I requested less ice. Hope it's to your liking.
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 alois 04.ogg Alois: Calming?
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 alois 05.ogg Alois: Is this what they give to all visitors in Mondstadt?
 ...Made especially for you.
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 alois 06.ogg Alois: Hehe... because you know I'm interested in Mondstadt wines?
 You're very interested, no?
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 alois 07.ogg Alois: Y—Yes! Just interested, mind you.
 ...Noelle's way of showing hospitality.
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 alois 08.ogg Alois: Aha... o—okay then...
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 alois 09.ogg Alois: On another note, that drink's made me realize just how empty my stomach is...
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Oh, so you're hungry too!
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: ...How terrible of me. If I'd realized, I would've saved some pancakes for you.
 Not to worry. Let's go to the Good Hunter restaurant.
Media:vo noecop001 1906203 alois 10.ogg Alois: Oh, good idea! That sounds like a good place!
(Approach Good Hunter)
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 alois 01.ogg Alois: Mmmm... smells incredible! So it's true... If you really want to sell Mondstadt wines, you can't do without Mondstadt dishes...
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 alois 02.ogg Alois: Maybe recipes will be easier to obtain than the brewing process...
 Brewing process?
 Easier to obtain?
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 alois 03.ogg Alois: Oh! Uhh, what I mean is... the Dandelion Wine brewing process is unique — difficult to imitate! That's why we merchants can buy with confidence!
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 alois 04.ogg Alois: Haha, where was I... Let's see, what's on the menu... Hmm, so many dishes... hard to decide...
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Can I help?
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 alois 05.ogg Alois: Uh, sure... What do you suggest?
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Hm... Well, do you prefer red meat or white?
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 alois 06.ogg Alois: I like 'em both.
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: The Steaks here are cuts of freshly shipped Springvale Boar. I'd recommend having it served medium to really bring out the natural sweetness of the meat.
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Mm... oh! Sweet Madame is another specialty. Crispy skin and tender meat — goes perfectly with wine!
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: However, those dishes alone aren't very healthy from a nutritional standpoint.
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: I recommend a Mushroom Pizza and a Satisfying Salad too on the side.
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: If that sounds okay, I'll place the order for you. This meal is on me, to make up for my inattentiveness.
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 alois 07.ogg Alois: That's too generous of you...
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Please, enjoy. After all, it's your first meal here as a new visitor, and your last. I wouldn't want to give you the cold shoulder.
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 alois 08.ogg Alois: Huh? *coughing* M—My last!? *choking*
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 alois 09.ogg Alois: ...You give this meal to... all new visitors, right?
 This one was made especially for you.
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 alois 10.ogg Alois: Wait... Is it really my last meal?
 Your last meal as a new visitor, of course. So enjoy!
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 alois 11.ogg Alois: Ah, haha... so that's what it means... Well, then I better make the most of it...
 It's just Noelle's way of showing hospitality.
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 alois 12.ogg Alois: Aha... o—okay then...
 Where are we going after the meal?
 Noelle, do we have anything else on the itinerary?
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: How about With Wind Comes Glory?
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: For our final stop, I want to leave Mr. Alois with something to commemorate his time here.
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 alois 13.ogg Alois: So... that's the final stop, yes?
Media:vo noecop001 1906204 alois 14.ogg Alois: Wait... what are we commemorating?
(Approach Marjorie)
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 marjorie 01.ogg Marjorie: Oh, here's your order, Noelle.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Thanks, Marjorie.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Mr. Alois, please accept this souvenir.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 01.ogg Alois: Eh-he, thanks. I will treasure this wood carving forev— ...Eh?
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 02.ogg Alois: Wait, what's on the... Is that... the insignia of the Knights of Favonius?
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: I, maid Noelle, on behalf of Mondstadt and the Knights of Favonius, officially welcome you!
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 03.ogg Alois: Wait... Knights of Favonius? How can you be both a maid and a part of the Knights of Favonius?
 She's a maid of the Knights of Favonius.
 She's a future knight of Favonius.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 04.ogg Alois: So, so this gift is also a...
 This one was made especially for you.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 05.ogg Alois: So it's... a warning!
 It's just Noelle's way of showing hospitality.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 06.ogg Alois: ...So, just a regular souvenir?

Branch 1[]

Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Oh, I'm afraid this is all I had time for...
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: However, I hope it leaves you with a lasting impression of your trip to Mondstadt.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Now then, if you wouldn't mind accompanying me to the Knights of Favonius, the registration process only requires—
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 07.ogg Alois: Ah—! N—no need! I uhh... suddenly I remember where I lost my luggage!
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Oh? Well then we should at least go and file a report with the Knights—
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 08.ogg Alois: —Nope, not necessary! Now that the danger's past [sic], I'll just head over and retrieve it!
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Huh? But... what about the savage monsters...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: For your protection, I feel strongly that one of our knights should escort you there.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: Or... perhaps it's a little too soon but...
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: ...I'll escort you. Let's go!
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 09.ogg Alois: Ugh...
 No need.
 Allow me.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Oh? ...You want to escort him yourself, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: ...That would certainly put my mind at rest...
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: In that case, I'll report the situation to Swan. Let's meet back at the gates of the city a little later.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: Please take care of Mr. Alois.

After Hospitality Comes...[]
 Quest DescriptionNoelle's passionate reception is putting an immense amount of pressure on Alois, who just wants to leave...

(Approach the end of the bridge)
Media:vo noecop001 1906206 alois 01.ogg Alois: *whimpers*
 Okay, no further.
Media:vo noecop001 1906206 alois 02.ogg Alois: ...So this is the end?
 I can't see anyone around.
Media:vo noecop001 1906206 alois 03.ogg Alois: Meaning this is a good spot!?
 If you understand, then nothing needs to be said.
 If you don't understand, it's pointless to explain.
Media:vo noecop001 1906206 alois 04.ogg Alois: Archons above! Oh, honorable knight, please have mercy! Forgive me! I'll confess! I'll confess to everything!
Media:vo noecop001 1906206 alois 05.ogg Alois: I was planning to investigate Mondstadt's Dandelion Wine — to see if I could find a way to imitate it!
Media:vo noecop001 1906206 alois 06.ogg Alois: I didn't expect you to see through it right from the start! Please! I—I never actually did anything!
Media:vo noecop001 1906206 alois 07.ogg Alois: It's attempted fraud at worst, right? Tell me it isn't punishable by death!
Media:vo noecop001 1906206 alois 08.ogg Alois: Or... or is it because you have no intention to try me at all...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906206 alois 09.ogg Alois: W—Which explains why you didn't expose me in the city — you simply chose a location to finish me!
 ...Go.
Media:vo noecop001 1906206 alois 10.ogg Alois: Spare me, noble kn— ...Wh—What...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906206 alois 11.ogg Alois: Go...? I can go? Really?
 No more scheming against Mondstadt.
Media:vo noecop001 1906206 alois 12.ogg Alois: Of... Of course! With you and the maid around, who would dare?
 ...Change your ways, and you are welcome to visit Mondstadt again.
Media:vo noecop001 1906206 alois 13.ogg Alois: Yes sir! I understand! Goodbye, most honorable Honorary Knight!

(After the cutscene)
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So... he really did have ulterior motives...
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Should we tell Noelle... ? [sic] Let's head back and see how she's doing first.

(Approach Noelle)
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Ah, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), you're back.
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Eh? How come... Mr. Alois isn't with you?
 He left.
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Left? Already? Left Mondstadt...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: ...And I didn't even get around to arranging his accommodations, or introducing the wine merchants to him...
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: ...I must have been... negligent in some way... Did I leave him with a bad impression of Mondstadt...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Why else would he have left without a farewell...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Oh, I... I couldn't even handle this smallest of tasks...
 He had a sinister plot, so I drove him away.
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: A plot? ...So he was scheming the whole time?
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: As expected, I'm still too naive...
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: And that's why we have the Honorary Knight to rely on, in times of trouble...
 He had to get back, it had nothing to do with you.
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: You're just... trying to make me feel better...
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Thank you, but...
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: I must have done something wrong! Our visitor would never have left in such a hurry...
Media:vo noecop001 1906207 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: *sigh* How can I ever become a real knight of Favonius like this...?

Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 10.ogg Alois: I... really don't understand... why you went to all this trouble...
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 11.ogg Alois: I don't have any goods or relevant documents... plus I don't exactly look like your everyday honest merchant.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 12.ogg Alois: Even if there were nothing to suggest otherwise... surely it would've been better to take me straight to the Knights for investigation...
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 13.ogg Alois: ...And yet you still went to all this effort... to prepare all this for me...
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 14.ogg Alois: Didn't you wonder whether the savage monsters — the missing cargo... What if it were all lies?
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: Why would I think that? I'm just doing what a maid of Favonius should do.

Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 20.ogg Noelle: You are a visitor from far away. You should be welcomed by me and by Mondstadt.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 21.ogg Noelle: Even if there really is only a slight possibility that everything you say is true...
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 22.ogg Noelle: Being attacked by savage monsters, losing goods and documents... Isn't it times like these that people need help the most?
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 23.ogg Noelle: And if I failed to offer our hospitality on such an occasion, despite there being no evidence to back up your claims...
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 24.ogg Noelle: ...That's not the way a maid of Favonius should behave!
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 15.ogg Alois: I see... Well, thank you...
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 16.ogg Alois: It's... time for me to leave Mondstadt.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 25.ogg Noelle: Huh? Why the hurry...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 26.ogg Noelle: We haven't recovered your lost property yet...
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 17.ogg Alois: No need. I've just remembered where I left them.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 18.ogg Alois: Somewhere far, far away...
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 19.ogg Alois: I'll be sure to keep a better eye on them next time.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 20.ogg Alois: Perhaps when I'm a visitor worthy of your hospitality, I can return to Mondstadt.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 27.ogg Noelle: Umm... I'm not sure I fully understand what you mean...
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 noelle 28.ogg Noelle: But if you think you can retrieve your lost property, that's great.
 You two clearly aren't talking about the same thing...
 But at least the problem seems to be solved.
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 21.ogg Alois: What a short trip...
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 22.ogg Alois: But... thank you for your care and hospitality, I've learned a lot...
Media:vo noecop001 1906205 alois 23.ogg Alois: Goodbye, Mondstadt. Goodbye, maid of the Knights of Favonius!

 Quest DescriptionOn the Evil Spirits' Trail: Dalong leaves after having been given half the popsicles, feeling quite pleased. After this small interlude, you and Chongyun continue discussing evil spirits. Chongyun hopes to tap on your abundant experience as an adventurer to adjudge the truth or falsehood of information concerning evil spirits. To that end, you had to Wanwen Bookhouse together.The Rumored Heretical Ground: After determining the truth or falsehood of the information you have, you and Chongyun decide on a more valuable lead to pursue.
On the Evil Spirits' Trail[]

(Approach the Wanwen Bookhouse)
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: This is a note I received from a friend. It has many clues about evil spirits on it.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: If we check the books here at Wanwen Bookhouse according to the respective clues on the note, we'll be able to find the complete details of each clue.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: Since you're here to help, I'll just read the clues to you, and you can help me judge if they're credible or not based on your experience.
 Leave it to me.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: Alright, here are the first clues.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: "At the foot of Mt. Qingce is a Violetgrass that has turned into a gigantic, man-eating monster."
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: Also, "There's a ghostly shadow skulking about Feiyun Slope at night. It's suspected to be a vengeful spirit."
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: And finally, "Lurking in Liyue Harbor is a massive demon that was transformed from a popsicle."
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: Huh? I've never encountered any such things before.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: Anyway, could you pick the one that seems most plausible and likely to be the work of evil spirits?
 "Lurking in Liyue Harbor is a massive demon that was transformed from a popsicle."
(−2 Hearts)
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 12.ogg Chongyun: Popsicles can't turn into demons! Besides, I always keep a close eye on my stock of popsicles.
 "At the foot of Mt. Qingce is a Violetgrass that has turned into a gigantic, man-eating monster."
(−2 Hearts)
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: ...This one seems unlikely. If such a thing did exist, there would be many witnesses in Qingce Village, but nobody has yet to see it.
 "There's a ghostly shadow skulking about Feiyun Slope at night. It's suspected to be a vengeful spirit."
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 11.ogg Chongyun: Hmm, this is possible, but it sounds too similar to previous rumors. Many people often pass through Feiyun Slope, so perhaps it's just some sort of misunderstanding.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 13.ogg Chongyun: Hmm, how about these clues?
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 14.ogg Chongyun: "Deep in the Sea of Clouds, a marauding demon has been raiding commercial fishing boats and building a luxurious palace."
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 15.ogg Chongyun: Or, "In Jueyun Karst, there's a piece of thousand-year-old amber that has gained consciousness and now roams about causing trouble."
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 16.ogg Chongyun: And lastly, "It's said that people often see a demon who loves eating chilis in Wanmin Restaurant."
 "Deep in the Sea of Clouds, a marauding demon has been raiding commercial fishing boats and building a luxurious palace."
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 17.ogg Chongyun: This one does seem possible, but it also sounds like a tale from unverifiable sources. Plus, we don't have any means of investigating the deep sea, either.
 "In Jueyun Karst, there's a piece of thousand-year-old amber that has gained consciousness and now roams about causing trouble."
(−2 Hearts)
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 18.ogg Chongyun: Jueyun Karst is the territory of the Adepti. If there were such a thing, the Adepti would certainly take action...
 "It's said that people often see a demon who loves eating chilis in Wanmin Restaurant."
(−2 Hearts)
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 19.ogg Chongyun: Even I can tell that this is talking about Xiangling's little Guoba, not some demon...
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 20.ogg Chongyun: Okay, here are a few more clues.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 21.ogg Chongyun: "A strange man wearing a mask and wielding a pole was once seen in the distance around Guili Plains. There's something eerie about his presence."
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 22.ogg Chongyun: Or, "Someone saw an exorcist with blue hair who is actually a transformed demon." Wait, what?
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 23.ogg Chongyun: And finally, "There is a vigilant demon adept at concealing itself in mist. Recently, people have found traces of it in Mingyun Village, Guili Plains, and Yaoguang Shoal."
 "A strange man wearing a mask and wielding a pole was once seen in the distance around Guili Plains. There's something eerie about his presence."
(−2 Hearts)
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 24.ogg Chongyun: Oh! That must be the Vigilant Yaksha. Don't worry, he's not an enemy.
 "Someone saw an exorcist with blue hair who is actually a transformed demon."
(−2 Hearts)
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 25.ogg Chongyun: Hey! Not funny...
 "There is a vigilant demon adept at concealing itself in mist. Recently, people have found traces of it in Mingyun Village, Guili Plains, and Yaoguang Shoal."
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 26.ogg Chongyun: Now that you mention it, I may have heard of this one. I've been trying to track it, but the spirit's so cautious that I don't think we'll ever have a chance of catching it unless it decides to show itself.
(If at least 1 Heart remains)
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 27.ogg Chongyun: It appears most of these clues are either not reliable or nearly impossible to investigate.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 28.ogg Chongyun: *sigh* It seems there is little here that we can actually use...
 Out of curiosity, who gave you these clues?
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 29.ogg Chongyun: Oh, many of these are from my friend, Xingqiu. He's well-read and very knowledgeable.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 30.ogg Chongyun: Not to mention he's always willing to extend a helping hand. He always provides me with lots of reliable information.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 31.ogg Chongyun: If it weren't for my pure-yang spirit, I would have already vanquished numerous demons because of him, I'm sure of it.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 32.ogg Chongyun: I should find a chance to thank him personally.
 Such... enviable friendship.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 33.ogg Chongyun: Yes, he always goes out of his way for me, but he never seems to mind and helps me all the same. Also, he often has something interesting to say. I'm quite glad that I get along with him.
 Maybe you should change your source of information.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 34.ogg Chongyun: Do... do you mean that I shouldn't trouble him anymore?
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 35.ogg Chongyun: Sorry, I digress. I've found another snippet of information here. There aren't many details, but it clearly mentions Wuwang Hill.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 36.ogg Chongyun: If we include the Test of Courage rumor from before, there are already two clues pointing there.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 37.ogg Chongyun: I've also noticed that the weather in Wuwang Hill has been very abnormal recently. Let's go and have a look. We might just find something useful.
 I hope we can find something there.
Media:vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 38.ogg Chongyun: Alright, let's head out and see what we can find!
(If no Hearts remain)
Hangout Event Ended: Seeing that the Traveler is also unable to make anything more out of the clues, Chongyun bids farewell and leaves in disappointment.

The Rumored Heretical Ground[]

(Approach the designated spot at Wuwang Hill)
Media:vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: This place seems quite... ordinary.
Media:vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: So ordinary that I don't even feel that it's worth investigating.
 Same feeling here.
Media:vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: Wuwang Hill's unusual weather and peculiar surroundings are a source of constant rumors, most of which are untraceable and can never be proven.
Media:vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: So, I suppose this could only be expected...
 It seems you seldom have anything to show for all your efforts. Is that also due to your pure-yang spirit?
Media:vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: I guess so. Like I mentioned before, my yang energy tends to just scare away evil spirits.
Media:vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: You may think it's beneficial for me to have such a condition, and therefore there's no real need for me to practice thaumaturgy.
Media:vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: But if I renounced my practice my thaumaturgy, and one day met an evil spirit that didn't fear my yang energy, then I may not be able to exorcise it.
 No wonder you're so persistent.
Media:vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: If I merely spend my time training without actually putting it into practice, then how would I ever know the fruits of my labor, or what skills I need to improve?
Media:vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: But to this very day, despite the many exorcisms I have performed, I have yet to see a single demon, not to mention one that I needed to defeat using thaumaturgy.
Media:vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: *sigh* Sorry, I—I shouldn't rant like that. I'm fine, I've gotten used to such feelings...
 Don't give up, Chongyun.
Media:vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 11.ogg Chongyun: *sigh* ...You're right. It's a shame to say that I've grown accustomed to such things. You shouldn't have to comfort me.
 Not all rumors are not necessarily fake. Let's have a look around.
Media:vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 12.ogg Chongyun: You're right. I just need to stay disciplined.
Media:vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 13.ogg Chongyun: Since we're already here, let's go check the two locations mentioned in the clue.

(Interact with the Strange Smoke)
Media:vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: What's this...?
Media:vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: I know this mist. It was left by some kind of evil spirit.
Media:vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: It's very thick and never disperses. The evil spirit may have been here recently.
 So it seems the clue was real.
 Great, our efforts have finally paid off!
Media:vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: Yes, it was not all in vain.
Media:vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: But we mustn't act rashly. If this mist remains here, it can easily contaminate the area.
Media:vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: Once it contaminates monsters such as hilichurls, it could even make them more aggressive and dangerous to anyone nearby.
Media:vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: Or if it happens to contaminate any adventurers passing by, the consequences would be unimaginable.
 I'll leave this to you.
 It's your time to shine, Exorcist.
Media:vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: My pleasure.
Media:vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: Let's inspect the surrounding area to see if there's any more mist like this. Once we've cleaned up this mess, we'll continue forward.
Media:vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: Remember, there might be danger ahead. We should be prepared for a fight.
 You're very calm.
 You're very thorough.
Media:vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 11.ogg Chongyun: It's second nature to me... Exorcism is a solemn and serious matter.
Media:vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 12.ogg Chongyun: It's on me if you or anyone else gets hurt due to my negligence.
Media:vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 13.ogg Chongyun: There's no time to lose. Let's go.
(After the cutscene ends)
Media:vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 14.ogg Chongyun: It appears that there are evil spirits here, and not the weak variety.
Media:vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 15.ogg Chongyun: Let's keep going.

(Upon interacting with the Strange Smoke, "contaminated" hilichurls appear)
Media:vo cycop001 1902304 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: I suspected that there would be hilichurls here.
Media:vo cycop001 1902304 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: Let's deal with them all. We mustn't let a single one escape.
(After defeating the hilichurls)
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: These tracks are still fresh. It seems the evil spirit is on the move.
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: The path ends here, as well as the tracks... It'll be difficult to follow it any further.
 I didn't think your pure-yang spirit could be so powerful.
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: It must have sensed me as a threat from a long way off. That's why it ran with such haste.
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: It seems that this is still not the kind of spirit that can overcome my abundant yang energy and fight me head-on.
 But if we don't deal with it, it'll just go somewhere else and harm people, right?
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: *sigh* Don't worry. I'll continue tracking it for a few days. It won't dare show its face around here again.
 But you still won't ever see it, right?
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: Most likely, yes. I'm afraid the best I can do is just scare it away.
 It's a shame that we can't take care of it for good.
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: Yes, defeating it once and for all would certainly make all this worth our efforts.
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: Hm? Why do you seem so disappointed?
 I can't help but feel like this was a waste of our time.
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: No, quite the contrary. Not only did we clean up the traces of an evil spirit, but we also took care of those monsters. We've done our jobs as exorcists.
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: My only regret is that I didn't get to drive it away using my thaumaturgy.
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 11.ogg Chongyun: But I'm already prepared to spend my life chasing this goal, so I do not regret such disappointments.
 Hmm, I guess you're right.
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 12.ogg Chongyun: Yes, so please cheer up.
 Now you're comforting me?
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 13.ogg Chongyun: Of course. I'd never wish for you to be in low spirits on my account.
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 14.ogg Chongyun: Actually, I also wanted to thank you for not leaving me, even with my special condition, and for helping chase the evil spirit to the very end.
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 15.ogg Chongyun: Even if we'd ended up running into an incredibly strong demon, I would've felt much safer with an experienced adventurer like you by my side.
 I'm just doing my duty.
 Your persistence made it hard for me to leave...
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 16.ogg Chongyun: Well, I appreciate it. Oh, it seems the weather is starting to clear up over there. Let's go have a look.
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 17.ogg Chongyun: Hmm, perhaps there's nothing to worry about after all. Even though I didn't come face to face with that evil spirit, at least I met you.
 I'm not an evil spirit.
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 18.ogg Chongyun: Oh, no — that came out wrong. What I'm trying to say is...
Media:vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 19.ogg Chongyun: We shouldn't focus only on the gains and losses of our journey. The things you see and the events you encounter along the way are equally important rewards.

Dialogue[]
 Quest DescriptionAs you approach the wharf of Liyue Harbor, an unusually-dressed young man comes up to you, asking after some really strange business...
Meeting by the Wharf[]

(Talk to Chongyun)
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 01.ogg ???: Excuse me, have you perchance seen any "evil spirits"?
 "Evil spirits"?
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 02.ogg ???: Oh, my apologies. You're not from around here, are you? This question must sound a little confusing to you.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: I'm Chongyun, a local exorcist from Liyue. Those versed in the arts of exorcism refer to all forms of demons and monsters as "evil spirits."
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: Evil spirits have existed since ancient times. They lurk among the shadows in the lands of Liyue, stirring up all sorts of trouble and mischief.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: It is my duty to exorcise or destroy them and protect the citizens here from their evil doings.
 That is an admirable job.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: It's work that must be done, just like any other job. That's all.
 That sounds similar to the work of adventurers.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: Really... Please, enlighten me.
 I have also been traveling across Liyue, rescuing people from monsters, and collecting treasures along the way.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: Oh, I see! There are some similarities.
 I get it, that's what the Vigilant Yaksha fights against, right?
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: How did you come to know of the Vigilant Yaksha?
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: I have great respect for the yakshas. For generations, yakshas and exorcists have been protecting Liyue together, one in plain sight and the other in secret.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 11.ogg Chongyun: Sorry, I digress.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 12.ogg Chongyun: Judging from your response, it seems you aren't well-versed in the realm of evil spirits... But that's understandable. If I may ask, have you happened to come across anything strange recently?
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 13.ogg Chongyun: Sometimes even the most trivial matters prove helpful in my hunt for evil spirits.
 Hmm, nothing in particular.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 14.ogg Chongyun: Oh, I see. Well, fair enough...
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 15.ogg Chongyun: In that case, I guess I'll just have to try my luck with the clues I already have.
 What clues do you have now?
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 16.ogg Chongyun: *sigh* Only some scattered reports, really. Nothing too significant yet...
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 17.ogg Chongyun: But if you're really interested, I can tell you about some of the more useful ones I've gathered so far.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 18.ogg Chongyun: I read a flyer that said: "The Test of Courage is now being held on Wuwang Hill. Bring your best friend and test your courage together!"
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 19.ogg Chongyun: Then: "Recently, the sounds of footsteps and shouting have been heard outside people's windows at night. The noises have frightened the children and they are unable to sleep."
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 20.ogg Chongyun: And: "A huge shadow has appeared in Guili Plains. It flies and swirls, summons down fireballs, and makes all sorts of strange noises."
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 21.ogg Chongyun: Cases such as these might actually be worth our attention.
 Test of Courage... Doesn't that sound like an advertisement?
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 22.ogg Chongyun: I think something strange must have happened at the Test of Courage...
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 23.ogg Chongyun: I guess this so-called "test" is supposed to be like a "test of mettle." Its purpose must be to try the will and power of exorcists.
 Sometimes drunkards pass by people's windows at night, that's nothing unusual.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 24.ogg Chongyun: Hmm, unless there was a problem with the drinks, I don't think drunkards would scare the children that much.
 The shadow in Guili Plains sounds like it may be a Ruin Hunter.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 25.ogg Chongyun: Ruin Hunter? Hmm, that would fit the description, but why has no one recognized it?
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 26.ogg Chongyun: Do you think I'm not deciphering these clues correctly?
 They all sound pretty farfetched, perhaps I should just tell him that. (This dialogue option leads to Distant Gaze.)
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 27.ogg Chongyun: So you don't think any of these clues are related to evil spirits?
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 28.ogg Chongyun: Sorry... Please give me a moment to calm myself.
 I'm sorry, I didn't realize it would be so devastating to you.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 29.ogg Chongyun: ...No, it's fine. I've been this way since I was young.
 Oh, is it... health-related?
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 30.ogg Chongyun: No, not at all. I guess you could say I just tend to be... unstable... you know, emotionally. It causes me to become very uncomfortable at times.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 31.ogg Chongyun: This tendency of getting stirred up easily is what people call a "pure-yang spirit."
 "Stirred up easily"? I couldn't tell that from your appearance...
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 32.ogg Chongyun: Yes, well, such a constitution is very rare, but it's a potent weapon for an exorcist. My constitution alone is capable of scaring off evil spirits.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 33.ogg Chongyun: But I must constantly focus on my emotions... Otherwise, I may easily do something out of control.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 34.ogg Chongyun: ...Anyway... I carefully selected these clues from an ocean of information. I can't believe they're all completely irrelevant.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 35.ogg Chongyun: Oh no... I'm still feeling quite uncomfortable. There's heat growing in my chest... I—I can't breathe.
 Shall I take you to Bubu Pharmacy?
 How about some water?
 Shall I try rubbing your Vision on your forehead?
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 36.ogg Chongyun: No, I'll be alright. I—I brought some popsicles with me for just such occasions.
Chongyun eats the popsicle.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 37.ogg Chongyun: ...I—I feel much better now.
 That's an unexpected solution.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 38.ogg Chongyun: ...It's quite effective. I'm always sure to bring out some popsicles with me whenever I go out.
 It looked tasty.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 39.ogg Chongyun: Actually, they're quite tasteless. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to stomach them.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 40.ogg Chongyun: *sigh* Thank you for your concern. I'm fine now.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 41.ogg Chongyun: But what should I do next if all these clues are irrelevant?
 Actually, it seems someone's been watching us this whole time...
(Camera pans to a boy watching Chongyun and the Traveler eagerly)
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 42.ogg Chongyun: Yes, I've noticed him too.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 43.ogg Chongyun: It's no coincidence that we both noticed it. I'm sure he's watching us.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 44.ogg Chongyun: But it doesn't seem he has any intentions other than looking at us... Perhaps there's something he wishes to tell us?
 Let's go and ask him.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 45.ogg Chongyun: Right, he might need our help.
 Maybe he's just shy.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 46.ogg Chongyun: Hmm, possible... Let's go and ask him.
(Continues to Distant Gaze)
 Although they all seem farfetched, I'd better not tell him that. He seems like quite the persistent character. (This dialogue option leads to Test of Courage.)
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 47.ogg Chongyun: Hmm... I think the clue about the Test of Courage is the most relevant one I have so far.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 48.ogg Chongyun: If strange things have been happening at the event, then evil spirits may well be the cause.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 49.ogg Chongyun: *sigh* But there's an unusual requirement for this event. You must be a team of two people in order to participate.
 Actually, that's quite normal.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 50.ogg Chongyun: Is it? Huh... perhaps you're right. If evil spirits do show up, then the two can take care of each other, I suppose.
 The aim is to strengthen the relationship between the two participants.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 51.ogg Chongyun: Uh...? Strengthen the relationship...? Sorry, I don't really get it.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 52.ogg Chongyun: Anyway, if you have the time, would you join me for this event?
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 53.ogg Chongyun: You seem to have a good eye for discerning these clues. With your adventuring experience, I'm sure we'll track down those evil spirits in no time.
 Okay, I'm free now anyway.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 54.ogg Chongyun: Thank you! I was starting to worry that I wouldn't be able to find a partner.
 Sorry, I'm not interested...
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 55.ogg Chongyun: Please, you must go with me! I don't know if I'll be able to find anyone else suitable to join me.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 56.ogg Chongyun: My best friend is busy with other matters, and I worry that anyone else won't even be able to protect themselves.
 Fine, If you say so.
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 57.ogg Chongyun: Ah, you have my thanks!
Media:vo cycop001 1902101 chongyun 58.ogg Chongyun: We should make haste! If there are evil spirits at the event, then things could get dangerous.
(Continues to Test of Courage)

Memento[]

Media:vo kycop001 1909301 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Look, Mondstadt's windmills... Ah, such a comforting sight.
Media:vo kycop001 1909301 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Now, as promised, your souvenir. Here you go.
Media:vo kycop001 1909301 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: According to the merchant I bought it from, mysterious spirits called Jinn often live in lamps like this, and this lamp in particular once housed a very powerful Jinni.
Media:vo kycop001 1909301 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Merchants love to exaggerate to help make a sale, but it's still quite the pretty little lamp.
Media:vo kycop001 1909301 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: I know you like rare things, so perhaps you can add this to your collection. Of course, you can also use it as an ordinary pot. Personally, I think it'd make an excellent wine vessel.
 Thank you, I'll put it on display.
 Thank you, I'll use it as a decanter.
Media:vo kycop001 1909301 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: You're welcome, I'm glad you like it.
Media:vo kycop001 1909301 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: I'm ready to head into the city now. You're free to join me, or you can make your own schedule.
Media:vo kycop001 1909301 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: I could give everyone their souvenirs first... But I'm not sure whether I'm in the mood for running around and visiting people right after the long journey.
Media:vo kycop001 1909301 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Maybe I'll take a breather first... But I know I'll only get bored sitting in my room alone... Ugh, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), do you have any suggestions?
 We can chill out together, so you can relax without getting bored. (This dialogue option leads to Poems Dedicated to the Wind.)
Media:vo kycop001 1909301 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: I'm honored to have such a caring friend.
Media:vo kycop001 1909301 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Hmm... Let's go to the plaza in front of the Cathedral. We can listen to the bards playing or feed the pigeons.
Media:vo kycop001 1909301 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: After so long in Sumeru, I've begun to miss that slow-paced and relaxed atmosphere.
Media:vo kycop001 1909301 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: There's no rush, we can take our time and stroll on over.
 I can join you for the souvenir-giving, so you have some company. (This dialogue option leads to An Ordinary Day for the Knights of Favonius.)
Media:vo kycop001 1909301 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: Yes, I suppose... Okay. Souvenir run it is. They're mostly people you know, so it'll be a chance for you to say hi to some people you haven't seen in a while.
Media:vo kycop001 1909301 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: Let's start by going to the Knights of Favonius headquarters. Jean and Lisa will definitely be there, and with any luck, we might run into a few others, too.

A Change of Pace[]
(Upon Arriving Puspa Café)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 01.ogg Layla: Let's sit down here and have some coffee and sweets. It'll help me put my thoughts together.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 02.ogg Layla: Ah no, we're here to rest... My problems will have to wait for now.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 munirah 01.ogg Munirah: Oh, hey Layla!
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 03.ogg Layla: Huh...
 Sorry, but who are you?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 munirah 02.ogg Munirah: I'm one of Layla's classmates. I just came by to say hi.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 munirah 03.ogg Munirah: We just submitted our theses, and we're totally beat. Everyone will be meeting here to celebrate.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 munirah 04.ogg Munirah: Seeing how relaxed you look, you must've already had your thesis finished ages ago.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 04.ogg Layla: Oh, no I... I'm actually having a lot of trouble with it...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 munirah 05.ogg Munirah: You say that every time we talk, but you've never missed a deadline. Not only that, your papers are always well-written and thorough. Your adviser is constantly praising your work.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 munirah 06.ogg Munirah: Yet you're always going around saying stuff like, "I can't make it, I don't understand, I'm super worried..." That kind of talk doesn't reflect your work at all, you know.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 05.ogg Layla: Well, uh I...
 What are you getting at?
 Why are you so hostile towards Layla?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 munirah 07.ogg Munirah: For starters, she doesn't even try to participate with the group at all. It's one thing that she's not willing to help us, but she doesn't even bother showing up for our discussion meetings.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 munirah 08.ogg Munirah: Every time we come to see her, she looks out of sorts and on the verge of a breakdown.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 munirah 09.ogg Munirah: It's not like we can't finish our own theses without her, but no one wants to always see her this way.
(Stress Value +1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 06.ogg Layla: Ugh, I know, I know... sorry.
 Everyone is entitled to their own choices. You should learn to respect that.
 Just because Layla breaks the mold doesn't mean it's a problem.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 munirah 10.ogg Munirah: Whatever. There's no point in starting an argument here.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 munirah 11.ogg Munirah: If you think she can justify her behavior, then that's your opinion. Hmph.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 07.ogg Layla: Thanks for standing up for me.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 08.ogg Layla: I really want to help the others, but most of the time I'm barely scraping by myself... There's very little I can help with...
 Is it because you don't want others to know about the "blessing from the stars"?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 09.ogg Layla: Yeah. I can't ever tell my classmates about that. I'd be a mess if they ever reported it to my adviser...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 10.ogg Layla: It's really just a big misunderstanding, and there's nothing I can do about it... Everyone just gives me weird looks and judges me... It's making it really difficult to find friends.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 11.ogg Layla: It's actually pretty rare for someone to actively engage in a conversation with me like you do.
 I think I understand your situation now.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 12.ogg Layla: Huh, what do you mean?
 You think that the blessing from the stars is some external power that's out of your control.
 Only by improving yourself and no longer relying on an external power can you break out of the vicious cycle.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 13.ogg Layla: *sigh* ...Yeah, that's exactly it. Seems you know just as well as I do.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 14.ogg Layla: The thing is, I'm terrible under pressure, that's just my nature. Even the thought of everyone's expectations back home is enough to make me feel nervous...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 15.ogg Layla: And the more nervous I get, the worse things become around me. Take what Munirah just said for example... I don't think I'll be able to get it out of my mind for the entire day... That means I won't be able to relax at all today...
 Why don't we try facing the problem head-on? (This dialogue option leads to The Helper.)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 16.ogg Layla: Face it head-on? Wh—What should I do? Do you really think I can...?
 It's simple, just break down the unfinished parts of the thesis into different tasks and tackle them one by one.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 17.ogg Layla: Oh... okay... I've got a pen and paper with me. Let me go through them real quick.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 18.ogg Layla: Hmm...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 19.ogg Layla: The theory sections are pretty much finished. I'll be able to finish organizing the rest on my own.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 20.ogg Layla: As of now, I'm missing crucial observation data. I need the results of an observation to validate the conclusion of my thesis...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 21.ogg Layla: And then there's the preparation for my thesis defense... I'll need to mentally prepare.
 Those don't sound too difficult. I can help you.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 22.ogg Layla: What? You want to help me with my thesis?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 23.ogg Layla: Uh, thank you... thank you so much. I don't even know how to show you my gratitude.
 Don't worry about it. We've already come this far.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 24.ogg Layla: You're so kind. I had no idea I'd meet someone so nice in Sumeru City.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 25.ogg Layla: Okay, I'll do my best! It's the least I can do considering everything you've already done for me.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 26.ogg Layla: First on the list is the experiment to get observational data. I actually had it all planned out several days ago and even borrowed a celestial globe from a Mahamata.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 27.ogg Layla: However, the weather was rainy every single day after I borrowed it, and I was unable to compare the night sky against the celestial globe.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 28.ogg Layla: There were a lot of people waiting to borrow the celestial globe, and I wasn't able to extend my time slot. So I returned it and haven't been able to borrow it again since.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 29.ogg Layla: That's why I still haven't performed the necessary observations yet. I don't know what to do.
 So you're lacking some equipment...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 30.ogg Layla: That's right. The celestial globe is a high precision device used specifically for researching the stars. Submitting an application to borrow one from the Akademiya is pretty much the only way for me to get my hands on one.
 Looks like we're gonna have to ask around at the Adventurers' Guild.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 31.ogg Layla: Huh? Why the Adventurers' Guild?
 Because no one has a network like Katheryne does.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 32.ogg Layla: Oh, I see. The Adventurers' Guild is open to everyone's commissions, so she might have some ideas.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 33.ogg Layla: Okay, let's go and try our luck.
(Proceed to The Helper)
 Sounds like we need to find a way for you to completely relax. (This dialogue option leads to Fresh Air.)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 34.ogg Layla: C—Completely relax? But we're at a cafe, is this not relaxing enough...?
 You're taking your studies too seriously.
 Academics are only one part of life.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 35.ogg Layla: I know, I know, but...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 36.ogg Layla: *sigh* Alright, no more buts... My life is a mess because of the decisions I've made for myself. I should listen to your advice this time.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 37.ogg Layla: How do I completely relax?
 Since you're from the countryside, why don't we leave Sumeru City and go sightseeing?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 38.ogg Layla: Sightseeing... Hmm, that does sound pretty nice. I haven't set foot outside the Akademiya in quite a while.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 39.ogg Layla: I used to enjoy visiting the rainforest... but it's been a while since I've been there. Maybe a lot has changed...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915702 layla 40.ogg Layla: Okay, why don't we go there and take a look?
(Proceed to Fresh Air)

 Quest DescriptionYun Jin wandered into a perilous place while searching for inspiration, and would have been in trouble if not for your intervention. To thank you, she agrees to teach you some acting techniques...

Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Good. You're right on time.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: Punctuality is an essential quality if you want to make it big in the acting world.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: Without it, you won't be able to keep on top of all the work you need to do each day.
 So where should we start?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: Well... first, I'd like you to answer me one question.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: How many pigeons flew from the bridge when you were passing through?
 Six.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: Close. It was seven.
 Seven.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: Huh? Yes, that's right... I'm amazed. Are you this good at everything...
 Eight.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: Close. It was seven.
(If there were no pigeons at the bridge)

 I didn't notice any pigeons...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 08.ogg Yun Jin: Oh... Perhaps someone scared them off before you arrived?
 I... have no idea...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 09.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm... Alright, never mind. We'll come back to that another time.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 10.ogg Yun Jin: Anyway. The point of this question was to test your powers of observation.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 11.ogg Yun Jin: Eyes are the medium for the transfer of emotion. You must train your eyes to be bright, active, and strong.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 12.ogg Yun Jin: Watching the birds fly off, hover around, and come into land will not only exercise your eyesight but also cultivate attentiveness.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 13.ogg Yun Jin: Indeed, my own daily training routine starts right here. I watch the pigeons to train my eyes, and I sing to the tide to train my voice.
 So next I need to train my voice?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 14.ogg Yun Jin: All in good time. Grasping all the techniques involved in opera singing and posture is not an overnight process
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 15.ogg Yun Jin: Let's start from the very beginning, with some general theories to help you better understand the concept of performance.
 General theories?
 The concept of performance?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 16.ogg Yun Jin: Of course. I am in written correspondence with performers from many nations in Teyvat, which has rather broadened my perspective on this topic.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 17.ogg Yun Jin: For example... Hmm... Let's start with something simple.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 18.ogg Yun Jin: How would you perform yourself?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 19.ogg Yun Jin: Try to relive the events of that day when you were battling against an ancient god and fighting off the Fatui. What can you see? What did you feel?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 20.ogg Yun Jin: Now, I want you to look out at the ocean in front of you, and recall the raging waves and the atmosphere of peril from that day...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 21.ogg Yun Jin: Take a deep breath... now, gradually, embrace the scene, immerse yourself in it... and let all the emotions back in...
 The rage I felt trying to fend off the Fatui.
 The fear of being overwhelmed by an evil god.
 The camaraderie of fighting alongside trusted companions.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 22.ogg Yun Jin: Good, good... so that's how you felt...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 23.ogg Yun Jin: Next, I'd like you to focus on the goal you wanted to achieve at that time...
 To survive and continue my journey.
 To protect Liyue and my friends.
 To defeat the opposing god and Fatui forces.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 24.ogg Yun Jin: Good, yes, use that...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 25.ogg Yun Jin: Okay. Good! Now! All of this overwhelming emotion is welling up inside of you, and I want you to let it all out! All at once! Go!
 Fa-la-laaaa...
 Ha-ha-haaaa...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 26.ogg Yun Jin: Stop!
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 27.ogg Yun Jin: Wrong. This is all wrong. There's no emotion, no soul...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 28.ogg Yun Jin: Granted, the character you are trying to portray is your own self, but your performance didn't do the scene justice at all.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 29.ogg Yun Jin: I couldn't hear you fighting for your life while gargantuan waves were crashing all around you. What I heard was the sound of someone doing vocal exercises by the beach on a calm day.
 If I may, we are by the beach, and it is a calm day.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 30.ogg Yun Jin: Here's the thing. When you're acting, it's not only about getting into character — you also have to recreate the scene in your mind, as vividly as you can.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 31.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm... Now, I appreciate that you did actually experience this particular scene for yourself, but...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 32.ogg Yun Jin: Maybe conjuring up specific details of your surroundings at the time is a little too advanced for novices?
 Well, it was a life-and-death situation...
 It was a pretty rare experience, even for me...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 33.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm, you're right. If we were looking for an environment to help evoke the emotions you felt at the time...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 34.ogg Yun Jin: I suppose we could try again a little farther afield, at Guyun Stone Forest...
 N—No need to go all the way out there!
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 35.ogg Yun Jin: Oh? Too far away?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 36.ogg Yun Jin: Don't worry. I was just thinking aloud. Besides, even at Guyun Stone Forest, we'd still have trouble recreating the state of the sea that day.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 37.ogg Yun Jin: Let's try something else. Come with me to the suburbs just north of Liyue Harbor.
 (Sounds closer than Guyun Stone Forest, at least...)
 (It's not too far from Liyue Harbor...)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904701 yunjin 38.ogg Yun Jin: If you've got no objections, then let's head off.

Well-Honed Performance[]

(At the location)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904702 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: The battle you fought on the Jade Chamber was a very strange set of circumstances, even for someone like you. It's quite normal that you can't get into character just like that.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904702 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: I know it's hard to recreate every facet of the experience in your mind.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904702 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: But what you could try is to replace the foes you faced in that scenario with ones you are much more familiar with.
 What do you mean, "replace"?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904702 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: I'll give you an example. Let's say you're performing a scene where your character experiences the grief and pain of a death, but you yourself have never experienced this kind of tragic loss before.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904702 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: Well, you can replace "death" with another, more familiar, scenario that evokes a similar sense of grief and pain for you. Such as... um...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904702 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: You bust a gut trying to find a treasure chest, only to finally reach it and find it filled with Cabbages and Radishes.
 Oh, the pain! The pain of it all!
Media:vo yjcop001 1904702 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: Ah! Now you're catching on.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904702 yunjin 08.ogg Yun Jin: Action scenes work the same way. Perhaps the experience of facing an ancient god is a challenge to recreate...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904702 yunjin 09.ogg Yun Jin: But if you're replaying the kind of actions you perform every day, you just need to let go and your subconscious will guide you through.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904702 yunjin 10.ogg Yun Jin: Come, show me how you normally fight — you can start with monsters nearby.
(Talk to Yun Jin, optional)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904750 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Don't overthink it. Just fight like you normally do.

(At the start of the battle)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904751 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: They're coming. Just do what you'd normally do in this situation.
(After the battle)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904703 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Oh, that was wonderful! Such deft and fluid movements...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904703 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: Just like a real adventurer!
 I am a real adventurer...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904703 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: Let's perform the scene again now, while the battle is still fresh in your mind.
Yun Jin gets set up nearby...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904703 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: Look at those red-clad scarecrows — but I want you to see them instead as those Fatui who brandish the Sacrificial Knives...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904703 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: Come, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Let us reenact the battle on the Jade Chamber.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904703 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: It's okay if you can't recall the events clearly. You can just replace them with the movements you are most familiar with...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904703 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: And... attack, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! "The three adepti are manning the Guizhong Ballistas. Do not let the Fatui disturb their work!"
(Talk to Yun Jin, optional)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904752 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: "The three adepti are manning the Guizhong Ballistas. Do not let the Fatui disturb their work!"

(After the training)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm...
 H-how did it go?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: I can't fault your movements in terms of technique...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: But Fatui are larger than most monsters.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: I don't think it was a conscious decision, but you were aiming a little too low, and you also didn't strike with enough force. Overall, it was just lacking that sense of being in the heat of the battle.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: Veteran practitioners of this acting method are able to adjust and embellish their real life experience enough so that it makes an adequate substitute for the scene they are trying to portray.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: But adjusting deep-rooted habits to adapt them for the stage... that's no easy task.
 Yeah, it doesn't sound easy...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: Still, this was only your first time trying this method and all things considered, I think you've done quite well.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 08.ogg Yun Jin: But judging from your movements, I think this next method might suit you a little better.
 What is it?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 09.ogg Yun Jin: Choreograph every aspect of your onstage performance in advance — every movement, every facial expression, even your emotions — and rehearse it thoroughly.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 10.ogg Yun Jin: You can reference existing characters from opera or imitate similar people from your own life...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 11.ogg Yun Jin: In short, you want to pin down every detail of the character you want to portray in your mind, and then work through them methodically and find ways to bring them out.
 I don't fully understand...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 12.ogg Yun Jin: Well... In your case, what you need to do is imitate your past self.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 13.ogg Yun Jin: Think of yourself not as you, but as somebody outside this world controlling your every move...
 That's even harder to understand!
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 14.ogg Yun Jin: Heh. It's complicated to explain, but once you give it a try, I think you'll get the hang of it.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 15.ogg Yun Jin: Okay, how about we start by setting a simple scenario.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 16.ogg Yun Jin: The Fatui in red want to attack the Guizhong Ballista and the heavyweight guards in blue want to try and stop you.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 17.ogg Yun Jin: What you want to do is evade all the blues and go straight for the reds...
Yun Jin tells you the various details...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 18.ogg Yun Jin: ...Yes, I think that sums it up.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 19.ogg Yun Jin: There's an open area to the north. I'll set up a stage for you.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904704 yunjin 20.ogg Yun Jin: When you've finished rehearsing everything in your mind, come and find me.

Meticulous Performance[]
 Step DescriptionUnder Yun Jin's careful tutelage, you start to grasp the basics of performing...

(Talk to Yun Jin)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904705 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Well? Have you finished rehearsing?
 What was I supposed to be doing again...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904705 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: Um... basically, you need to break all the red scarecrows while avoiding the blue ones.
 I'm ready. I think.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904705 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: No need to rush. Take your time.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904705 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: I shall guide you with my voice...

(While you are breaking red scarecrows)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904754 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: (Translated) Thus did it transpire:
Media:vo yjcop001 1904754 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: (Translated) Ten thousand swords could stay not (‍hishisText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) advance.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904754 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: (Translated) Eschewing blue, (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍) once more ventured through their ranks.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904754 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: (Translated) "Commander down, red coattails torn in twain!"
Media:vo yjcop001 1904754 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: (Translated) They fled in terror, peace restored again.
(If time runs out)

(Return to the previous step)
(If you break blue scarecrow)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904753 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Wrong, wrong, wrong! Start again!
(Return to the previous step)

(After the training)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Now that was a little better! You managed to bring out more of that "fearless hero" quality that time.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm-hmm. My hard work coaching you has finally paid off.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: This method might not sound as sophisticated and exciting as the first two, but it's the most popular choice for teaching beginners.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: Rigorous rehearsal and vocal training is at the core of this school of thought. It even works on those whose performance lacks emotional depth at first.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: As long as you practice diligently, with time, you will achieve mastery one way or another. Either your finely honed skills become a good substitute for innate talent, or the process of honing your skills cultivates genuine talent within you.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: People say that when you truly master the art of singing, even the birds and beasts will be drawn to your song.
 That's amazing!
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: I know. Looks like I still have a long road ahead of me when it comes to developing as a performer...
 Couldn't you have gone with the beginner's method first?
 Why on earth didn't you start with this one?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 08.ogg Yun Jin: Well, because... even if I had, you wouldn't have put your heart into it.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 09.ogg Yun Jin: It's been written on your face this whole time: "Just try and keep her occupied until the next show."
 Was it that obvious...?
 I thought I was doing a good job of hiding it...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 10.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm-hmm, don't forget that acting is my bread and butter. Did you really think I wouldn't be able to see through it?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 11.ogg Yun Jin: Still, this is a rare opportunity and I hope you have at least learned something from it about the beauty of the performing arts.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 12.ogg Yun Jin: The operatic tradition carries countless historical memories within it. As long as the art is kept alive, the voices and faces of bygone heroes can be recreated on the stage for generation after generation.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 13.ogg Yun Jin: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), I hope that your voice and your face will make their mark on Liyue opera, too.
 My voice and face...?
 Make a mark on Liyue opera?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 14.ogg Yun Jin: Yes. As well as coaching you today, I have also been closely observing every movement you make.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 15.ogg Yun Jin: Do you remember the basics of the final method?
 Reference existing characters from opera...
 Imitate similar people from your own life...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 16.ogg Yun Jin: Don't you think there's a striking similarity between you, who stood up for Liyue and fought off a god of old, and the divine damsel in the play?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 17.ogg Yun Jin: With you as a reference in mind, I'm sure I can finally make a breakthrough in creating my own adaptation of this character.
 Studying me can help you achieve a breakthrough?
 So why was your first method to go and put yourself in danger?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 18.ogg Yun Jin: Because as far as I'm concerned, the immersion method, drawing on life experiences, and imitating others are all valuable acting methods.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 19.ogg Yun Jin: Even if my every movement is rehearsed to perfection, I can't move the audience without conveying emotion.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 20.ogg Yun Jin: And even if I fully master the character's emotions, a little choreography will help make the performance more polished and appealing.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 21.ogg Yun Jin: Whatever the method is, as long as it offers something that can improve my performance, I will always give it a try.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 22.ogg Yun Jin: Thank you for trying them out as well, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). It means a lot to me.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 23.ogg Yun Jin: And congratulations on making it to the end of your first acting class!
 When's my graduation ceremony?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 24.ogg Yun Jin: Graduation ceremony? Hah, I'm afraid that's still a long way in the future.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 25.ogg Yun Jin: For now, I hope to incorporate part of you into my performance of the divine damsel. But one day... I hope to write an opera all about you...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 26.ogg Yun Jin: When that day comes, I hope you will be able to join me on stage, and give me some constructive criticism.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 27.ogg Yun Jin: It'll take a lot of hard work to reach the point where you're ready to go on stage... but I'll be here to keep you on track every step of the way.
 You're such a strict teacher.
 You're a demanding coach.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 28.ogg Yun Jin: Ugh, here we go again, so old-fashioned...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 29.ogg Yun Jin: Then again, I suppose I will have to give you a lot of instruction along the way.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 30.ogg Yun Jin: And if I won't let you call me master, teacher, or coach, I've got to think of something you can call me...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 31.ogg Yun Jin: Ah! I've got it. You can call me...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904706 yunjin 32.ogg Yun Jin: "Mentor." What do you think?

The Auction[]
 Quest DescriptionAfter finishing her meal, Ningguang is worried about the auction that her secretaries are in charge of, and so you go to inspect the site with her. What's got her all concerned, you wonder?

(Go to the site where the auction is being held)
(Talk to the secretary in charge of preparations)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913401 baixiao 01.ogg Baixiao: Lady Ningguang, what brings you here?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913401 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: I couldn't help but feel a little concerned, so I just came to see how everything is going.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913401 baiwen 01.ogg Baiwen: We're about ready, and people are starting to arrive. I think we should be able to start on time.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913401 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Very good. I think I'll host the auction myself.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913401 baixiao 02.ogg Baixiao: Huh? You want to do it yourself?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913401 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: Yes, just in case anything untoward happens. I can take care of it myself.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913401 baixiao 03.ogg Baixiao: Then we'll leave the auction itself to you, but we'll be sure to lend our full support behind the scenes.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913401 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: Have you attended an auction before?
 I've watched one from the sidelines.
 My net worth isn't quite in that category.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913401 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: Well, would you like to participate this time? You don't have to bid, of course. Just experience the atmosphere.
 Sure. That should be quite fun.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913401 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: Alright then. Feel free to take a look around the venue before it kicks off.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913401 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: Check out the items up for bidding and see if there's anything you might be interested in.
(Talk to Ningguang again)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913401 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: Check out the items up for bidding and see if there's anything you might be interested in.

(Inspect the goods on auction)
(Talk to Xiaofei)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 xiaofei 01.ogg Xiaofei: Anything Lady Ningguang used to own is sure to be worth a significant amount of money.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 xiaofei 02.ogg Xiaofei: So even if the price is a little inflated, it should still be fine...
(Talk to Yingfeng)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 01.ogg Yingfeng: Did you bring plenty of Mora with you?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 02.ogg Yingfeng: Let's put it this way — anything you can snag in one of Lady Ningguang's auctions is practically Mora in the bank. The more you take home, the bigger your fortune.
(Talk to Little Bin)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 littlebin 01.ogg Little Bin: Hmm, I can't see anything that particularly interests me...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 littlebin 02.ogg Little Bin: Lady Ningguang must know what she's doing though. I'm sure she has her reasons.
(Observe the Vase)
Observe Vase: (A plain-looking vase with clear signs of wear and tear.)
Observe Vase: (Can't see any reason to bid on something like this.)
(Observe the Writing Tools)
Observe Writing Tools: (Generic office implements. I guess they could brighten the place up a little.)
Observe Writing Tools: (Still, it'd be cheaper to get one from Bolai...)
(Observe the Hairpin)
Observe Hairpin: (A fairly well-made hairpin, but there's nothing exceptional about it.)
Observe Hairpin: (Fine to buy in a shop, but can this really fetch a good price at an auction?)

The Final Call[]

(Wait for the auction to start (16:00–18:00))
(Talk to Ningguang again before changing the time)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: While we're waiting for the auction to begin, feel free to check out the lots or just stretch your legs.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Maybe you'll find something that catches your eye.
(Attend the auction)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: It's about time to start. Find yourself somewhere to sit and we'll kick things off.
 Before we start, I have a question.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Yes? What is it?
 Are these auction items genuinely very valuable?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: That's for you to make a considered judgment on.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: It's precisely what makes auctions so interesting, don't you think?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: Until the bids exceed the value of the item in your eyes, you can keep raising the price. If the bids go beyond what you can accept, then you let someone else take it.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: Perhaps this does not result in what you might call a fair price. But what it does do is identify the person who values the item the most.
 Okay. Let's see how it goes...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: Yes. You should look forward to it.
The auction finally begins.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: The first lot is a teacup from my personal collection. Bids starting at 10,000 Mora, that's 10,000 Mora for the teacup.
 (You'd never pay 10,000 Mora for something like this normally.)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 xiaofei 01.ogg Xiaofei: 20,000!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 yingfeng 01.ogg Yingfeng: 30,000!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 littlebin 01.ogg Little Bin: 50,000!
 (Wow, the bidding is fierce...)
 60,000!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: ...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 yingfeng 02.ogg Yingfeng: 80,000! 80,000 over here!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 xiaofei 02.ogg Xiaofei: I'll raise that to 100,000!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 littlebin 02.ogg Little Bin: 120.
 (He seems very determined.)
 130!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 yingfeng 03.ogg Yingfeng: I swear some of these bidders are just driving the price up for fun...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 yingfeng 04.ogg Yingfeng: Alright, 150,000! Anyone else want to keep going now?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: One-fifty once.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 littlebin 03.ogg Little Bin: Uh... 170!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 yingfeng 05.ogg Yingfeng: 180,000!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 xiaofei 03.ogg Xiaofei: ...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 littlebin 04.ogg Little Bin: ...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: One-eighty once...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: One-eighty twice.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: One-eighty. Sold.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 yingfeng 06.ogg Yingfeng: Hehe. It's mine now!
 (I can't believe it went for 180,000...)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: Okay then, moving straight on to the next lot.
One by one, the unexceptional items are sold for exceptionally high prices...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: You seemed to be getting quite into it. What a shame that you didn't manage to go home with anything.
 Something felt off.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 16.ogg Ningguang: Haha. Of course it did. That's because I didn't come here to sell my things.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 17.ogg Ningguang: I'm sure you must find it quite odd that all these everyday items could fetch such a huge price at auction.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913402 ningguang 18.ogg Ningguang: Since you're curious, why not go and talk to the buyers? I'm sure they'll give you the answers you're looking for.

(Figure out what the attendees are thinking)

Those Whose Faith is Blind[]

(Talk to Ningguang again)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913409 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Go ahead and talk to the buyers. They'll give you the answers you're looking for.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913409 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: I'm sure you will figure out the truth.
(Talk to Xiaofei)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913409 xiaofei 01.ogg Xiaofei: Huh? You want to know why I paid so much?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913409 xiaofei 02.ogg Xiaofei: Well, it's pretty obvious, isn't it? Because the previous owner was Lady Ningguang.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913409 xiaofei 03.ogg Xiaofei: Sure, the item might look pretty ordinary, but that's probably just because I'm not a connoisseur, so I don't know how to appreciate it...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913409 xiaofei 04.ogg Xiaofei: But I figured I'd buy it first, then go get it appraised by an expert. Then I'll be rich! Hehe...
(Talk to Yingfeng)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913410 yingfeng 01.ogg Yingfeng: I may have paid an arm and a leg for this, but in the end I got the result I wanted. Hahaha.
 Aren't you worried about the price being over-inflated?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913410 yingfeng 02.ogg Yingfeng: Nothing of Ningguang's could ever be over-inflated.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913410 yingfeng 03.ogg Yingfeng: I'm far from the only buyer who believes that "owned by Ningguang" is worth paying a premium for. So how much I can make just depends on how many people are even bigger fans of Ningguang than I am!
(Talk to Little Bin)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913411 littlebin 01.ogg Little Bin: *sigh* Today wasn't my day. Didn't manage to snag much.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913411 littlebin 02.ogg Little Bin: There were too many bidders, and they all seemed like experts to me.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913411 littlebin 03.ogg Little Bin: I guess I'll just have to wait for the next auction. Someday, I'll be the lucky one.

(Talk to Ningguang again after talking to the buyers)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: Well? Did you find the answer yet?
 It's because everyone has faith in your judgment and aesthetics.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: That's certainly part of it. But every bidder will have noticed that none of these items have a particularly high going rate on the market in and of themselves.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: Despite this, they were all willing to pay very dearly for them. I wonder... is faith in me really the only factor in their appraisal of the items' value?
 If not, then what else could it be?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: You'll see shortly. The one who spent the most money will surely be the quickest to realize.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: If all I wanted to do was make some quick Mora by exploiting their blind faith in me, I have a million more effective ways of achieving that than hosting an auction.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Every participant in this auction was hand-picked by me, based on certain intelligence.
Sure enough, after some time has passed, one of the participants returns.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 03.ogg Yingfeng: Lady Ningguang, uh... something doesn't seem quite right with the items from today's auction.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 04.ogg Yingfeng: As unlikely as this sounds — and please forgive me for even bringing it up, but I had to ask... uhh... Y—You weren't selling counterfeits today, were you...?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: Counterfeits? Absolutely not. What motive would anyone have for making copies of things like these?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: They are simply ordinary items. And there was no coercion or enticement during the auction — every bid was voluntary.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 05.ogg Yingfeng: Because we trusted you!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 06.ogg Yingfeng: Everyone knows you love Mora, but we also know that you made your fortune through honest means... as opposed to, ahem, scamming people.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: You seem to have entered into dangerous linguistic territory there. You should know that unless you have evidence to support your outlandish claims, I am legally entitled to sue you for slander.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: Of course, if you have any genuine grievances about the auction, the lots, or the process, please enlighten me as to where exactly I went wrong.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 07.ogg Yingfeng: You... You...!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 08.ogg Yingfeng: Fine. Yes, technically, it was all legitimate. Guess all I can do is take the loss...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 09.ogg Yingfeng: But if word gets out about today's auction, people are gonna start seeing you as a con artist. No one would dare do business with you after that.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 10.ogg Yingfeng: I guess what I'm saying is... is this really in your best interests?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: Let me answer that with a question. You claim that you were willing to pay a high price because you trusted me. But is that really the full story?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 11.ogg Yingfeng: Wh—What do you mean? What else could it be?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: Oh, I don't know... perhaps it could be something to do with a lost item from the original Jade Chamber collection that has quietly made its way into your hands?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 12.ogg Yingfeng: ...!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: When the Jade Chamber fell, countless valuable items from my collection plunged into the sea. I organized a salvage operation, but still there were many items unaccounted for.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 16.ogg Ningguang: A considerable number of these made their way back into Liyue Harbor through means unbeknownst to me, and passed through several pairs of hands before finally ending up in yours, and those of your fellow bidders today.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 13.ogg Yingfeng: Wait, you mean...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 17.ogg Ningguang: Yes, everyone attending the auction today is in possession of lost property belonging to me.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 18.ogg Ningguang: Or to put it another way, they were all people who have had a taste of something that was mine and convinced themselves that I am someone to be taken advantage of.
 No wonder they had such blind faith.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 19.ogg Ningguang: So I ask you again. Your high bidding price — was it motivated by trust? Or was it greed?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 14.ogg Yingfeng: Tsk!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 20.ogg Ningguang: The sole reason I held this auction is to reclaim my treasured possessions.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 21.ogg Ningguang: If you are willing to return what is mine, I will refund all the money you spent in the auction today.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 15.ogg Yingfeng: Alright, fine. I guess... I guess I'll return it.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 16.ogg Yingfeng: You drive a hard bargain, like everyone says...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 yingfeng 17.ogg Yingfeng: I'll go and get it right now. Please just wait here.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 22.ogg Ningguang: Despite his bad attitude, he cooperated in the end. Good for him.
 It all makes sense now.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 23.ogg Ningguang: The issue was that all items of mine that have been fished out of the sea have changed hands numerous times already. Determining who has legal ownership would be an extremely long-winded process, with each item being assessed on a case-by-case basis. Even Yanfei says she'd have a difficult time defending my claims.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 24.ogg Ningguang: I could have bought them back, but it's not in my nature to pay twice for the same thing. Least of all when they'd be looking to make a handsome profit from my misfortune.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 25.ogg Ningguang: After making some inquiries, I found them to be most uncooperative. So I had to resort to this auction to finally put a stop to all this nonsense.
 It definitely suits your modus operandi.
 I hope I never end up on the wrong side of you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 26.ogg Ningguang: Hehe. I just wanted my things back. Hardly an unusual sentiment.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 27.ogg Ningguang: At most, a little childish, perhaps. Which is another reason why I didn't tell anybody about my plan.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 28.ogg Ningguang: What do you think it was about the Jade Chamber that defeated Osial?
 The explosion?
 The size?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 29.ogg Ningguang: I think it was a combination of the weight and the energy it contains.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 30.ogg Ningguang: Its great weight meant it hit Osial with incredible force, while the energy within triggered that spectacular explosion.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 31.ogg Ningguang: Every piece of the Jade Chamber, from the stone walls and wooden beams down to the smallest ornament, contributed to its total weight.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 32.ogg Ningguang: But in the end, they became objects of merchants' greed.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 33.ogg Ningguang: It's hard not to get a little irked thinking about it.
 That's not so childish.
 I hope you can get all your things back, too.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 34.ogg Ningguang: Thank you for understanding.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 35.ogg Ningguang: Now I've got one of my items back, let me show you what makes it so special.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913403 ningguang 36.ogg Ningguang: The secrets of history shine through in the relics that survive, and this one now has the story of another age to tell.

 Quest DescriptionDiona would like to go to Dadaupa Gorge to secure a certain special "base drink."
A Special Base Drink[]

Media:vo dancop001 1910301 diona 01.ogg Diona: Dadaupa Gorge is just up ahead. We should be able to find a special drink base there.
Media:vo dancop001 1910301 diona 02.ogg Diona: An adventurer who visited the tavern told me that he once ventured deep into Dadaupa Gorge and discovered a type of drink inside the cooking pots of a hilichurl tribe who lived there.
Media:vo dancop001 1910301 diona 03.ogg Diona: The drink is actually a herbal soup made by samachurls  using a variety of ingredients. According to the adventurer, it seems like the samachurls made these drinks to grant the tribe more energy.
Media:vo dancop001 1910301 diona 04.ogg Diona: The adventurer also said that just by taking a single whiff of it, and I quote...
Media:vo dancop001 1910301 diona 05.ogg Diona: "I wasn't able to determine whether or not I took in the smell, because as soon as I tried to smell it, it felt like my nose was being trampled by a hundred forest boars. I couldn't feel my nose anymore, let alone smell anything..."
Media:vo dancop001 1910301 diona 06.ogg Diona: Hmph, even though he lost his sense of smell, he still remembered to come and drink. He even started telling me that my delicious cocktails would help his nose regain its sense of smell again...
Media:vo dancop001 1910301 diona 07.ogg Diona: What a hopeless drunk... He was probably just exaggerating and hoping for more drinks.
Media:vo dancop001 1910301 diona 08.ogg Diona: But whether or not he was exaggerating is not important. The idea of using a hilichurl drink as a base for my cocktails, haha, is one I'm definitely interested in.
 You want to make a drink... from that?
Media:vo dancop001 1910301 diona 09.ogg Diona: Of course, you wanted a specialty drink, right? Special drinks require special ingredients.
Media:vo dancop001 1910301 diona 10.ogg Diona: No need to worry. This will be one drink you'll remember... forever.
 Maybe we can use something else instead?
Media:vo dancop001 1910301 diona 11.ogg Diona: No way! Normal ingredients will never suffice for a special cocktail, we must use something special.
Media:vo dancop001 1910301 diona 12.ogg Diona: Besides, I've never used such ingredients before either. This will be my latest drink, just wait and you'll be the first one to try it.
Media:vo dancop001 1910301 diona 13.ogg Diona: Now listen up, I had that old adventurer mark the location for me, so all we have to do is get there and grab what we need.
Media:vo dancop001 1910301 diona 14.ogg Diona: Since we're only on the outskirts of Dadaupa Gorge, we'll have to walk further in. We still have quite a ways to go.
(En route)
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 01.ogg Diona: I also told my father about the samachurl herbal soup, he said that he would keep an eye out for it.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 02.ogg Diona: But he's probably just saying that. Once he's had enough drinks in him, he can't even remember his own name, let alone the herbal soup I mentioned.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 03.ogg Diona: Oh well, I never had high hopes for him anyway. Looks like I'm going to have to get the special drink base on my own.
(Going into Dadaupa Gorge)
Media:vo dancop001 1910303 allan 01.ogg ???: Hmm? Someone's approaching...
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 allan 01.ogg Allan: Diona? Is that you?
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 04.ogg Diona: Huh? Oh, I know you... You're the one that usually goes hunting with my father.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 allan 02.ogg Allan: Yeah, my name is Allan. I'm part of the hunting team that Draff leads.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 05.ogg Diona: Huh, so if you're here, that means my father is also somewhere nearby.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 06.ogg Diona: Well, where is he, huh? Oh, I bet he drank too much again after the hunt and fell asleep somewhere, waiting for someone to drag him back to Springvale.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 allan 03.ogg Allan: I—I wish that were the case...
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 allan 04.ogg Allan: I'm afraid that Draff... Well h—he rushed into Dadaupa Gorge by himself!
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 07.ogg Diona: Wait... What!?
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 allan 05.ogg Allan: You see, Draff brought us hunting in the area nearby...
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 allan 06.ogg Allan: Thanks to him, the hunt went really well and we managed to catch lots of game. After the hunt, we stopped to rest for a bit before we'd head back to Springvale.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 allan 07.ogg Allan: So we started a bonfire, got some barbeque going, and well... had a little to drink. Honest! We only drank a little, you know, just to celebrate the hunt.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 allan 08.ogg Allan: But after a few drinks, Draff started saying that he wanted to go get something from a hilichurl tribe in the depths of Dadaupa Gorge.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 allan 09.ogg Allan: He refused to let any of us accompany him. Instead, he kept saying that he's a descendant of the Kätzlein bloodline and that he could come and go as he pleases in a place like this.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 allan 10.ogg Allan: Before we could say anything, he rushed out by himself. There's no way we could stop him.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 allan 11.ogg Allan: I had a hunter who's quick on his feet run back to Springvale to find help, and sent a few veteran hunters into the gorge to look for Draff, but...
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 08.ogg Diona: Ugh! That stupid old man!
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 09.ogg Diona: And it's all because he had something to drink, right!?
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 10.ogg Diona: I don't know how many times I've told him not to drink! He just won't listen!
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 11.ogg Diona: *sigh* I'll go look for him and see what kind of trouble he's got himself into this time!
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 allan 12.ogg Allan: No, wait! It's too dangerous for you to go alone, Diona. Let's wait for more help to arrive and go find him together.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 12.ogg Diona: I'm also of the Kätzlein bloodline, and I'm much better on my feet than he is.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 13.ogg Diona: And most importantly, I don't drink. So I won't be making any of the mistakes that he would.
 Don't worry, I'll go with her.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 allan 13.ogg Allan: You're... Oh! You're the Honorary Knight!
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 allan 14.ogg Allan: There should be nothing to worry about with you by her side. I'll leave you to it.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 14.ogg Diona: You're coming with me to Dadaupa Gorge? There'll be a lot of monsters in there, I wouldn't want to stir them all up at once.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 15.ogg Diona: So I plan on sneaking by the monsters to find my stupid father... What's your plan?
 I'll avoid the monsters as well.
(Go to Branch 1)
 I'll defeat all the monsters head-on.
(Go to Branch 2)
(Talk to Allan again)
Media:vo dancop001 1910305 allan 01.ogg Allan: What could Draff be looking for that made him just charge straight in like that? Maybe some kind of valuable treasure?

Branch 1[]

Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 16.ogg Diona: Really? Alright then, but if you do startle them, be sure not to lure them to me.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 17.ogg Diona: Actually... it wouldn't really matter, because you won't be able to figure out where I'm headed anyway.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 18.ogg Diona: Let's pounce to it then. I'll mark the route on your map.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 19.ogg Diona: Oh — make sure to stick to the route. I'm not coming back for you if you get lost.
(Proceed to The Shadow Over Dadaupa)

Branch 2[]

Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 20.ogg Diona: Take them all head on, huh? Well, you are the Honorary Knight after all...
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 21.ogg Diona: Hmmm...That would work too, I suppose. You can distract the monsters while I sneak around them.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 22.ogg Diona: Let's head deeper into Dadaupa Gorge. I don't know where my foolish father is, but we can start our search there.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 23.ogg Diona: And uh, if the monsters are too strong, then just run away if you can. There are lots of places to hide around here... trust me.
Media:vo dancop001 1910302 diona 24.ogg Diona: Alright, let's get to it! I've marked the approximate location on your map.
(Proceed to The Shadow Over Dadaupa)

 Quest DescriptionChongyun's pure-yang spirit has finally been brought under control, but he is now aware that the strange goings-on during the Test of Courage are a result of human activity. However, neither of you is ready to give up yet, and at Chongyun's suggestion, you split up and continue to search for traces of the paranormal...
As Yet Unresigned[]

(Talk to Qianqian)
Media:vo cycop001 1903203 qianqian 01.ogg Qianqian: *sobbing* Huh...? Um...
Media:vo cycop001 1903203 qianqian 02a.ogg Qianqian: Um... Can... C—Can you help me...?
 Help you?
 Why me?
Media:vo cycop001 1903203 qianqian 03.ogg Qianqian: Um, that exorcist... with that blue hair... is so scary!
Media:vo cycop001 1903203 qianqian 04.ogg Qianqian: C—Can you lead him away from here? He makes me feel so frightened...
 Are you being affected by his yang energy?
Media:vo cycop001 1903203 qianqian 05.ogg Qianqian: I wouldn't dare get anywhere near him... His energy... It's so horrible! It'll make me disappear!
Media:vo cycop001 1903203 qianqian 06.ogg Qianqian: ...I don't want to disappear! Please, help me...
 I wonder if he'd consider you an evil spirit...
 He'll have to be the one that decides what to do.
Media:vo cycop001 1903203 qianqian 07.ogg Qianqian: ...Well... I—I have an idea.
Media:vo cycop001 1903203 qianqian 08.ogg Qianqian: Um... I—I saw the exorcist with blue hair a—arguing with someone over there a few minutes ago.
Media:vo cycop001 1903203 qianqian 09.ogg Qianqian: I'll scare those troublemakers away, but y—you have to ask the exorcist to let me go, okay?
 Are you telling the truth?
Media:vo cycop001 1903203 qianqian 10.ogg Qianqian: O—Of course... Qianqian never lies.
 I can get him out of trouble myself.
Media:vo cycop001 1903203 qianqian 11.ogg Qianqian: ...Yeah but... it'll be complicated. I've already got a plan, you must believe me!
Media:vo cycop001 1903203 qianqian 12.ogg Qianqian: So, um... What do you say?
 He'll be the one that decides, but I'll try to explain the situation as best I can.
Media:vo cycop001 1903203 qianqian 13.ogg Qianqian: Um... Uh, okay... So, I'll take that as a "yes"?
Media:vo cycop001 1903203 qianqian 14.ogg Qianqian: I hope the exorcist with blue hair is a good person.
Media:vo cycop001 1903203 qianqian 15.ogg Qianqian: Um... So, I'll help him, and you'll go talk to him. Hopefully, then he'll leave me alone... Sound good?
(Approach Chongyun)
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 zhouliang 01.ogg Zhouliang: Hey, you've been turning the whole place upside down looking for "evil spirits." Other participants are starting to complain!
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 fusaner 01.ogg Fu San'er: Yeah! Why would an exorcist show up at the Test of Courage and tell everyone that there are no ghosts here? You're just stirring up trouble!
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: Honestly, I find this whole thing quite confusing. If there really are ghosts here, then you're using them to make Mora regardless of the participants' safety. You tell me, is that ethical business practice?
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: And if there are no ghosts here, then your so-called Test of Courage is nothing but a big scam!
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: Not only are you avoiding my questions, but now you accuse me of causing trouble?
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 zhouliang 02.ogg Zhouliang: I've already told you! This is what kind of event the Test of Courage is! It's not our problem that you're taking it so seriously.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 zhouliang 03.ogg Zhouliang: And now that you're disturbing our participants, we'll have to ask you to leave.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: If anything about this made any sense at all, I would leave of my own volition.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: But if I leave now, I'm leaving evil spirits to their own devices.
 (I wonder what I should say in this situation...)
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 distantsounda 01.ogg Distant Sound: Help!!!
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 distantsoundb 01.ogg Distant Sound: G—Ghost! There's a ghost!
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 distantsoundc 01.ogg Distant Sound: Run for your life!
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 zhouliang 04.ogg Zhouliang: Wh—What's going on!?
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 fusaner 02.ogg Fu San'er: Everyone's starting to panic! I—Is there really a ghost?
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 zhouliang 05.ogg Zhouliang: Don't be silly! But if everyone starts running, someone could get hurt!
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 zhouliang 06.ogg Zhouliang: Everyone! Just calm down — no need to panic. Please move in an orderly fashion!
The staff leave in a hurry, leaving you to tell Chongyun about Qianqian's plan.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: I see... So there's no evil spirits here, just a wandering ghost.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: And she scared everyone away because I was in trouble?
 She only scared them. She didn't hurt anyone.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: If things are as you say, then she doesn't seem like a malignant spirit.
 She's a ghost, but she's also just a kid.
 I'll let you be the judge.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: ...
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: Alright... As long as she promises not to harm anyone, then I'll pretend that I never knew about her.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 11.ogg Chongyun: However, if she ever does harm anyone, it'll be my job as an exorcist to come and purge her... To mend my mistake.
 I don't think that day will ever come.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 12.ogg Chongyun: I hope so...
 I'll be equally responsible, too.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 13.ogg Chongyun: No... No, no, this is my call. I shall take full responsibility.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 14.ogg Chongyun: ...We should go now. It doesn't seem we're particularly welcome here anyway.
 ...
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 15.ogg Chongyun: ...What's wrong?
 I was under the impression that you wouldn't be willing to let Qianqian go.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 16.ogg Chongyun: I have faith in my judgment of good and evil.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 17.ogg Chongyun: But, if I begin to neglect my perception of good and evil, it may lead to something I'd regret for the rest of my days.
 This sounds just like something you would say.
 I didn't expect you to have a gentle side.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 18.ogg Chongyun: Wait, you mean... you didn't think I could be fair and reasonable?
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 19.ogg Chongyun: R—Really? Do I look so obstinate?
 It doesn't matter.
 I know you better now.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 20.ogg Chongyun: Yeah, you're right. Alright, we should leave now.
 Wait a moment.
 Let's say goodbye to Qianqian.
Media:vo cycop001 1903204 chongyun 21.ogg Chongyun: Ahh... Hmm... Okay.

The player will proceed to Ending: The Stars' Expectation after Layla's consciousness is fully-awakened (which her Stress Value is on maximum level). This ending is caused by the following scenarios:
If the player asks her relating to the quadruple-orbit shift, regardless of her Stress Value is on 4.
If the player asks her far from the topic.

Thesis Defense Practice[]

(Upon arriving at House of Deena)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 01.ogg Layla: This seems like the best spot to do this. We'll need to be quiet so we don't disturb anyone.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 02.ogg Layla: So here's what will happen during my thesis defense: after I present my thesis, the advisers sitting below will begin to ask questions.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 03.ogg Layla: Theoretically, I should be able to answer any questions related to my thesis.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 04.ogg Layla: However, I tend to get really nervous when my advisers look at me, and I end up completely forgetting what I planned to say...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 05.ogg Layla: That's why I want to rehearse and practice presenting my points in front of someone.
 So I'm playing the role of an academic adviser, right?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 06.ogg Layla: That's right. You should have gotten the gist of the content in my thesis when I was explaining it earlier. So, ask away.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 07.ogg Layla: It's okay if your questions are a little off. I'll still treat them as real questions from an adviser and answer seriously.
 Got it. You ready?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 08.ogg Layla: W—Wait a moment!
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 09.ogg Layla: *deep breaths* Alright, Layla, you got this! You were able to explain everything earlier, so you can do it again...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 10.ogg Layla: Alright, ask away.
 Can you briefly describe the application of the law of triple-orbit shift calculation?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 11.ogg Layla: Sure. The direction of this research is based on the results of previous research. It's about the feasibility of applying my methodologies to the remaining triple-orbit problems.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 12.ogg Layla: Umm... based on a sample size of 124 cases, we could only achieve approximately 60 percent accuracy. The results were not reliable enough to be implemented as a law.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 13.ogg Layla: You can see the common traits of the erroneous samples on page three... Ah, excuse me, I mean from the starlogs in the appendix.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 14.ogg Layla: It's clear that in each of the erroneous samples, one of the stars underwent a significant shift. This means that...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 15.ogg Layla: We not only need to limit the number of stars, but we may also need to consider the degree of shift when applying triple-orbit shift algorithms...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 16.ogg Layla: Stars with greater shifts are often key in astrology readings. The next step of the research should be, uh... the next step should be to identify the feasible thresholds of shift for applying our calculations.
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 Could you talk about quadruple-orbit shift?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 17.ogg Layla: Huh? Uh, um...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 18.ogg Layla: (I doubt they'd ask about something so irrelevant!)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 19.ogg Layla: The differences are considerable and the astrological effects are entirely different... We need to consider how the effects offset and, um...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 20.ogg Layla: I'm sorry, I'm not very knowledgeable in that area.

 Do you know about "The Great Machine"?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 21.ogg Layla: Huh? No, wh—what is that?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 22.ogg Layla: (Is this something that I didn't prepare for at all!? You've gotta be joking!)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 23.ogg Layla: I, um... uhh...

Branch 1[]
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 24.ogg Layla: And that's my answer to your question. D—Do you have any other questions?
Despite a few stumbles here and there, Layla successfully manages to answer all the questions.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 25.ogg Layla: Phew... we're finally done.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 26.ogg Layla: I'm gonna need more practice. I can feel myself getting flustered, and I start to stumble whenever I'm asked questions that I'm unfamiliar with.
 Your presentation could use some work, but I can tell that your logic is sound.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 27.ogg Layla: Oh, really? You mean it?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 28.ogg Layla: Hmm, then this practice must be helping. During my first thesis defense, I stood like a statue on the stage, and my palms were covered in sweat. I couldn't get a single word out.
 It seems we've managed to address all the major challenges for you.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 29.ogg Layla: I didn't even realize it, but you're right. It doesn't seem like there's anything holding me back now.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 30.ogg Layla: I guess that means I'm capable of completing the thesis all on my own...?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 31.ogg Layla: I can hardly believe it! Th—This is amazing!
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 32.ogg Layla: Oh, I'm sorry... it's just that I'm really excited. This is the first time this has happened, really! I'm so happy.
 You worked hard to reach this point. You don't need to rely on others anymore.
(Stress Value −2)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 33.ogg Layla: Hehe...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 34.ogg Layla: I'm not sure how to put this... I'm really happy about everything that's happened, but I'm also feeling a little sad.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 35.ogg Layla: I still don't know anything about the blessing from the stars. Will it never happen again since I don't need its help anymore?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 36.ogg Layla: It somehow makes me feel a little... lonely.
 Lonely?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 37.ogg Layla: Yeah, it almost makes the blessing feel like it was just a tool used for my studies, no?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 38.ogg Layla: But I would really like to discover what the blessing actually is, if I ever get the chance... I want to express my gratitude for it, or better yet, maybe we could be friends!
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 39.ogg Layla: That's basically how I feel about it... Even if I know nothing about the blessing, I could still feel its companionship all along.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 40.ogg Layla: It's almost like how you helped me — I really cherish and appreciate it. After all, it wouldn't be right to take such "blessings" for granted in our lives.
 I'm sure "it" will also be very happy to know you feel this way.
(Stress Value −1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 41.ogg Layla: That's good. I hope it's a little more satisfied with the way I am now, hehe.

Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 42.ogg Layla: Uh, about this question... I, umm...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 43.ogg Layla: I'm sorry, I'm not feeling very well. Everything is... spinning...
 Are you okay!?
(Stress Value +1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 44.ogg Layla: Ugh... Hm?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 45.ogg Layla: I'm sorry, I haven't been sleeping very well lately. I tend to get dizzy from time to time, but don't worry, I'm fine now.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 46.ogg Layla: ...
 ...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 47.ogg Layla: What's wrong?
 I'm waiting for you to answer my question.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 48.ogg Layla: Oh, sorry! Can you please repeat the question? I didn't hear you clearly just now.
 I don't think it's an issue of whether or not you heard me.
 You speak very differently from the Layla I know.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 49.ogg Layla: *sigh* Alright, I guess the cat's out of the bag. Of all the times to wake up...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 50.ogg Layla: You're Layla's friend, right? And from the looks of things, the two of you are preparing for her thesis defense?
 Yep. And you must be the "blessing from the stars."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 51.ogg Layla: With her long-term sleep deprivation, whenever her anxiety peaks, she loses consciousness and I take over.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 52.ogg Layla: However, her unpredictable and varying sleep patterns are completely out of my control, so I have to make every second count.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 53.ogg Layla: There's no one willing to help her here, so I have to step in.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 54.ogg Layla: I am rather curious about you, though. Why are you trying to help her?
 Well, she's finally decided to face the problems with her thesis head-on, and she's working very hard on it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 55.ogg Layla: Really? That's great. You're helping with all the things that I used to do for her.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 56.ogg Layla: Seems like you've given her a boost of confidence with your encouragement.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915902 layla 57.ogg Layla: Now, then... I can't really help her prepare for the thesis defense, so I'll be leaving some notes behind instead. You'll have to give them to her later.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 01.ogg Layla: Okay, I should get started on those notes. If there's anything you're curious about, you may go ahead and ask now. I can answer you as I write! I'm used to multi-tasking.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 02.ogg Layla: Oh, and I have to ask a favor. When you give the notes to her later, please don't tell her about my existence.
 Why's that?
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 03.ogg Layla: Hmm, well, she's always been in a fragile state. If she knew that there was another "Layla" who's always taking care of everything...
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 04.ogg Layla: She might feel like everything she's ever worked for is pointless, and that could lead to some demoralizing thoughts.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 05.ogg Layla: She's a resilient girl, but no matter how resilient she may be, no one can hold up to criticism and torment from themselves.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 06.ogg Layla: If her condition grows any worse, it's possible that I might cease to exist as well. Then there wouldn't be anyone to help her.
 But she's not doing very well now, either.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 07.ogg Layla: She's getting better, though, isn't she? It's apparent how hard she's working now.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 08.ogg Layla: She's my source of knowledge. I'm merely the representation of how she would be if she were rested and healthy.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 09.ogg Layla: I believe that she's one of the best, even in a place like the Akademiya, where geniuses come by the handful.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 10.ogg Layla: But growth is a process and shouldn't be rushed. I will always believe in and support her.
 It's good that she has you, or she might've already hit rock bottom.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 11.ogg Layla: Hahaha, believe me, even if she were to end up at rock bottom, she'd find a way to somehow laugh it off as one of her silly mistakes and climb her way out.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 12.ogg Layla: That's the kind of person she is.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 13.ogg Layla: Alright, I've written down all the possible questions that I think the advisers might ask. Next, I'll put together a few words of encouragement for her.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 14.ogg Layla: I'm not going to sign it, obviously. Oh, and don't forget about our agreement.

The Wisdom Seelie[]

(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Rabah, optional)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 rabah 09.ogg Rabah: (She probably won't hear back in time.)
(Ask Rabah about the legend)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 layla 01.ogg Layla: Excuse me, have you ever heard of the Wisdom Seelie?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 rabah 01.ogg Rabah: Heh, you've come to the right person.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 rabah 02.ogg Rabah: I came across this legend not too long ago myself. After hearing about it, I decided to test it out and asked it a question about the brightness of the stars.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 rabah 03.ogg Rabah: Two days later, I got a response. It included two pages of detailed and accurate information. It saved me from having to look up a ton of resources.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 layla 02.ogg Layla: R—Really?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 rabah 04.ogg Rabah: Yeah, so I submitted another question a few days ago. I still haven't received a reply, though.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 layla 03.ogg Layla: That sounds like what others have said. But I don't have the time to wait for a reply if the Seelie doesn't answer right away...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 layla 04.ogg Layla: Ahh, whatever. Can you please tell me how to submit a question to the Wisdom Seelie?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 rabah 05.ogg Rabah: It's quite simple. Go to the bookshelf over there and find either "Theoretical Astrology" or "A Quick Reference Guide to Astrology Cases."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 layla 05.ogg Layla: Oh, I know where those are... My Darshan has us use those two books quite often.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 rabah 06.ogg Rabah: Okay, so write your question in a letter addressed to the Wisdom Seelie, and then insert the letter into one of the books.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 rabah 07.ogg Rabah: Come back in a day or two, and if you see a red stamp on your letter, that means the Wisdom Seelie has replied.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 rabah 08.ogg Rabah: However, if the stamp never appears, then that means the Seelie doesn't want to answer your question.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 layla 06.ogg Layla: I see. Thank you so much.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 layla 07.ogg Layla: I'm gonna go write down my question. Hopefully the Seelie replies...
(Talk to Rabah again)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915101 rabah 10.ogg Rabah: There's no harm in trying. Now let's see if it's in the mood to answer your question.

Dislocated Dialogue[]

(Head over to the bookshelf Rabah mentioned)
Layla places her letter in the designated book.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 01.ogg Layla: Whew, finally... I wrote out my question and put it in the book.
 What do we do now?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 02.ogg Layla: Wait, I guess. Let's give it some time.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 03.ogg Layla: I'll come back tomorrow to check on it. Don't worry about me if you have other things to do.
 I'll come with you. I'm a little worried.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 04.ogg Layla: I see... Thanks, I appreciate it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 05.ogg Layla: Alright then, let's meet up here tomorrow. I really hope the Seelie replies.
The next day, you and Layla return to the same bookshelf.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 06.ogg Layla: Time to look at the letter. Please let there be a stamp, please let there be a stamp...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 07.ogg Layla: Ah, there's a red stamp on it! The Seelie responded! Fantastic!
 You look better already.
 Your eyes are sparkling.
(Stress Value −1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 08.ogg Layla: This is wonderful. My troubles are at an end! I can't even begin to express how grateful I am.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 09.ogg Layla: Let's take a look at what it wrote...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 10.ogg Layla: "Thank you for your letter. Though I have extended a response, I cannot answer your query due to your questionable motives."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 11.ogg Layla: Questionable motives? ...Me? W—Wait, huh?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 12.ogg Layla: Okay, let's see... "Completing a thesis requires independent thought and work. You planned on using my knowledge to complete your paper's most critical portions. That's not right."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 13.ogg Layla: "However, considering that your deadline is fast approaching, and that there is substance to the content in the completed sections of your thesis, I've decided to help you nonetheless."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 14.ogg Layla: "Follow the hints I've left, and you will find the answer to your question."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 15.ogg Layla: "Consider the effort you put into thinking and searching as your payment for my knowledge."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 16.ogg Layla: What the...
(Stress Value +1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 17.ogg Layla: It's absolutely right about everything... I'm starting to feel guilty now, I can't deny any of it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 18.ogg Layla: But I'm running out of time... Oh, what should I do...?
 I'll search for the answer with you. (This dialogue option leads to Further Investigation.)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 19.ogg Layla: Huh? Uh...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 20.ogg Layla: I could tell you're a very kind person, but I never expected that you'd go this far to help me...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 21.ogg Layla: I'll definitely think of a way to make it up to you once I take care of my thesis.
 Don't worry about it.
 Just another day in the life of an adventurer.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 22.ogg Layla: Okay, let's start by looking at the hint it left us. It should be on the second page.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 23.ogg Layla: "The first clue lies hidden on the road of wisdom. The headstrong child finally sees the world for how big it truly is, filled with awe, yet struck with fear."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 24.ogg Layla: That's it? Not even a picture or any other marking to go off of... This is pretty abstract.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 25.ogg Layla: What's this road of wisdom, and who's the child?
 "Wisdom" is probably referring to the Akademiya?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 26.ogg Layla: Hmm, possibly. That sounds like a natural conclusion. So, is the road of wisdom the road that leads to the Akademiya then?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 27.ogg Layla: Wait, I think I get what it means by the "child" and "awe and fear"...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 28.ogg Layla: When I first left home, it took me days to reach Sumeru City. I was completely shocked when I first saw it with my own eyes.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 29.ogg Layla: It was so grand and awe-inspiring... Pictures of the city simply don't do it any justice.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 30.ogg Layla: After seeing the city, a thought popped into my head: "Am I really worthy of this place?"
 And that's the "fear"?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 31.ogg Layla: Worry, fear, or whatever you want to call it. Hmm, if I'm connecting the dots correctly, then I think I know where the Seelie is leading us.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 32.ogg Layla: But, how does it know my feelings so well?
 Maybe it wasn't referring to you specifically.
 People who come to Sumeru City from elsewhere might often have similar feelings.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 33.ogg Layla: You have a point. There's nothing special about my background or experiences. It could be anyone's...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 34.ogg Layla: Anyway, let's go take a look!
(Proceed to Further Investigation)
 It might be messing with you. (This dialogue option leads to Taking the Opposite Route.)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 35.ogg Layla: Hmm, good point. Why else would it use such a roundabout way to tell me its answer?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 36.ogg Layla: Supposedly, everyone who's been pranked by the Seelie had angered it in some way...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 37.ogg Layla: That means the Seelie is someone who's very strict and serious about knowledge... but who knows if it's really a Seelie or some person.
 The main issue is that you have a deadline to meet.
 There's no guarantee that you'll actually get an answer, even after doing what it says.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 38.ogg Layla: True... And if I don't get an answer, then I'll only have wasted more time.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 39.ogg Layla: *sigh* But there's nothing else we can do. It's the one holding all the cards... It's completely hidden and can choose whether to help us or not.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 40.ogg Layla: After all, it'd probably be impossible to find it and ask my question in person...
 Now that sounds like an idea.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 41.ogg Layla: Huh? I was just kidding... Please don't take me seriously.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 42.ogg Layla: It's a Seelie we're talking about. According to legend, Seelies are elusive and can create countless copies of themselves... Who's to say that it won't summon a shooting star to crush us once we find it?
 You don't actually believe in those legends, do you...?
 Think about what you just said for a moment.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 43.ogg Layla: S—Sorry... I'm just a little panicky...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 44.ogg Layla: Okay, Layla, calm down and think... If the Seelie is a person, then there has to be a way to track them down.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 45.ogg Layla: We have two possible leads right now. The first is the checkout logs of those two books, and the other is the red stamp.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 46.ogg Layla: The red stamp bears the Rtawahist emblem, which is used by a lot of people. It'll be hard to track down an individual, so we should probably start with the checkout logs.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915103 layla 47.ogg Layla: Let's go and make an inquiry. We can also ask around the House of Daena and see if anyone else knows something about the Wisdom Seelie.
(Proceed to Taking the Opposite Route)

 Quest DescriptionYou run into Kaveh on the streets of Sumeru City. He seems to be embroiled in an argument with a client...
Commissioner Quarrel[]

(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Kaveh, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19058 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: (Ugh, just my luck... Why does this happen to me?)
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Badawi, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19058 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: (If only I didn't fall for that scam last time...)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: I've taken a look at your proposal. It's much better than the ones you showed me before, but I'd still like to make some changes...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: ...Come on, not again? Isn't this the sixth proposal I've shown you? What's your issue this time?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 02.ogg Badawi: Hmm... It's a bit hard to put into words, but the design still doesn't look quite right to me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: I have to say, that's a terribly vague and unconvincing explanation. Please enlighten me — what would feel more "right" to you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 03.ogg Badawi: Hmm, for starters, don't you think this roof is jutting out a bit too far from the top? It looks almost like the head of a fungus.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 04.ogg Badawi: This door, too — I don't think it needs to be nearly this large. If you could reduce it to around my height, you could use the leftover materials to construct a few more rooms—
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: I... *deep breath* The roof and the door are the most fundamental parts of a building. If we were to change them, then what would be left of the design!?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Even if the soul of the building won't be lost, all traces of architectural style would be gone. Anyone with the slightest inkling of architectural knowledge would know to leave them alone!
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 05.ogg Badawi: Oh, I understand the principles of what you are saying, of course, but the truth remains that I'm still a bit unhappy with this design as-is. Is there anything else that you can do?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 06.ogg Badawi: Ah, actually, I just got an idea. Can we get rid of all the extraneous sections on the roof, so the whole design will just be one vertical structure, similar to that of a tree trunk?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: ...What!?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 07.ogg Badawi: Don't architects often say that symmetry makes everything more balanced and pleasing to the eye? This way, the proportions will be completely balanced.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: I... I really don't know how you managed to come up with such a ridiculous idea. Wait, don't tell me... Someone hired you specifically to commission me and put me through the wringer? Come to think of it, though, I really don't think I've gotten on anyone's bad side recently...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Anyway, that's it, I will not be working on this commission anymore. Goodbye! Maybe you can find yourself some other genius who'll be able to satisfy your demands.
(−3 Hearts)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 08.ogg Badawi: Hey, young man, please wait!... *sigh*
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Kaveh looks like he's in a bad mood. I should go check up on him.)
(Talk to Badawi again, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905802 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: *sigh*... Were my requests out of line?

Tavern Heart-to-Heart[]

Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Taking this commission was truly the worst decision ever...
 Are you all right?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Hmm? Oh, hey, I wasn't expecting to run into you here.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: Actually, while we're on that, what are you doing here at the tavern? Don't listen to anyone who says that drinking is an elegant pastime. It's no good for your health.
 I followed you here.
 I saw you arguing with someone just now...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Uh... So you saw all that, did you? Ugh, I thought I was in the clear — I made sure to double check that nobody I knew was around...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: Ahem... Anyway, thanks for looking out for me. Honestly, it wasn't that big of a deal. I'm used to it by now.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Stress is just an inescapable part of being a working adult. Boss! I'll have a glass of wine — same as last time.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Do you want something, too? I'll put it on my tab.
 I'll have a glass of juice.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 lambad 01.ogg Lambad: Wine and a glass of juice, coming right up.
Kaveh chugs down his entire glass of wine...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: I know you're already keeping a secret for me, but if you could add this one to the list as well, I'd really appreciate it. Arguing with a client is not a good look for me... If word gets out, other potential clients might be afraid to work with me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: That guy, though... What was he even going on about!? All those ridiculous demands of his... he's just a blabbering fool trying to act like a know-it-all!
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Kaveh seems a lot more honest after he's had some wine...)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: Another glass, please, Boss! I'm not leaving today 'til someone has to carry me out!
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 lambad 02.ogg Lambad: You've got it, sir! Haha. Gotta say though, it almost feels like you're saying that every other day now...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: It really is every other day that you'd run into a client who knows nothing about construction requirements or architectural style. If this was in the past, I'd never have gone through six whole drafts trying to accommodate the client's preferences.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: But perhaps getting "used" to this just means that I've grown "numb" to it. I've worked on so many projects since graduation, and none of them have been approved at the first pass...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: I would spend a lot of time altering my designs, and by the time the clients were finally satisfied, all my passion and enthusiasm would be gone. It feels like I'm straying further and further from my artistic vision with every change I have to make.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: I suppose, though, that just sticking to your guns and completely disregarding other people's feedback would also not be a good thing.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: All of this makes for a real paradox, one that particularly crops up in my work, too. In the end, what is the true meaning of art? Should I see it as a divine gift of inspiration from the gods, or an expression of the light of my own wisdom?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 lambad 03.ogg Lambad: Here's your drink. How are you already spouting nonsense after just one glass? Your tolerance is usually much better than that.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: Boss, what do you think is the meaning of art?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 lambad 04.ogg Lambad: The meaning of art? Really, my friend, who in Sumeru understands art better than you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 lambad 05.ogg Lambad: Anyway, I dunno about art, but I do know that I'm interested in business, and some patrons are waiting to be served. So you'll have to excuse me for now... Just holler if you need anything.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: ...What do you think, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 I honestly have no idea...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 24.ogg Kaveh: No worries. It was just an offhand question.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 25.ogg Kaveh: It's been bothering me for a while. Even when I'm awake, the question haunts me like a bad dream. I still haven't found a good answer to it... or maybe, there was never a correct answer in the first place.
 Art is something that resonates with the masses?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: Yes, art shouldn't be self-indulgent entertainment saved for the elite.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: Let's say that I built a house for someone. If they don't like how it looks, then no matter how brilliant it may appear to me, they won't be happy with it.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 20.ogg Kaveh: The problem is that it can be very difficult to get validated by others. I could compromise my personal standards to accommodate my clients, but often, that'd just mean creating a final product that I would struggle to look at.
 Something that embodies the creator's efforts and dedication?
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 21.ogg Kaveh: Exactly. So our thoughts on the meaning of art are rather similar.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 22.ogg Kaveh: In Sumeru, and especially Sumeru of the past, the arts are not a popular discussion topic. Trying to talk about the arts is basically the key to killing any conversation.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 23.ogg Kaveh: It's too bad that I'm not in my best form today... Otherwise, we could have talked about this for a little longer.
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Kaveh still looks dejected, and even the wine didn't help his mood. How can I help cheer him up?)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Hmm, maybe I should play it safe and just make a simple suggestion...)
 I'll help you convince the client to come to your side. (This dialogue option leads to Searching for the Commissioner.)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 26.ogg Kaveh: Hmm? Ah, thanks for offering, but you've seen how he is... He's not going to listen to anything I say.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 27.ogg Kaveh: He understands nothing about my design, and all the suggestions he made were as if he just wanted to mock me.
 I don't think he was intentionally trying to be difficult.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 28.ogg Kaveh: ...Okay, it is possible that I was just jaded by my frustration.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 29.ogg Kaveh: Well, given I'm already on my sixth draft, I can probably push myself to make a seventh... Let's go have another talk with him. I know where we'd be able to find the guy.
 If you can convince even him to see your point of view...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 30.ogg Kaveh: You mean... If I manage to get him to see things my way, then this project would also gain recognition from many people?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 31.ogg Kaveh: Hmm... you've got a point. Let's hear him out one more time, then.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 32.ogg Kaveh: Time to get going. I know where we'd be able to find the guy.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 33.ogg Kaveh: There's no time to waste... The wine can wait until another time. I'll go take care of the bill.
(Go to Searching for the Commissioner)
 Let's do something else and clear your mind.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 34.ogg Kaveh: Sounds great to me! I don't even want to think about this project anymore. But what should we do? It's probably not a good idea to just drink until I pass out here...
 Why did you decide to become an architect? (This dialogue option leads to A Dear Memento.)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 35.ogg Kaveh: Huh? Where did that come from...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 36.ogg Kaveh: I mean, it's not like it's some kind of secret. You probably already know some bits and pieces of my past.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 37.ogg Kaveh: My mother is also an architect. I've always adored her drawings, and when I was young, I used to sit next to her and watch her bring all kinds of buildings to life on paper. You could say my interest in architecture just naturally grew with time.
 Would she be able to understand how you're feeling right now?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 38.ogg Kaveh: Perhaps. In fact, I have also seen my mother argue with her clients... But she would always quickly find the motivation to return to her work.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 39.ogg Kaveh: Unfortunately, I've barely had any contact with her since she remarried and moved abroad... Even if I wanted to ask her about her ability to stay positive after an argument, it would seem rude to barge into her life again over something as trivial as that.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 40.ogg Kaveh: I did remember something else, though. When my mother left, she only carried some small personal luggage with her. She left most of the belongings in the house to me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 41.ogg Kaveh: At the time she even told me that it would be great if I could learn a few lessons from her life experiences, so my life and career could go a little more smoothly.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 42.ogg Kaveh: I hadn't quite come to grips with my emotions, and didn't really have it in me to go through any sentimental items, so I just packed anything with memories away in a box, and haven't reopened it since.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 43.ogg Kaveh: It's been a really long time... Now that so many years have passed, maybe I have finally developed the maturity I need to face those memories without losing my mind. Yeah... I should dig it out and take a look.
 Um... Do you think I can come with you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 44.ogg Kaveh: Huh? Ah... Sorry, I've had too much to drink and wasn't thinking clearly. You're right... I should do these kinds of things with the support of a friend.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 45.ogg Kaveh: Uh... speaking of that... I can call you a friend now, right...?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 46.ogg Kaveh: Either way, thanks for reminding me that I can invite you to come along. Had I just gone back by myself, it would have looked like I'm deliberately trying to keep things from you.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 47.ogg Kaveh: Ugh, thinking too hard about the words is giving me a headache, so I'll just give it to you straight. Ahem. Thanks to your advice, I have decided to put my current projects on pause for now, and spend some time trying to rekindle the passion for my craft.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 48.ogg Kaveh: If you want to stick around and see how this will turn out, you'll be sure to encounter some bits and pieces of my past. Do you think you'd find that too boring?
 I don't think so.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 49.ogg Kaveh: Alright, then let's head back together. I mean, you already know where I live...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 50.ogg Kaveh: Hah, who knew that the day would come when I, too, would have some friends over.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 51.ogg Kaveh: Let me see... I should have tidied up the place before I left the house this morning. Alhaitham shouldn't be home now, either — he's usually in the records room at this time of the day.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 52.ogg Kaveh: Anyway, there's no more time for drinks. I'll go take care of the bill.
(Go to A Dear Memento)
 How about looking into another career? (This dialogue option leads to Educational Organization.)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 53.ogg Kaveh: A different career... I see, that's not a bad idea.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 54.ogg Kaveh: I think I've heard a saying somewhere before — eighty percent of a working adult's woes are due to not having enough Mora in the bank.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 55.ogg Kaveh: It's just a saying, of course, but even I will admit that my life would be a lot better if I could make additional Mora.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 56.ogg Kaveh: And if I want to make Mora, I should finish that ridiculous commission... But I really can't find it in me to go back and talk to him right now.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 57.ogg Kaveh: Hold on! I just remembered that I used to have a senior classmate by the name of Alkami. If memory serves me right, he's no longer taking private commissions, but he's still doing pretty well for himself.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 58.ogg Kaveh: Maybe I'll be able to get some advice from him... Yeah, I should get on this right away! No more wine for me today — I'll grab the bill and be on my way.

 Quest DescriptionKaveh mentioned a Kshahrewar senior of his who has somehow struck gold without taking any personal commissions. You resolve to ask him for some career tips.
Educational Organization[]

(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Alkami, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19078 alkami 01.ogg Alkami: (I need to find a new way to attract students...)
(Talk to Alkami)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 01.ogg Alkami: Ah, Kaveh, it's you! It's been a while — what have you been up to recently?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Yeah, it's been a long time, Alkami. Things haven't changed much for me. I'm still taking private commissions for all kinds of projects.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 02.ogg Alkami: I heard that you were the genius behind the Palace of Alcazarzaray? I bet you're set for Mora after a project of that size?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Uhh... Well, it's hard to make a profit from every project, you know...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 03.ogg Alkami: Hard to make a profit? Haha, you've gotta be joking! I've never met an architect who didn't make a profit from a project.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 04.ogg Alkami: Unless... the client fled before they paid the commission fee in full? But that doesn't sound right, either... Doesn't Dori have a pretty decent reputation in our local business circles? I don't think she's ever been involved in any kind of big scandal...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: Well, about that... I mean, it was complicated...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 05.ogg Alkami: I understand. Either way, doing one project after another sure gets exhausting over the years, eh? I've been there, so I can feel your pain.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 06.ogg Alkami: I mean, I obviously never had your reputation to live up to. That must've been stressful. But I'm sure we faced all the same problems: Trying to keep your client in a good mood while you're trying to stop them from micromanaging things they don't know the first thing about... Heh, I don't miss it. Thankfully, that's all behind me now.
 Did you start a new career?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 07.ogg Alkami: Hmm... not exactly. My work is still closely related to architecture.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 08.ogg Alkami: Judging from the look on your face, you're still strapped for Mora. That's quite unfortunate. You're the most artistically gifted graduate the Kshahrewar Darshan has seen in decades, but it looks like you still have a lot to learn in terms of making Mora.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 09.ogg Alkami: With that said, us Kshahrewar grads should still look out for each other. Hmm... what if I told you about an idea that'll absolve you of all your Mora troubles going forward?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Are you serious? But something like that has got to be some kind of top-level business secret. Are you sure you can just share something like that with me?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: Besides, I don't want to just take something like that without offering anything in return. I still have a little Mora... Or is there something that I can help you with?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 10.ogg Alkami: Haha, you're too kind. This is just a simple tip. Even if I didn't bring it up, I'm sure you'd hear it from the others sooner or later. The idea is this: I recently opened up a training center with the goal of educating people in architecture design.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 11.ogg Alkami: Compared to the classes taught by those old fossils at the Akademiya, my classes are more condensed and streamlined, and will allow people to quickly get their foot in the door.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 12.ogg Alkami: Unlike the Akademiya, I won't turn down anyone who's interested, rich or poor. As long as someone wishes to learn more about architecture, I'll accept them into my training center.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 13.ogg Alkami: It just so happens that I'm still looking for a few more instructors. So, what do you say? Interested in coming over to give a few lectures?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 14.ogg Alkami: Regardless of the pay, I already can guarantee that it'll be far more comfortable than working on random people's private commissions.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Ah, so you want me to join you as an instructor. Hmm, that does sound like something I'd be able to do. Sounds like a pretty stable job, too...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: What do you think, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 At least you won't have to deal with clients anymore.
 I think you can give it a go.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 15.ogg Alkami: Then, it's a deal?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: Yes, it's a deal. Thank you, Alkami.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 16.ogg Alkami: Haha, like I said, there's no need to thank me for this. The lecture room is not far from here, so you can just come straight here tomorrow morning.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 17.ogg Alkami: As for the pay... How about we start at three hundred thousand Mora per lecture?
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: Three hundred thousand!? Are you serious? How could you offer so much?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 18.ogg Alkami: Haha, it would seem that you're still oblivious to your own economic worth. Three hundred thousand is nothing compared to the prestige of having the Light of Kshahrewar as one of my instructors.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 19.ogg Alkami: Three hundred thousand is also just the base rate. Just trust me on this, the longer you stick with me, the more you'll come to understand your true value in the market.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 alkami 20.ogg Alkami: I have to go make some preparations now... See you tomorrow.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: I was never particularly close with Alkami when we were in school. Who would have thought that he'd be so nice and friendly?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: I've hosted free lectures before, but this would be my first time being hired to lecture for a formal business. Three hundred thousand Mora per lecture... Whew, I'm so excited that I'm starting to get nervous.
 I'll join you for the lecture.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: Thanks so much. *sigh* I think I will be able to relax a bit more with a friend in the audience.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: Now, what should I talk about tomorrow? Some lessons I've learned over the past few years? Hmm, I should probably save those for later... for my first lecture, I should start by getting them more interested in the field...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907801 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: Alright, let's meet here again tomorrow morning. I should hurry home and create some kind of lesson plan. If I'm going to become an instructor, I should make sure I show up prepared.

(Approach Alkami)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907803 alkami 01.ogg Alkami: Oh, I didn't expect you two to get here so early.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907803 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: I was up last night preparing for the lecture, but I ended up getting so excited that I couldn't fall asleep. Here, I've prepared a lesson plan — do you want to take a look?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907803 alkami 02.ogg Alkami: Lesson plan? Ah... I must commend you for your dedication.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907803 alkami 03.ogg Alkami: But the training center has already developed its own set of teaching materials. Instead of using your own plan, you can just use what we have here. Of course, you're always welcome to work in some of your own content to add more fun and flavor.
 Can I take a look at your materials?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907803 alkami 04.ogg Alkami: Sure, be my guest.
Read Teaching Materials: (The materials cover a variety of architectural knowledge. At first glance, nothing appears to be amiss.)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907803 alkami 05.ogg Alkami: It's almost time for the lecture to start. Feel free to head in and start the class whenever you're ready.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907803 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Huh, so you've already developed your own set of teaching materials... Seems like I won't need the stuff I've prepared after all. Anyway, shouldn't be a problem, I'll just go ahead and use your materials.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907803 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: There's something else I want to ask, though... This isn't going to be a large class, is it?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907803 alkami 06.ogg Alkami: Ah, no need to stress. There are only twenty people in this class.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907803 alkami 07.ogg Alkami: There are fourteen classes at my training center. Out of all of them, the first class has the best grades, so I've directed them to you. We'll see how well they will take to your lectures.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907803 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Twenty people, huh... Alright, I think I can handle that.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907803 alkami 08.ogg Alkami: Oh, and one last thing: in the interest of keeping a quiet learning space, only instructors and students are allowed in the classroom when class is in session.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907803 alkami 09.ogg Alkami: I'm sorry to say this, but your friend will have to wait outside while you teach the class.
 It's okay, I was thinking about taking a walk anyway.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907803 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: Ah, sorry about that. I'll meet you at the door when the class is over then.

 Do you know a man by the name of Alkami?
 I'm wondering if you know anything about Alkami.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907804 adan 02.ogg Adan: Oh, Alkami? You mean that rich guy who's been making quite the name for himself? Yeah, he commissioned a set of furniture from me a while back. Paid a great deal of Mora for it, too.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907804 adan 03.ogg Adan: I heard he earned a fortune working as a renowned architect. Now he's opened a training center so others can follow in his footsteps.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907804 adan 04.ogg Adan: If the tuition wasn't sky-high, I'd enroll my child in a heartbeat. Architecture really sounds like a lucrative profession...
(Talk to Aabid or Adil)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907808 aabid 01.ogg Aabid: Did you hear? Alkami recruited Kaveh to be an instructor!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907808 adil 01.ogg Adil: Heh, I bet that'll boost his enrollment numbers!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907808 aabid 02.ogg Aabid: Really makes you jealous, eh? If you think about it, Alkami was never that talented himself as an architect. If we're just talking about professional skill, no one would pay for a class with him.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907808 adil 02.ogg Adil: That's true, but you've got to admit, his advertisements are really effective... After all, the Akademiya only admits those that can pass its entrance exam, so only a few people could hope to study architecture in the halls of the Kshahrewar.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907808 adil 03.ogg Adil: For those who can't pass the exam, or who just want to jump straight into the industry, the training center is the best bang for the Mora.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907808 aabid 03.ogg Aabid: Man, to have that kind of business acumen...
Before long, Kaveh's class is over...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Alright, everyone, there's no need to be nervous.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Class is over, so we can just chat for a bit. I shouldn't have lost my temper during the lecture — did I scare anybody?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 uzayr 01.ogg Uzayr: No, you weren't scary at all, Mr. Kaveh... W—We were just a bit lost and didn't get what you were talking about...
 Did something happen, Kaveh?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: Ugh, don't get me started. I was trying to use Alkami's materials, so I flipped through some pages and gave them a closer look... The more I read, the more upset I became.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Alkami may fool an amateur, but he can't fool anyone who's active in our profession. The materials he made are completely useless for teaching real architecture!
 Why do you say that?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: In my opinion, the most important skill of an architect is their ability to craft a design. In other words, they must be able to conceptualize ideas.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: There are tens of thousands of buildings in the world, as well as a countless number of architectural styles. Some designs emphasize aesthetics, while others prioritize practicality.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: The architects who can critically evaluate the quality and fit of different designs are those who can come up with great designs of their own. But you won't get any of that from the teaching materials they're using here.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: All these students are doing in class is rote memorization of existing designs. They are learning nothing about the underlying principles.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: How can they expect to become real architects? When they're done with this class, all they'll become are dilettantes with a pitiful smattering of architectural knowledge.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 waiz 01.ogg Waiz: B—But Mr. Kaveh, we didn't really understand anything you said after you threw away the materials, either...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 waiz 02.ogg Waiz: What's the big deal anyway? It's not like we're looking to make some works of art... we just want to make some Mora.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: You're studying architecture to make Mora?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 tanisha 01.ogg Tanisha: Yeah! Why else would we be studying here?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 tanisha 02.ogg Tanisha: My biggest dream is to become someone like Mr. Alkami. Once I finally make my fortune in architecture, I'll be able to buy anything I like!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: ...In that case, I'm afraid you'll probably be disappointed. The reality is that the work of an architect is very difficult, and the pay is not lucrative at all. Believe me, I'm a perfect example.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 waiz 03.ogg Waiz: But how? Mr. Alkami just told us last night that you made a killing by building the Palace of Alcazarzaray!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 waiz 04.ogg Waiz: He also said that as long as we graduate from his class, waves upon waves of people will reach out to us with private commissions, and we can just sit back and wait for Mora to fill up our pockets.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 waiz 05.ogg Waiz: It won't be long before I can put these miserable days behind me...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: Come on... and you all believed everything he said?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 uzayr 02.ogg Uzayr: But Mr. Alkami is really rich, isn't he?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: You... Hmph, it's pointless trying to argue this with you right now. You've already filled your heads with pipe dreams.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907805 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: Let's go, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Let's hear about Alkami's true plans from the man himself!

 Step DescriptionAccording to Kaveh, Alkami's training is woefully inadequate for the purposes of helping the students become qualified architects. The next step is to go with Kaveh and confront Alkami face-to-face.

(Talk to Uzayr, Tanisha, or Waiz, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 uzayr 01.ogg Uzayr: Mr. Kaveh looked really angry...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 waiz 01.ogg Waiz: Who cares about him? Maybe he's just worried that we'll take all of his commissions once we finally graduate!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 tanisha 01.ogg Tanisha: B—But that can't be it, right? Mr. Kaveh is super famous...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 waiz 02.ogg Waiz: Who knows? My dad told me that the more famous someone is, the more arrogant and stubborn they become. Approachable people like Mr. Alkami are the rare ones!
(Talk to Alkami)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 01.ogg Alkami: What's wrong, Kaveh? You look quite flustered. Did one of my students offend you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 02.ogg Alkami: Were the students not astute enough for your liking? I must implore you to go a bit easier on them. After all, they're nothing like the genius scholars you're used to dealing with at the Akademiya. We don't need to strive for perfect understanding... as long as some knowledge has been passed on, that's good enough.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Yeah, I'm mad at them, but I'm even more upset that you're scamming people under the guise of teaching them about architecture!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: The students are all here hoping for a quick way to make money, but we both know that an architect's life is hard and exhausting. Just a little while ago, I was toiling over the sixth draft of a design for a client.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: If your client is unhappy, you can't break ground, and the longer a project goes, the longer it takes for you to get paid in full. What's worse, if your client disappears in the middle of a project, good luck getting anything from them ever again!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: You know all of this just as well as I do. Why lie to them?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 03.ogg Alkami: *sigh*... Look, Kaveh, you may be the Light of Kshahrewar, but like I said, you still have a lot to learn about making Mora.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 04.ogg Alkami: You may deny it all you want, but it's a fact that in today's Sumeru, architecture is a terrible profession.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 05.ogg Alkami: Our clients care very little for the effort we pour into our designs. Instead of appreciating us, they spend all their time nitpicking details and demanding changes, often forcing all kinds of ridiculous ideas onto us.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: ...I suppose that's more or less true. Go on.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 06.ogg Alkami: Why should we cling onto a profession that's difficult and unrewarding? If the field is dying, then a person who still wants to make a good living will just have to change their strategy.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 07.ogg Alkami: If it's near-impossible to make money as an architect, then why not just establish a training center, and train other people to become architects in our stead?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Wait, how does that make any sense? Aren't you just leading them into the same trap?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 08.ogg Alkami: We are already stuck, my friend. The more people we can lead into this pit and stack as padding beneath our feet, the more comfortable our lives will be.
 So... instead of making money from architecture, you made your money from your students?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 09.ogg Alkami: That's right. Making money as an architect is a slow and agonizing process. In comparison, earning tuition from a training center is far easier.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 10.ogg Alkami: None of the students will ever know, however. In their eyes, all of my income was earned during my years as an architect. It's easy for them to fall for my promise. After all, everyone wants to live the dream of being the person who can spend millions without batting an eye.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 11.ogg Alkami: The more students I get, the more money I earn, and the more real that dream becomes.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: And then what? Once they graduate, they'll still find out the truth about architecture, and struggle to stay afloat amid all the problems we already talked about.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: When that happens, your facade will pop like a soap bubble. No one will believe you anymore!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 12.ogg Alkami: Ah, but that's just one way to look at the problem. No two people have the same amount of talent. Even if they fail to strike gold in the future, you can't say that it's my fault and mine alone.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 13.ogg Alkami: Oh, and also, I never actually promised that they would achieve financial freedom as long as they become architects. All I did was nudge them towards that belief.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 14.ogg Alkami: I'm not even scared if they do come back and stir up trouble. My training center has all the required permits and certifications. Even the Dendro Archon herself couldn't find fault in any part of my business.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: You... How can you sleep at night knowing that you're doing all this? Tell me, is your heart carved out of brick and stone?
(-2 Hearts)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: I can't believe that I once saw you as a decent human being. I... I am beyond disappointed in you!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 15.ogg Alkami: And the same goes to you. How many years has it been since you graduated from the Akademiya? If you still can't accept something like this... do you just plan on keeping that worthless naivete of yours until the end of time?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 16.ogg Alkami: Only fools will see art as revered and sacred. In the end, art is just another business. Being successful at running a business is an art form in itself.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 17.ogg Alkami: I urge you to think about what I've said. Offloading your pain onto others is the only way a person can live comfortably in this world.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 18.ogg Alkami: As the light of the Kshahrewar, you've accumulated plenty of fame and respect. It's high time that you use those resources to improve the circumstances of your own life.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 alkami 19.ogg Alkami: Think it over, Kaveh. I still believe our collaboration could be very fruitful.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: ...
 He's gone.
 What do you plan to do next?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: ...I'm so mad, I feel a headache coming on. There's nothing more I can say to him. I'll resign from my position as instructor.
 You'll give up the Mora?
(-1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: Of course. I'm sure you've realized that as long as I remained at this center, he would be able to use my name to advertise this place. Even if I just sit back and do nothing, others will be deceived and suffer because of me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: He is right about one thing, though... these kinds of training centers are everywhere, and even if the Akademiya was to find out about it, it's unlikely that they would take any real action against it.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: The most that they could accuse him of is false advertising... And even that would be hard to prove.
 There's something strange about all of this.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: Oh? Did you notice something else?
 Some of the students didn't appear to be very wealthy.
 Not everyone should be able to pay such exorbitant tuition fees.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: ...Yeah, you've got a point.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: The rate he gave me was three hundred thousand Mora per lecture. That probably came out of the students' tuition... and who knows just how much he's been charging the students for attending his classes.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: If you're gambling everything on making it rich as an architect, are you really going to have the Mora to pay for that kind of tuition?
 We can try asking the students.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 20.ogg Kaveh: Right. We should hurry, the students didn't believe a word I was telling them... They're still daydreaming about making millions.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907806 kaveh 21.ogg Kaveh: We're never going to get any information from them again if we let Alkami talk to them first. Let's move now, before he's had the chance to react!

 Step DescriptionAlkami revealed his true thoughts, and claimed that though he does not teach any architecture fundamentals, his institution is still a legal one that Kaveh will not be able to challenge on legal grounds. But is there more to the story?

Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 uzayr 02.ogg Uzayr: I wanted to stay for a little longer. I'm still thinking about everything you taught during the class... Even though a lot of it went right over my head, I still thought the houses you drew were really pretty.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Of course they were! All the examples I drew were world-famous landmarks. Each one was the magnum opus of a celebrated architect.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: It's a good thing that you could recognize them for their beauty. The accumulation of knowledge is the first step to artistic expression. Instead of rote memorization, you should try to relate and to understand, and after that, try to resonate with the work.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 uzayr 03.ogg Uzayr: Resonate?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Yes. When I first got into architecture, there were many things about it that I couldn't understand at all. I would find a building to be beautiful, but have no idea what made it so good.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: And for most people, just being able to admire a building is enough. To become a good architect, however, you must also learn to assess and appraise.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Going from admiration to assessment will take a lot of time and specialized knowledge. And I'm afraid that some superficial speed training won't be enough to take you there.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 uzayr 04.ogg Uzayr: Just as I thought... Becoming an architect won't be as easy as Mr. Alkami made it out to be, right?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: ...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: I'm sorry. I'm not trying to crush your dreams — all I want to tell you is that an architect's life is not as carefree and easy as others may make it out to be.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 uzayr 05.ogg Uzayr: I understand. Thank you for telling me the truth, Mr. Kaveh. I think I'll still stay here for the time being, though, since my family still hasn't paid everything off.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: Hmm? Paid off what?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 uzayr 06.ogg Uzayr: ...Sorry, I can't say anything more. Mr. Alkami made it very clear that anyone who talks about it will be kicked out of the class...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: Don't listen to him. I am the most famous architect in Sumeru. If he kicks you out, then I'll just take you in instead.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 uzayr 07.ogg Uzayr: Really?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: Why would I pull your leg? I can see you have some talent, so as long as you get your fundamentals down, you should be able to pass the entrance exam, and continue your studies at the Akademiya.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 uzayr 08.ogg Uzayr: Th—Then, please keep this a secret for me, Mr. Kaveh. Truth be told, my family's not very well-off, so we couldn't really afford the tuition for this class.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 uzayr 09.ogg Uzayr: Mr. Alkami was the one who reached out to my parents. He told them that he knew a merchant by the name of Fakhr, and that we could get a loan from him.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 uzayr 10.ogg Uzayr: He told all the students that once we graduate, people would come flocking to commission us for projects. If everything went well, we'd be able to pay off everything in just a few years, and all the Mora we make after that would be ours.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: ...How much did your family borrow from this merchant?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 uzayr 11.ogg Uzayr: I think it was several million Mora...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: And what was the interest rate?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 uzayr 12.ogg Uzayr: I... I'm not really sure. My parents were the ones who signed the contract. All I know is that the stack of papers was as thick as a slab of rock...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: ...
 Something doesn't feel right about all of this.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: Yeah, I have a bad feeling, too. Something about the whole thing feels dastardly familiar.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: We need to find that merchant to confirm. But if we were to confront him right now, there's no way he'd admit to anything...
 We can pretend to be potential customers.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: Good idea. Hey, tell me, do you know where we'd be able to find this merchant?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 uzayr 13.ogg Uzayr: We last saw him on the north shore of Port Ormos. Who knows if he's still in that area, though...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: Well, it'd still be worth taking a look. Architecture... no, the arts shouldn't be used as bait for a scam.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907807 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: We need to do something before the students' lives are ruined even further.

(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Fakhr, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19078 fakhr 01.ogg Fakhr: (Let's see who we can reel in today...)
(Talk to Fakhr)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 fakhr 01.ogg Fakhr: Oh? I don't think I've ever seen you guys before. Here for business?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: You're Fakhr, right?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 fakhr 02.ogg Fakhr: Yes, may I ask who introduced you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Alkami. My friend here wants to enroll in his architecture class, but they're a bit short on money. Alkami told us that you're the man to go to in this kind of situation.
 That's right.
 I'm really interested in architecture.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 fakhr 03.ogg Fakhr: Oh, sounds like his business is booming. How much do you need?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: Let me see... I'd say around three million Mora.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 fakhr 04.ogg Fakhr: Oof... You call that "a bit short on money"? Anyway, since you're here because of Alkami, I can work things out for you. Make sure you sign the contract, though. Lots of people are borrowing money from me nowadays.
 What contract?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 fakhr 05.ogg Fakhr: Ah, here you go. Don't worry, there's nothing particularly unusual about it. All you need to do is to pay back the loan in full within three years.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: And what if they won't be able to pay it back?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 fakhr 06.ogg Fakhr: What do you mean, won't be able to pay it back? Once you graduate from Alkami's place, you'll be making millions of Mora a year, easy. At that point, paying this off will be a piece of cake.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 fakhr 07.ogg Fakhr: And even if you were to run into some difficulties and need to delay the installments, it's no big deal. We are all reasonable people here — if you can't pay quickly, you can just pay it back over a longer period. All that would change is your interest rates would get a little higher.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 fakhr 08.ogg Fakhr: It's hard work running a business. If we're taking risks to supply you with Mora, it's only fair that you take on a bit of the financial risk as well.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 fakhr 09.ogg Fakhr: Anyway, there's no point in tying yourself in knots over the contract. With the way you're reading every single line, it's like you're worried you're about to get scammed outta your whole life's savings. Why would I lie to you? Tons of students at Alkami's place have signed the contract. Aren't they all doing pretty well for themselves?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: ...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: I just did some calculations in my head. When you say the interest will get a little higher... do you mean it'll get higher than thirty percent?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Of course, the contract did a great job of trying to obfuscate that fact. It only listed the amount that you'll have to repay every day, which gives the false impression that the amount hasn't actually increased by all that much.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: If you actually do the math, however, it's clear that the amount you need to pay on interest alone will amount to hundreds of thousands of Mora per year. Most people can't even make that much Mora in a year... Your greed really knows no bounds.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: Even my creditor doesn't dare to raise rates that high. Once a family's signed on to a scheme like this, there's no getting out.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 fakhr 10.ogg Fakhr: What are you trying to say, huh?
 We mean to put you in jail for your crimes.
 The matra will happily answer that question.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 fakhr 11.ogg Fakhr: Hmph, I figured something was off when two well-dressed people came looking for a loan. Think you got the better of me?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 fakhr 12.ogg Fakhr: Too many people are sticking their noses where they don't belong these days. Luckily for me, though, this is a pretty secluded spot. Hey, come out and teach these guys a lesson!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: Ah, Eremites? Hmph, I've already fought off more than my fair share of them when I was working in the desert.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907809 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: There are only a few of them, so they shouldn't pose much of a threat. Mehrak, you're up!

Media:vo kvcop001 1907811 fakhr 01.ogg Fakhr: Hmph... Who are you, and what do you want?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907811 fakhr 02.ogg Fakhr: I don't think we've done anything to hurt or offend you, so why go this far to destroy my livelihood?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907811 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: ...Debt has the power to upend your whole life. I know very well just how miserable living in debt can be.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907811 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: But my debts are the culmination of many different factors, and my interest rate is still somewhat reasonable. As long as I continue to work with my situation in mind, my debts will eventually be paid off.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907811 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: But these students are different. They have neither the mental preparation nor the financial resources to pay back a debt like this.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907811 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: You sold the dreams of becoming an architect to the students as bait, urging them to take on insurmountable amounts of debt to satisfy your greed.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907811 fakhr 03.ogg Fakhr: Hah, everyone knows there's no such thing as a free lunch. It's their own fault for falling into the trap.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907811 fakhr 04.ogg Fakhr: And if we're going to talk about greed, aren't those students the ones who are blinded by it? They completely ignore the risk that's right there in front of them.
 That's no excuse for your actions.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907811 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: Hah, and here comes the silver tongue. Surely you used that to reel in the students as well. Even now, many of them are still hopelessly dreaming of striking gold after they graduate.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907811 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: ...People grow by learning from their mistakes. I hope this will be a valuable lesson to them.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907811 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Let's head back to the Akademiya and turn this guy over to the matra. They should be able to link him with Alkami's business.
You bring Fakhr to the Akademiya...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Cyno? Didn't think I would run into you here.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: My vacation just ended not too long ago, so I'm going over some cases at the Akademiya. Who's this?
You describe everything that's happened to Cyno...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: I see. Charging an interest rate over thirty percent indeed constitutes a crime.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: As it is highly likely that Alkami's also benefiting from this scheme, the matra will open an investigation on him as well. The training center will be closed until further notice.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: Any funds we manage to recover from the suspects will be returned to the students. It's unclear how much we'll be able to get back, however, given their extravagant spending.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: That should still be enough. Once the students realize the error of their ways, they won't fall so easily for such traps in the future.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: Anyway, thank you for your help. I hope this won't be too much trouble for you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: It's no trouble — just another day at work. How did you two get tangled up in this anyway?
 Alkami tried to hire Kaveh as one of his instructors.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: Did you accept any Mora from him?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: He promised to pay me three hundred thousand Mora per lecture, but I resigned as soon as I finished the first session. I didn't take a single coin.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: Ah, that's good.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: Hmm? What do you mean, "that's good"? Would you have taken me into custody as well if I had actually accepted any Mora?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: I wouldn't have gone that far, but had he insisted that you were also an active participant in his schemes, under our rules, we would have been required to open an investigation on you as well.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: Either way, though, I believe you are innocent in all of this. Had you actually been alright with making money through less than noble means, your life wouldn't be the mess it currently is.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Hey, what was that? What do you mean my life is a mess?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: Never mind, your life is fine.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: ...You're just messing with me now, aren't you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: Let's get back to business. If Alkami's case can be successfully resolved, you'll be eligible for a monetary reward from the Akademiya. Don't forget to pick it up after the fact.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: Huh, I didn't even know there was such a thing. I never would've guessed. Ahem, what I'm trying to say is that we didn't report Alkami because we thought we could make some Mora off of it.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: The reward will be given regardless of your personal motivations. It was implemented with the intent of encouraging people to supply tips to the matra.
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: Fine.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 cyno 13.ogg Cyno: Is there anything else?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: I want to go back to the training center one more time and talk to some of the kids.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 cyno 14.ogg Cyno: Sure, but you should wait until tomorrow. My subordinates will shut down the center today, and summon the students to gather information on the total amount of Mora they've lost in the scam.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: Alright, then I'll stay out of their way. I can talk to the kids tomorrow.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 cyno 15.ogg Cyno: I have a few other things to take care of, so I'll be off for now. If you want to follow up on this case, just come find me again, or ask one of the matra.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: Phew... That should finally be the end of that. Ugh, who would have thought it would turn out like this? All I wanted was to find a new gig and earn some Mora.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: To think Alkami would sink this low... it still makes me really upset.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: Still... I think I feel a little better now than when you found me back at the tavern.
 Oh? How so?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: It's a little ironic, but you could say it's because I've realized that there are many circumstances in the world that are even worse than my own. Now that I've seen such things firsthand, I suppose I've earned a new sense of appreciation for my life.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: How should I put it? ...I'm pretty stubborn when it comes to my profession, so I often argue with my clients.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: The arguments are usually extremely frustrating, and every once in a while, I'd wonder if I only became an architect because fate wanted me to pay for some sins I'd committed in a previous life.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: Alkami's suggestion would have allowed me to quit my life as an architect and earn money solely from my reputation. But now that I've experienced that for myself... I can confidently say that I'd never want to do it again.
 And that's why he thinks you're too rigid when it comes to making Mora.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: Every scholar has their own sense of pride and a line that they don't like to cross. Of course, when faced with the vicissitudes of life, some will surrender these things to seek a more comfortable life. I can understand that.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 20.ogg Kaveh: Just speaking for myself though, I don't think that's something I'd ever be able to do. The voice in my heart would just keep repeating one thing: the moment I turn away from my dreams would be the moment my career ends.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 21.ogg Kaveh: If I stop devoting everything to my creative activities, I'd be able to lead a more comfortable life, but at the same time, my sense of intuition and understanding for the arts would also begin to degrade.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 22.ogg Kaveh: At that point, any materialistic ease I may have gained in life would just become another form of torment. In comparison, my current life comes with its share of difficulties, but at least I'd never have to deal with that kind of existential reckoning.
 I can understand that.
 It's good to stay true to yourself.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 23.ogg Kaveh: Haha, I appreciate it. You may call me conceited for this, but I would also like to think I'm talented enough to be able to lead a decent life without compromising my pride.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 24.ogg Kaveh: It's certainly not easy, but... I want to keep at it.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 25.ogg Kaveh: My thanks again for being such a great help throughout all of this. I'm planning to pay another visit to those kids tomorrow — want to come with me?
 Sure, I'll come.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907813 kaveh 26.ogg Kaveh: Alright, I'll see you tomorrow then. Get some good rest.

Media:vo kvcop001 1907816 uzayr 01.ogg Uzayr: Mr. Kaveh said we can keep working on our fundamentals, and try to get into the Akademiya.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907816 tanisha 02.ogg Tanisha: Hah, easier said than done... if it was easier to get into the Akademiya, none of us would have signed up for this class in the first place.

Media:vo kvcop001 1907816 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Now, that's "Mr. Kaveh" to you. I am here as your instructor, so let's keep things a little more proper.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907816 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: I'll keep instructing you for a while longer. You can pass on the message to the other students. As long as someone wants to come, they can join the class.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907816 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Oh also, I'm usually pretty busy, so I'll only be able to teach architecture fundamentals on my days off. Another disclaimer, I can't promise that you'll all be able to understand everything I'm going to teach.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907816 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: Architecture is not an easy profession. Aesthetics aside, even the basics of safe design can already be a handful for most people.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907816 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: If you want to design safe buildings, you'll have to go through a systematic study of structural engineering.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907816 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: And just as a heads up, all of this will be a huge step up from the superficial stuff you were learning before. It'll take both talent and perseverance to get through the course. I don't want to hear anyone say that I didn't warn you.

 Where to?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907816 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: You'll know once we get there. Come on, let's get going. We'll be off once everyone's grabbed their pencils and sketch pads.
(Approach the shore opposite Pharos Lighthouse)
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907817 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: This lighthouse has been around for a long time, and I handled its renovations when I first graduated from the Akademiya.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907817 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: The point of today is not so much about the lighthouse as a building, however.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907817 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: I just want you to take a look at it and do a bit of self-reflection. If you were tasked today with designing a building, how would you want it to look like?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907817 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Don't think about how you'd actually go about building it for now. Just put your ideas to paper, and draw the prettiest building that comes to your mind.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907817 uzayr 01.ogg Uzayr: So it can be... any kind of building?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907817 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: Yep, as long as you think it'd look good. It doesn't even necessarily have to be a building. If you want, you can draw trees, the ocean, or even a garden area. Draw whatever you'd like.
 What's the point of this exercise?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907817 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: In my experience, it's best to approach the study of architecture from a point of personal interest, rather than for the sake of a career.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907817 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Both the study and practice of architectural design are extremely difficult. A person who's forced to work on projects that they don't resonate with will only struggle and suffer.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907817 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: So at least for today... I hope the students will be able to create something that they enjoy. There's no need to think about it too hard — they'll have plenty of time in the future to revisit the design and make changes.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907817 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: What do you think? Want to try your hand at it as well? Don't forget that this is a free class from Mr. Kaveh, the light of the Kshahrewar. On a normal day, this would cost you three hundred thousand Mora...

Your ideal building is also your safe haven.

Trivia[]
In this route, a minor contradiction to Kaveh's established information occurs, as Kaveh states that he has previously hosted free lectures but has never been recruited by a formal business. Sasani previously stated that Kaveh had taught an architectural elective at the Sumeru Akademiya before she enrolled, and Alhaitham mentions that he was paid with Akademiya stipends. Furthermore, the caption of Kaveh’s 2023 birthday art, which mentions him being a returning visiting professor at the Akademiya, confirms that he had previously lectured there.

For More Experience[]
 Quest DescriptionNoelle has great strength but is never able to use it in real fights. You arrange some training to help her gain more practical combat experience...

(Look for slimes in Mondstadt's outskirts)
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Here we are! Let's start with Geo Slimes...
(After defeating the Geo Slimes)
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Piece of cake! Noelle's got moves!
(If the Geo Slimes are not defeated in time)
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Maybe we should try a different opponent...

(At the next training area)
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? There are Dendro Slimes hiding here!
(After failing the challenge)
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hmm... that looked a bit tough for Noelle. Perhaps Dendro Slimes aren't her forte.
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Still, avoiding unfavorable battles is a big part of combat strategy!
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: I see... Noted!

Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: The next target is... an Eye of the Storm!?
(After failing to defeat the Eye of the Storm)
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: No... the Eye of the Storm is getting away!

(Talk to Noelle)

(If the Eye of the Storm escaped)
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Ugh... It was too far up in the air, I couldn't get to it...
(If the Eye of the Storm was defeated)
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: ...Exhausting... It was too far up in the air, I couldn't get to it...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: If only Amber or Miss Lisa were here...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: No! I can't think like that. As a Knight, I must rely on my own strength...
 If it were me just now, I would have gone to Amber or Lisa for help.
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Huh? But...
 It is precisely because the power of a single knight is limited that the Knights of Favonius was formed. Don't you think?
 Unity and teamwork allow each knight to better utilize their strengths.
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: That makes sense... If only I'd fought together with you just now...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: "The camaraderie and solidarity of its members form the backbone of the Knights of Favonius..."
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: So that's what Article 8 of the Knights of Favonius Handbook really means...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: I never... looked at it that way before...
 Noelle, why don't you choose the final training target?
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: Me? ...You think I can choose a suitable target?
 Choosing an appropriate enemy is also a part of your training...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: Really? Let me think...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: ...I should avoid enemies that I find difficult... and consider the power of teamwork... hmm...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: Hmmm... Ah! I've got it!
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: I heard from Master Jean that there was a hilichurl camp nearby, that often attacks traveling merchants.
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: Even though driving away hilichurls is usually something for the Knights...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: Maybe this time... I can do it!
 Let's do it together.
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 20.ogg Noelle: Great, you and me!

 Quest DescriptionWith your help, Noelle seems to have grasped some of the essentials of live combat and decides to try it out on a nearby hilichurl camp...
(Approach the nearby hilichurl camp)
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 01.ogg ???: Noeeeelle! Noeeeelle!
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Who's that? I—I need to help!
(Talk to Henning after defeating all the hilichurls in the camp.)
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 02.ogg Henning: Th—Thank the Anemo Archon! Finally, I'm saved...
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 03.ogg Henning: Ah... and thanks to Noelle and the Honorary Knight too...
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 04.ogg Henning: If it hadn't been for you two, I can't imagine what would have happened.
 Just glad you're okay.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 05.ogg Henning:  You guys are here to save me... right?
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: We were training nearby and happened to hear you calling my name. Luckily, we got here just in time.
 We were quite far away...
 Could you really recognize Noelle from that distance?
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 06.ogg Henning: Haha... I think I wanted to say "help," or "Barbatos protect me," or something to that effect...
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 07.ogg Henning: I didn't even realize that I'd called out Noelle's name instead.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 08.ogg Henning: I guess in Mondstadt we're just so used to calling Noelle's name when we're in trouble.
 Sound like you're a little too dependent on her.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Oh, it's fine! It's an honor to be able to help everyone.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Not to mention, I might not have registered Henning's cry if that weren't the case.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Still... good thing the hilichurls we encountered weren't too fierce. Thankfully, I was able to handle them.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 09.ogg Henning: Huh? Not too fierce? I was so scared I couldn't even move my legs.
 Those weren't weak hilichurls.
 You've gotten stronger.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: R—Really?
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: I just did what I usually do...
 The intention was different.
 This wasn't training... you were trying to protect someone.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Ah, I guess so...
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: I did have my mind set on not letting Henning get hurt...
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: So if my intention is different, it can have a big effect on the outcome...
 It's because protecting others is the source of your strength.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 10.ogg Henning: You know, I think you're right!
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 11.ogg Henning: Whenever Noelle is helping us out, she's usually more powerful than in training!
 This is no reason for you to rely on her though.
 In the future, don't leave everything to Noelle.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 12.ogg Henning: Ahaha... Absolutely. No more of that.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 13.ogg Henning: ...In any case, I'm extremely grateful to you both.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: N—No problem, merely fulfilling my duties as a maid of Favonius!
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Maid Noelle of the Knight of Favonius, at your service!

Special Cocktailing Condiments[]

(Talk to Diona)
Media:vo dancop001 1910601 blanche 01.ogg Blanche: Welcome, is there anything you need?
Media:vo dancop001 1910601 diona 01.ogg Diona: Hello Blanche, I came to pick up my order!
Media:vo dancop001 1910601 blanche 02.ogg Blanche: Diona! Let me see...
Media:vo dancop001 1910601 blanche 03.ogg Blanche: Yes... fifteen Lizard Tails, seven vials of Butterfly Dust... Hmm, everything other than the bottle of Frog Mucus is ready.
Media:vo dancop001 1910601 diona 02.ogg Diona: No rush on that, I'll take whatever's ready. Someone from the tavern will come to settle the bill later.
Media:vo dancop001 1910601 blanche 04.ogg Blanche: Alright, thank you for your business~
 What are these...?
Media:vo dancop001 1910601 diona 03.ogg Diona: Have you forgotten already? I told you, these are ingredients for flavoring drinks.
Media:vo dancop001 1910601 diona 04.ogg Diona: This is a list of ingredients that I put together after consulting many people. The ones we picked up today were primarily from an alchemist named Timaeus, he's recommended many ingredients to me.
 These look more like alchemy ingredients...
Media:vo dancop001 1910601 diona 05.ogg Diona: Well... hehe, yeah, I did ask Timaeus before about what ingredients they use to improve the taste of alchemic medicine...
Media:vo dancop001 1910601 diona 06.ogg Diona: He mentioned things like Lizard Tails and Crystal Cores. But I think Crystal Cores overlap too much with the texture of ice cubes, so I chose not to use them.
Media:vo dancop001 1910601 diona 07.ogg Diona: I have, however, always wanted to try Frog Mucus. According to Timaeus, it can make the texture of a drink as thick as mud! Haha! Meow...
Media:vo dancop001 1910601 diona 08.ogg Diona: Now all we have left to get is some Fish Scales and Slime Condensate...
Media:vo dancop001 1910601 diona 09.ogg Diona: Let's search for those in the wild. Once we have everything, I can make you that drink.
(Talk to Diona in Springvale)
Media:vo dancop001 1910602 diona 01.ogg Diona: Ahh, we made it! Whether it's the meat, skin, or tails, the fish here have great texture and quality. Mmm...
Media:vo dancop001 1910602 diona 02.ogg Diona: They also have a strong but interesting grass-like scent to the meat and scales here, too.
Media:vo dancop001 1910602 diona 03.ogg Diona: Most people can't handle it, but to the foodies that have unique tastes, it's amazing.
 You sure know a lot about fish.
Media:vo dancop001 1910602 diona 04.ogg Diona: What? No! No, I just overheard stuff from a bunch of old drunks while I was making drinks. Ugh, please. It's not like I went out of my way to learn about fish or anything!
Media:vo dancop001 1910602 diona 05.ogg Diona: Anyways, just go down there and catch us a few fresh fish. I have way too many ingredients here and it'd be a hassle for me.
(Obtain Fresh Fish ×3)
(Talk to Diona after harvesting fish)
Media:vo dancop001 1910604 diona 01.ogg Diona: Did you catch any fresh fish?
(After submitting Fresh Fish)
Media:vo dancop001 1910603 diona 01.ogg Diona: Wow, you swim really well, and you're almost as good at catching fish as the cats I look after.
Media:vo dancop001 1910603 diona 02.ogg Diona: First we need to scrape off the scales oh, and make sure you also collect the mucus on the fish...
Media:vo dancop001 1910603 diona 03.ogg Diona: Ooh! Whoa, the smell of fish... along with that unique grassy smell... it's... so strong! But that's okay, it's the potent aroma we need!
 Uh, I'm going to go stand as far as possible from this stuff.
 I really need to wash my hands.
Media:vo dancop001 1910603 diona 04.ogg Diona: Heh, it's too much for you, huh? Hmm, I guess I can understand. You're not a professional bartender, after all, your tolerance for special ingredients is not like mine.
Media:vo dancop001 1910603 diona 05.ogg Diona: Alright, that'll just about do it. Soaking the scales in the mucus collected from the fish will help preserve them for now.
Media:vo dancop001 1910603 diona 06.ogg Diona: Next, we need to get some Slime Condensate. I know a place with a ton of slimes, let's go.
(Obtain Fresh Fish Scales ×3)

A Chance Encounter...?[]

(Talk to Diona by the Dawn Winery)
Media:vo dancop001 1910604 diona 02.ogg Diona: Look, the slimes we're looking for are just ahead.
Media:vo dancop001 1910604 diona 03.ogg Diona: Huh, if I go after those slimes, I might ruin all the ingredients I have with me. And that would be bad...
Media:vo dancop001 1910604 diona 04.ogg Diona: Can you defeat those slimes and bring me the Slime Condensate?
(Obtain Fresh Slime Condensate ×3)
(Talk to Diona after defeating the slimes)
Media:vo dancop001 1910607 diona 01.ogg Diona: Did you get the Slime Condensate?
(After submitting Fresh Slime Condensate)
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 01.ogg Diona: Great job! Quick and precise. Only people who don't drink can fight like that!
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 02.ogg Diona: Hm! I think Slime Condensate will intensify the taste and texture of the drink, hehehe...
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 03.ogg Diona: Hmm... You might be a little unfamiliar, but aside from the taste of the alcohol, those old drunkards are also very keen on the texture of the drink. They've even invented a number of phrases to describe it.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 04.ogg Diona: For example, "sticky like honey," or "refreshing as the springs." Blergh...
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 05.ogg Diona: They use beautified ways of describing their drinks. But, drinking is drinking. It doesn't matter how you make it sound, alcohol is still a terrible thing.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 06.ogg Diona: Huh. The reason why I wanna use Slime Condensate is because I want a dense, sticky consistency.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 07.ogg Diona: Once I put this into a drink, I'm sure it'll preserve its form and start absorbing the alcohol quickly...
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 08.ogg Diona: Those old boozers wanted to try something different, huh? Hehe. Well, they can try this sticky, gooey Drunken Slime!
 Why do you want to use this to make drinks?
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 09.ogg Diona: So I can make the worst drink conceivable and show everyone the true nature of alcohol.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 10.ogg Diona: In order to attract customers, taverns use all kinds of strategies and schemes to make people believe that alcohol is not only good, but a necessity!
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 11.ogg Diona: They use special ingredients, come up with fancy names, and promote limited-time drinks for holidays and events. They come up with all kinds of reasons to get people drinking.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 12.ogg Diona: And Dawn Winery is the heart of it all. They have no boundaries when it comes to selling alcohol.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 13.ogg Diona: Their one and only goal is to make sure that people keep drinking, and that their own pockets get filled with Mora.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 14.ogg Diona: Not only is it a crime, but it's also a scam! No good can come from alcohol!
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 15.ogg Diona: My mission is to make the worst drink ever, and to wake people up and free Mondstadt from the jaws of alcoholism.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 16.ogg Diona: That is why I'm always searching for new ingredients and experimenting with them.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 17.ogg Diona: Ugh, however... up until now, I haven't been able to make a single bad drink, no matter what ingredients I use! All the drinks I mix only make those deadbeat drunks all the happier! Ugh!
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 18.ogg Diona: I've already lost track of how many kinds of ingredients I've tried. I've even used ingredients way more unusual than this and have yet to ever succeed.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 19.ogg Diona: I really don't know what I need to do to make the most horrendous drink in the world! Meow...
 How about trying a different way of making drinks?
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 20.ogg Diona: A different way?
 How do you usually make your drinks?
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 21.ogg Diona: I've always stuck to my own way of making drinks, although I've watched other bartenders before and learned a bit from them as well.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 22.ogg Diona: What are you trying to say? That my methods aren't professional enough?
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 23.ogg Diona: Hmph! Believe you me, I've done my research! I've studied how to handle a shaker, adjust the temperature of the glasses, and even the subtle techniques of stirring...
 Why don't we start by looking at your mixing technique?
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 24.ogg Diona: My mixing technique? You're saying the reason I can't make terrible drinks is because of my technique?
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 25.ogg Diona: Hmm... It's true that I've never been professionally trained. But I hear from the old drunkards that it's really complicated, that every step must be precise, that even the slightest mistake is unacceptable...
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 26.ogg Diona: Or else...
 Or else the drink will taste bad?
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 27.ogg Diona: That... That was right! Or else the drink will taste bad!
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 28.ogg Diona: I—I see, I've never thought of it this way before...
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 29.ogg Diona: First, we need to find someone to ask about the techniques of mixing a great drink. Then we use the same ingredients...
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 30.ogg Diona: And purposely mess up every step of the process!
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 31.ogg Diona: Haha, yeah! This might finally work, woohoo! Wait a second, how did you come up with this idea? You don't secretly drink a lot, do you? Grr...
 I don't think anyone in this world would ever sell me alcohol...
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 32.ogg Diona: That's a good thing. It'd be best to never have a single drop.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 33.ogg Diona: Alright then, first I need to find a professional bartender. One that I could consult about the ways of mixing a drink professionally.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 34.ogg Diona: Now where could I find someone? Ugh, does this mean I need to go to Angel's Share? ...Or Dawn Winery?
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 35.ogg Diona: Nope, nope, uh-uh, never! I refuse to ever set paw in those places... Don't even ask. I have my own reasons.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 36.ogg Diona: Let's head back first, we've collected plenty of ingredients. As for the mixing techniques... I'll figure out another way.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 connor 01.ogg Connor: Diona? And this is... Oh, it's the Honorary Knight.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 connor 02.ogg Connor: Oh, what a coincidence running into you two here. Are you out collecting ingredients? So what are you planning to whip up this time? It's always a surprise to see what you make.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 connor 03.ogg Connor: I myself know a thing or two about mixing drinks, but Elzer tells me that my drinks can't even compare to Diona's... They seem to lack that "special something."
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 connor 04.ogg Connor: I've been looking for some inspiration, but I've been stuck in a rut. I'm not sure whether it's the traditional techniques I use, or if I'm just too conservative with my ingredients.
 This is your opportunity to ask about mixing techniques!
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 37.ogg Diona: You mean I should ask him for some professional pointers?
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 38.ogg Diona: Hmm... alright. Perhaps he'll do.
 We'd like to ask you about your techniques for mixing drinks.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 39.ogg Diona: Yeah, umm... You're trying to find new mixing inspiration... and I'm trying some new recipes out. Maybe we can... exchange some ideas, hmm?
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 connor 05.ogg Connor: Oh! Why, I'd be honored! No problem at all!
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 40.ogg Diona: However, for the ingredients, we must use the ones I've just collected. I have Lizard Tails, Butterfly Dust, Fish Scales, and Slime Condensate.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 connor 06.ogg Connor: Hmm... we need to use these materials, huh? Well I guess it's time for me to expand my repertoire as well...
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 connor 07.ogg Connor: Let's go back to the winery. I have some basic mixing tools there.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 41.ogg Diona: Y—You mean we have to go to Dawn Winery? Couldn't we also go to Angel's Share? I mean, they have a full range of mixing tools...
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 connor 08.ogg Connor: Hmm... Well, you are the bartender at the Cat's Tail, right?
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 connor 09.ogg Connor: Given that the Cat's Tail and Angel's Share are competitors, it would be rather inappropriate if you were to mix drinks there. That would probably cause quite a bit of trouble for Margaret as well.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 connor 10.ogg Connor: Besides, there are many loyal patrons at Angel's Share. With your reputation, it'd cause quite a commotion if you were to be seen mixing drinks there.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 connor 11.ogg Connor: In any case, I wouldn't recommend going to Angel's Share. Besides, the winery's close by, there's no need for us to go so far.
 (Is it me, or was that a rehearsed speech?)
 (It feels like he's been practicing this speech...)
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 42.ogg Diona: Speaking of the winery, won't that guy Elzer be there?
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 connor 12.ogg Connor: Elzer? Sure, he'll be there, but he's been busy lately taking care of guild matters. Why do you ask?
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 43.ogg Diona: Hmph, just as long as he's not around. Our little exchange here is between just the two of us, it'd be best if others don't get involved.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 44a.ogg Media:vo dancop001 1910605 diona 44b.ogg Diona: Well, except for the Traveler here, we've been out collecting ingredients together. (‍HeHeText for male Traveler/SheSheText for female Traveler‍)'s kinda like... my assistant. (‍HeHeText for male Traveler/SheSheText for female Traveler‍)'ll be allowed to participate.
Media:vo dancop001 1910605 connor 13.ogg Connor: Haha um... Haha, fine by me. Shall we get going? The winery isn't far, we'll be there in no time.

Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 01.ogg Ogawa: Sayu, is it true? Have you completed the mission?
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 02.ogg Ogawa: I don't recall you ever taking any ambush missions before. How were you able to deal with the renowned Traveler so swiftly?
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 01a.ogg Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 01b.ogg Sayu: Uh, well... You see, I... I caught (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) off guard! Yeah, that's it, (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍) didn't have time to react.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: All it took was one THUMP! Then BAM! And it was over...
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 03.ogg Ogawa: Oh no, how could this be. I really didn't see this coming...
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 04.ogg Ogawa: Don't you usually just ignore your orders from the Shuumatsuban? How was I supposed to know that you'd actually take this one and finish it so efficiently?
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Uh, well, I don't feel sleepy every day, you know.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: So don't underestimate me. My sensei did teach me some ambush techniques, I just never used them before, that's all.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 05.ogg Ogawa: I see... Fine, I'll report back then.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: Hey, wait! Don't leave! (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), you can come out now!
 Stop right there.
 Don't even think about running off.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 06.ogg Ogawa: Huh!? Explain yourself, Sayu. What's going on here? So... you were lying to me the whole time? The Traveler is still alive?
 Alive and in the flesh.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: The shrine maiden already confirmed that there was no such mission.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: So we decided to catch you red-handed in your own game, you sneaky sneak.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 07.ogg Ogawa: W—Wait, I can explain! It's not what you think!
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 08.ogg Ogawa: Yes, I was the one who forged the ambush mission, but I had good reason to!
 Tell us the truth, no more lies!
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 Save it for the Yashiro Commission. I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
(Proceed to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 Tell us the truth, no more lies!
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 10.ogg Ogawa: Just hear me out! You see, last night, my little daughter suddenly disappeared from home. I was starting to get worried when a Kairagi appeared at my door and told me they'd taken her.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 11.ogg Ogawa: They told me I'd only see my kid again if I did exactly as they said. Their terms were for me to forge orders from the Yashiro Commission and dispatch a ninja to ambush the Traveler.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 10a.ogg Sayu: Huh? That doesn't make sense... Why would the Kairagi want to ambush the Traveler? And why the Shuumatsuban?
 I fight the Kairagi on a daily basis, it only makes sense that they would seek revenge.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: Oh, no wonder...
 Maybe they know that they're not strong enough to take me out, so they wanted to hire an expert to do the job.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 12.ogg Ogawa: That seems about right. I was puzzled myself, but they didn't tell me anything... and I didn't dare to ask.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 13.ogg Ogawa: I was scared out of my wits. I simply did whatever they told me to.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 14.ogg Ogawa: Then it dawned on me that Sayu was the only ninja that never carried out such confrontational tasks, and that Kano Nana is her guardian.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 15.ogg Ogawa: So I thought that if I assigned the task to Sayu, it wouldn't be a threat to you at all. Half the time she never even completes her tasks.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 16.ogg Ogawa: To my surprise, just as I was about to secretly contact the Tenryou Commission and save my kid, I found Sayu's bag in the mission crate indicating that the job was taken care of... It scared me half to death.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: No wonder you looked so unhappy when I met with you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 17a.ogg Ogawa: Of course, given the Traveler's position in the Yashiro Commission, who would dare make any move against them... After hearing Sayu carried out the task, I really felt things were spinning out of control.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 18.ogg Ogawa: To be honest, I was relieved to see that you were all right.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: He seems to be telling the truth.
 He did seem a bit relieved when I appeared. Now it makes sense.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: Are the Kairagi still holding your child hostage?
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 19.ogg Ogawa: Yes, that's right. Myself and the Tenryou Commission are both at a loss as to what to do now...
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 20.ogg Ogawa: If the Kairagi catch on to us, they might harm my child... *sigh* No, we mustn't let that happen, no matter what.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: Seems we need to come up with a plan of our own.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 21.ogg Ogawa: What do you suggest?
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Think about it this way... If I did successfully ambush the Traveler, you would still have to report it to the Kairagi.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 22.ogg Ogawa: Ah, I see. I'll use the evidence to rescue my daughter!
 But there's a chance the Kairagi won't go along with it.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: No worries, we'll be hiding nearby, so we can act if we need to.
 Sounds like a plan.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: Now I can put my ninjutsu to good use, heh!
 Seems you've considered all the possible angles.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 19.ogg Sayu: It's a serious situation, we should all be vigilant.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 23.ogg Ogawa: Then it's decided. I'll contact the Kairagi as well as the Tenryou Commission.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 24.ogg Ogawa: My child's safety is in your hands. Please, don't let anything happen to her.

The Truth Behind the Order[]

(Approach the location)
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: It seems the Kairagi has arrived. Oh, and that must be Mr. Ogawa's daughter.
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Even after they hear the news that the ambush has been completed, there's no telling whether they'd make good on their promise to Mr. Ogawa.
 I have my doubts.
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: They really have no honor, do they?
 I'm sure they'll still want more.
 Greed has no end.
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: I see...
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: Alright, I'll stay wide awake and fully alert.
 Yes, me too.
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 ogawa 01a.ogg Media:vo zycop001 1901602 ogawa 01b.ogg Ogawa: Alright, you asked me to dispatch a ninja to get rid of the Traveler. Well, the deed is done. Here's some proof: (‍hishisText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) hair and clothing.
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 01.ogg Inou: Oh, is that so? Show me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 02.ogg Inou: Hmph, seems legit. How could I forget this gaudy hair color.
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 03.ogg Inou: Imagine, a Traveler from another land just coming here and attacking my people. That rascal should have known better.
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 04a.ogg Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 04b.ogg Inou: Heh, too bad (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍) never had the chance to learn from (‍hishisText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) mistakes. Haha!
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 ogawa 02.ogg Ogawa: Well then, I've held up my end of the deal. Now you must hold up yours, where's my child?
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 05.ogg Inou: Oh? You really don't get it, do you?
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 ogawa 03.ogg Ogawa: What!?
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 06.ogg Inou: I only said that it was over for her unless you do as I say. I never said anything about returning the little brat to you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 kotomi 01.ogg Kotomi: Daddy...
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 07.ogg Inou: I think we've held up our terms, I even brought her here to prove it to you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 08.ogg Inou: This way, I'm sure you'll be willing as ever to continue working with us.
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 ogawa 04.ogg Ogawa: Huh? That's not what you said!
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 09.ogg Inou: You dare speak in such a tone with me!?
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 10.ogg Inou: Don't let me lose my temper. Who's to say that I won't just do away with the both of you... I can do anything when I'm angry.
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 11.ogg Inou: Or... perhaps you feel bolder now because you've already ratted on me to the Shogunate? Hmm!?
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 ogawa 05.ogg Ogawa: Huh? No, no, I wouldn't dare, I...
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 ogawa 06.ogg Ogawa: But my child... Tell me, what must I do to get my child back!
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 12.ogg Inou: Let me think about it... And while I'm thinking, you can use these invincible ninja of yours to take out a couple pesky members of the Tenryou Commission.
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 ogawa 07.ogg Ogawa: Huh, how could I do that! How could anyone from the Shuumatsuban move against the Tenryou Commission!?
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 13.ogg Inou: That's not my problem to figure out. It's yours!
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 14.ogg Inou: Enough talking. Now, get out of here.
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 ogawa 08.ogg Ogawa: Argh!
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Hey! You really think we'd just let you off the hook like that?
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 15.ogg Inou: Huh!? Who are you? Ninja?
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 16.ogg Inou: And you! Aren't you supposed to be...
 Getting rid of me isn't that easy.
 I'm the outlander, Traveler of countless worlds!
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 17.ogg Inou: Ugh! Brothers, get them!
Media:vo zycop001 1901602 inou 18.ogg Inou: Ugh, Ogawa! This isn't over, you'll pay for this. You haven't seen the last of me!

(After the battle)
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 inou 01.ogg Inou: Hehe, not another step closer, Traveler. I'm warning you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 inou 02.ogg Inou: You certainly live up to your reputation, there's no doubt about that... But remember, the little girl is still in my hands.
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 inou 03.ogg Inou: Best not to do anything too hasty, we wouldn't want anything to happen to her, would we now?
(The camera pans to "Kotomi" who turns out to be the Sayu trick)
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 inou 04.ogg Inou: Hehe, don't test me now, I'll... Wait, huh...!?
 It's not afraid of your blade.
 Go ahead, do it.
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 inou 05.ogg Inou: H—How did this happen? When did you...
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: You've heard how skilled the ninja of the Shuumatsuban are, haven't you? Heh, too easy!
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: So easy that... *yawn* I'm starting to feel a little bit sleepy.
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 inou 06.ogg Inou: Huh? You little brat, you dare mock me? I'll pulverize you!
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 aoki 01.ogg Aoki: Stop right there!
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 aoki 02.ogg Aoki: This is the suspect behind the incident you reported?
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 ogawa 01.ogg Ogawa: Yes, that's right! Kotomi is already safe. Quick, you must apprehend him immediately!
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 inou 07.ogg Inou: Argh!
The Kairagi tries to flee but is captured and taken away by the Tenryou Commission.
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 kotomi 01.ogg Kotomi: Daddy!
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 kotomi 02.ogg Kotomi: *sobs* I knew that you would come to rescue me!
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 ogawa 02.ogg Ogawa: Don't cry, my dear. Daddy's here. Everything's all right now.
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 ogawa 03a.ogg Ogawa: Come now, you should thank these two. Without them, we would have never been able to rescue you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 kotomi 03a.ogg Media:vo zycop001 1901604 kotomi 03b.ogg Kotomi: Thank you, (‍Mr.Mr.Text for male Traveler/Ms.Ms.Text for female Traveler‍) Traveler! You and Ms. Ninja saved me!
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Ms. Ninja...
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: Hehe, don't mention it. It's nothing for a ninja.
 I'm just glad you're okay.
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 ogawa 04.ogg Ogawa: Such agility, and the way you handled that blade... I must say that I am quite impressed.
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 ogawa 05.ogg Ogawa: As for Sayu, I had thought that you'd given up on your ninja training. But somehow you seem to be stronger than ever.
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 ogawa 06.ogg Ogawa: If you don't mind, I'll be taking my child home now. Her mother has been worried sick.
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 ogawa 07.ogg Ogawa: Thank you, all of you. I could never repay you.
 You're most welcome.
 I'm glad we could help.
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 ogawa 08.ogg Ogawa: Please take care, the road is still dangerous.
Media:vo zycop001 1901604 kotomi 04a.ogg Media:vo zycop001 1901604 kotomi 04b.ogg Kotomi: Thank you (‍Mr.Mr.Text for male Traveler/Ms.Ms.Text for female Traveler‍) Traveler and Ms. Ninja!
(Ogawa and Kotomi leave)
Media:vo zycop001 1901606 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Hey, please wait a second. There's something I've been meaning to tell you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901606 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: This isn't the first time the Kairagi have done something like this. With a little further investigation, I think we could track down the bigger fish.
 You seem to have changed, Sayu. So hard working now...
 But don't you feel sleepy?
Media:vo zycop001 1901606 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Well, to be honest, I couldn't care less at first. All that ambushing stuff was just getting in the way of my nap schedule...
Media:vo zycop001 1901606 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: But after witnessing the crying kid and that big, nasty bad guy, I couldn't just ignore the situation like usual.
Media:vo zycop001 1901606 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: At that moment, the situation felt a lot more personal... Like it was my own problem, too.
Media:vo zycop001 1901606 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: In the end, the little girl thanked us, and even called me Ms. Ninja... No one has ever called me that before.
 Who knows, Sayu... Maybe you're a really hard worker after all.
Media:vo zycop001 1901606 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: Hmm, don't count on it... This time just was an exception. Sleeping is still what I do best.
Media:vo zycop001 1901606 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: In fact, once this is all over with, I'm going to find a nice, comfy spot where nobody can find me and take a long nap.
Media:vo zycop001 1901606 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: Yes... A really long... Comfy... *yawn*
Media:vo zycop001 1901606 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Whew, I'm getting sleepy...
 Let's all take a rest then, shall we?
Media:vo zycop001 1901606 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: No need, let's head back first. If I fall asleep now, I'm worried that I might forget some of the things that happened today...
Media:vo zycop001 1901606 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: So don't worry about me... I'll be just... fine... *dozing off*

The Best Rest


Aether
Lumine







The sleep after one's labor is always the sweetest. She's worked hard — you suppose you can watch over her for a while longer.

Branch 2[]

 Save it for the Yashiro Commission. I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 ogawa 09.ogg Ogawa: N—No, please, just hear me out! I'll explain everything!
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: I've got him tied up, he's not going anywhere.
Media:vo zycop001 1901601 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: That takes care of that. Now all we need to do is drag you back and I can have a good night's sleep.

Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Hm? Oh, hello Traveler. And I see Sayu and Mr. Ogawa are with you. Is something the matter?
After figuring the whole story out, Ayaka immediately arranges for the Yashiro Commission to open up an investigation.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I understand the situation... It seems Mr. Ogawa was only acting out of coercion from the Kairagi, he had no intent to truly harm you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 03.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: However, it concerns me that those forged orders went as far as they did, it's my responsibility to look into such matters. I will take the appropriate measures to resolve this.
 No problem.
 As long as we can resolve the situation.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 04.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Allow me to take the investigation matters from here. You needn't worry any longer.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: *yawn* If that's all, then we should get going.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: I can't help but feel a little uneasy here...
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 05.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: It's not often that I get to see you here, Sayu.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Uh... Heh.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 06.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: It seems that Sayu is almost always sleepy and in need of a good nap. To see her here accompanying you and addressing these matters goes to show how much effort she is expending on your behalf.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 07.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: But from now on, you should better attend to your duties. There's no need to keep Kano Nana worrying all the time.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: But I don't want to work...
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: All I want is some sleep, but you keep the shrine maiden on my tail all the time.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: There's loads of way more qualified ninja to handle every task. The Shuumatsuban would be the same with or without me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 08a.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: But you performed admirably the first time you assisted the Traveler, did you not?
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 09.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Everyone believes that there are some missions that only you can accomplish.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 10.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: This truth remains, whether you choose to believe it or not. Your sensei taught you ninjutsu so that you may step in when a mission needs you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: Yes, I understand, but...
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: Sorry, I don't know what to say.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: I should go... bye.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 11.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: *sigh* ...
 Perhaps you were a little too hard on her?
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 12.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: She's just a little... lost. It is only my wish to help her.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 13.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Before her sensei suddenly decided to leave, they insisted that I watch over her progress. Part of the reason I've assigned Kano Nana to keep an eye on her is to fulfill my promise.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 14.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: In fact, I'm certain that Sayu remembers her sensei's aspirations for her quite clearly. Otherwise, she would have quit the Shuumatsuban long ago.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 15.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: She's been lost and unsure of herself ever since her beloved sensei's abrupt departure.
 I understand. I'll go see if I can talk to her.
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 16.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you, Traveler. She obviously has some reservations towards me. Though I've only desired to help and look after her, I'm afraid it's never culminated to much.
 This is what we call "growing pains."
Media:vo zycop001 1901605 ayaka 17.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, perhaps you're right.
(Talk to Ayaka again)
Media:vo zycop001 1901607 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Please, go and talk to her. See if you can offer her any console.
Media:vo zycop001 1901607 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I understand the trouble she is facing. Fortunately, she is young and has many years ahead of her. There's no need to be hasty.

(Talk to Sayu)
Media:vo zycop001 1901607 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Sensei told me that all I need to do is grow big and tall. I remember that...
Media:vo zycop001 1901607 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: I had no idea how difficult such a simple thing could turn out to be.
Media:vo zycop001 1901607 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: I'm not complaining, you know. I understand everyone has hopes for me... Miss Kamisato, Sensei, the shrine maiden...
Media:vo zycop001 1901607 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: But I haven't done anything right. And whenever I try to do my best, I can't help but feel more pressure bearing down on me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901607 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: If only I grew a little taller, maybe then I could handle it.
 Don't worry Sayu. Like Ayaka said, no one wants to pressure you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901607 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: *sigh* I guess all I can do is say sorry...
 If you don't try now, there's no guarantee that you can do well in the future.
Media:vo zycop001 1901607 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: I get it. That's why I admire those who still try... even if they don't want to.
 Maybe you won't grow right away, but I can lift you higher whenever needed.
Media:vo zycop001 1901607 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: But, what would I do if I keep you from growing? No, I would feel too guilty...
Media:vo zycop001 1901607 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: Anyway, thank you. I don't know what else to say. Even talking is starting to feel difficult now.
Media:vo zycop001 1901607 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: This is why I don't like coming here...

Give It Up![]

(Go to Chinju Forest)
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: We've arrived. Alright, I will go to the Yashiro Commission now to inquire about Sayu's mission orders. In the meantime, please keep an eye on her.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 02a.ogg Kano Nana: Sayu, you can start by warming up. Though you may often be difficult for me, I certainly will not abide any trouble for the Traveler. Understand?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Yes, ma'am.
Kano Nana leaves.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Good, she's gone. Phew, no more work for today, hehe!
 So that's why you wanted me to come along? To help you slack off?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Actually... I invited you to come as a helper. No need to go into too much detail.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: The shrine maiden is terrifying. As soon as she picks up on my tracks, it's nearly impossible for me to shake her.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: But you are also super skilled, so maybe you can help me.
 I don't think I should be doing this kind of thing.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Huh? You mean you won't rescue someone in a moment of dire need?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: All that goes on here is cruel and involuntary labor.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: Is it wrong to wish for ample rest? How else can I ever reach my growth spurt!? I'm not being unreasonable.
 I've been meaning to ask you... Why are you so obsessed with sleeping all the time?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: Don't you know, there are tons of benefits to sleeping! You can regain energy, clear your mind, pass the time, and escape from all your troubles.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: But most importantly, sleep helps you grow, and I've got plenty of growing to do.
 Growing?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: That's right. The other ninja can leap up tall trees in a single bound and pick the tasty fruit way up high. Being tall is the key to everything.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: All the other ninja my age are already way taller than me. Sensei told me that kids only have one chance to grow up, and that I'll miss my chance if I keep slacking off.
 But is growing taller really related to how long you sleep?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: Of course it is! Haven't you seen someone suddenly grow taller while they're sleeping?
 I've never seen anyone grow in their sleep.
 I don't think anyone could "suddenly" grow taller.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: It happens all the time! Though, I guess it does sound silly when you think about it...
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: Ugh, never mind. The longer I talk to you, the more you'll convince me otherwise...
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Besides, what's wrong with wanting a little more sleep? *yawn* See... I'm already crazy tired.
 Growing taller is what you really care about, isn't it?
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 I can see that you're tired, but it's not good to neglect your work either.
(Proceed to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 Growing taller is what you really care about, isn't it?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Exactly. At first, I only wanted to grow as fast as possible. But as I started sleeping more every day, the sleepier I became. The sleepier I became, the more I slept.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: Even right now, I'm awake and talking with you, but my brain still feels half asleep... Trust me, work is the last thing on my mind.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 19.ogg Sayu: Maybe you can help me! Even though I've been getting more sleep recently, I haven't gained any height at all. Any ideas?
 Sleep alone isn't enough to make you grow taller.
(Proceed to Branch 1.A)
 It's not the amount of sleep but the quality of sleep that's keeping you from growing.
(Proceed to Branch 1.B)

Branch 1.A[]

 Sleep alone isn't enough to make you grow taller.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 31.ogg Sayu: Huh? You're saying there's a way to grow taller while I'm awake, too?
 Plants grow best when the environmental conditions are right for them to generate energy and get proper nutrition. The same is probably true for people.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 32.ogg Sayu: Yes... You do have a point. Hmm.
 How is your appetite these days?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 33.ogg Sayu: It's nothing compared to the adults. Just a little food is enough to make me full. I usually prefer eating fruit rather than those big, filling dishes.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 34.ogg Sayu: But I think I get it now... With more nutrients, people can grow bigger and taller. If anybody can eat a lot, it's the samurai. I should follow their example.
 You don't need to grow as big as a samurai though...
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 35.ogg Sayu: Hehe, I guess. Let's head into town and find something to eat.
 But Kano Nana hasn't returned yet.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 36.ogg Sayu: We won't be able to go anywhere once she's around. Now's our only chance!
(Proceed to Bottleneck Breaking)

Branch 1.B[]

 It's not the amount of sleep but the quality of sleep that's keeping you from growing.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 37.ogg Sayu: Quality sleep is hard to come by, especially with the shrine maiden always after me... Not much I can do about that.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 38.ogg Sayu: Somehow, she knows all my favorite napping spots. Sometimes I wonder if she knows everything. *sigh* It's tough to throw her off my trail.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 39.ogg Sayu: Anyway, let's go have a look around. *yawn* Maybe we can find a nice place to curl up for a nap.
(Proceed to Sleep Alone Can't Wait)

Branch 2[]

 I can see that you're tired, but it's not good to neglect your work either.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 20.ogg Sayu: Yeah, I suppose I haven't kept up with my duties... I'm sorry, but...
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 21.ogg Sayu: *yawn* I really am getting sleepy...
 It seems you aren't taking the matter to heart at all.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 22.ogg Sayu: It's because my work is just too boring. Transporting documents, organizing the ninja tools... As long as I don't do the work, no one will come asking me to do it again.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 23.ogg Sayu: The higher ups always give all the important tasks to more suitable operatives. They never even give me a second thought.
 It's still your responsibility to fulfil your duties.
 You should try to at least keep your sensei and Kano Nana from worrying.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 24.ogg Sayu: Hmm. Now that you say that, I just had an idea.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 25.ogg Sayu: If you learn ninjutsu and help me with my tasks, then I can sleep peacefully and focus more on growing.
 You still haven't taken anything I've said to heart.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 26.ogg Sayu: Ninjutsu will come in super handy during your adventures. Don't worry, I'll personally teach you everything.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 27.ogg Sayu: If you work hard, then I'll work hard to teach you. See? This way, nobody is wasting time being lazy, hehe!
 Now you're the one trying to convince me to work.
 Fine, if that's what we have to do.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 28.ogg Sayu: Thank you so much! See, you're the hero that protects Sayu's nap time!
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 29.ogg Sayu: We can start training as soon as the shrine maiden gets back.
After a while, Kano Nana returns.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 03.ogg Kano Nana: Oh, I'm honestly surprised to see you still here, Sayu. Unless... Is this some sort of trick?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 30a.ogg Sayu: The Traveler is interested in ninjutsu and wants to learn together.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 04.ogg Kano Nana: Is that so? Though it is strictly forbidden for some techniques to be taught to outsiders...
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 05.ogg Kano Nana: But I suppose you are an exception in this case.
 Did you find out more about the ambush thing?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 06.ogg Kano Nana: Indeed, I did. I was able to determine that the Yashiro Commission had no intent of carrying out such a mission. They are now investigating the origins of these orders.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 07.ogg Kano Nana: Rest assured, the related personnel are all aware of the situation and there should be no further threats to your safety.
 Good to hear.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 08.ogg Kano Nana: Well then, let us begin your ninjutsu training.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 09.ogg Kano Nana: Please, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), follow us.
(Proceed to Operation Substitution)

Searching for the Commissioner[]

(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Badawi, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19059 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: (I still need some more Mora...)
(Approach Badawi)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: Kaveh? What are you doing here...?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: I—I've changed my mind. Uh... I was overreacting earlier. Can we try discussing the project some more?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 badawi 02.ogg Badawi: My apologies as well. Now that I think about it, some of my requests were indeed a bit unreasonable.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 badawi 03.ogg Badawi: If I chose you to create the design for my project, I should have a bit more faith in your vision.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Ah, thank you for understanding. Mutual trust is the basis for good communication. Now that we've got that out of the way, I think we can have a more productive conversation.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: To be perfectly honest... your commission request has been the most peculiar one I've ever received.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Even now, I still know nothing about the building's intended purpose. All I know is that you want to build something in the desert for public use.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: I am aware that overly specific requests will restrain the architect's artistic freedom. However, knowing nothing about the intended purpose of the building also means I have no idea if I'm on the right track.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: I've produced several draft proposals for you to choose from, and you've rejected every single one. If we don't get on the same page, it could be a decade before we can finally break ground on this project.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 badawi 04.ogg Badawi: Yes, I've given this some thought already. I think we can go with the general direction of the latest proposal that you just showed me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 badawi 05.ogg Badawi: It's just...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Hmm? Just what?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 badawi 06.ogg Badawi: Putting the building design aside, can we get some less expensive materials for the floor tiles? I know someone in the business, and the red bricks he sells can go for pretty cheap.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 badawi 07.ogg Badawi: The timber here as well. We should be able to find some substitutes...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: Ahh... Please give me a moment, my head's starting to hurt again. Just please hold on for a second...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: So, let me get this straight, you want to reduce the cost of the project, right? But if we implement your suggestions, then I'm afraid we have to scrap the entire design.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: Architectural design cannot be neatly split into discrete parts — any change to one part of the design will affect the quality of the whole thing. I decided to utilize high-end timber for this section because the weight-bearing structure requires the supporting materials to be durable and strong.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: Same with the tiles... Switch them out, and the entire mural will have to be redesigned. More importantly, if we make such a change, both its practical functionality and aesthetic value will take a great hit.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: If all you need is a building with a roof that can keep people dry in the rain, you shouldn't have commissioned me. Many architects would be able to build you one of those while charging far less in commission fees.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 badawi 08.ogg Badawi: Actually, I... *sigh* Please tell me, are you absolutely sure that there's no room for any changes in this draft of the design?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: I think the most important thing for me is to understand what you would actually like to get. If you could tell me more about your vision, I might be able to work with the design some more. You are the client, after all. You should have the final say on how the project turns out.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 badawi 09.ogg Badawi: I... want to build something unique. Something quiet and warm inside, a refuge that can block out the world outside.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 badawi 10.ogg Badawi: I want all who enter this building to be able to temporarily forget everything that's going on outside of the building, and just focus on their task at hand.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: Hmm... that's a bit more information than last time, but it's still extremely vague. To put it another way, every rich person who wants to build a mansion for themselves would request something like this.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: We've gone through many proposals, and this draft is already the cheapest one. Cutting costs by substituting building materials will not only detract from the overall effect of the building, it also won't save you much Mora in the grand scheme of things.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 badawi 11.ogg Badawi: Thank you for giving it so much thought. Please give me some more time to mull over the budget... I'll get back to you once I've figured out a solution.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 badawi 12.ogg Badawi: I still have a few business meetings that I must attend, so I'm afraid I'll have to leave for now. You can just leave the proposal as-is. I'll get in touch once I've given it some more thought.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: ...
 Why do I feel like he's hiding something?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: I also have a similar feeling.
 Should we follow him and see if anything unusual comes up?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: Uh... Is that really okay? I mean, what he does now is none of our business...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: He does seem really suspicious, though. He dresses like a rich person, but when you talk to him, he hardly sounds the part.
 He sounds super frugal, too.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 20.ogg Kaveh: That's actually pretty common. Not all rich people are spendthrifts. Many are just as if not more stingy than him.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 21.ogg Kaveh: The more Mora some people have, the more they love interfering with people's lives — like constantly reminding you to pay back your debts, or hinting every other day that it's time for you to pay rent.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 22.ogg Kaveh: Actually, now that I think about it, I'm not even sure this person really wants to work on this project with me. Putting his vague requests aside, he's still finding excuses to procrastinate even when we've decided on a plan.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905901 kaveh 23.ogg Kaveh: Who knows how long construction will take if he keeps delaying things like this... We should find him again and get some clearer answers. The sooner we can break ground on this, the better.
(After following the client)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905902 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Huh, where did he go? I could have sworn he went this way...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905902 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Let's keep looking.
You search the area with Kaveh, but find no trace of Badawi...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905903 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Hey, look! Isn't that Badawi? It sure looks like him, but he's dressed completely different now. What is he up to?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905903 roya 01.ogg Roya: Didn't I tell you before? I'm not looking for more workers.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905903 roya 02.ogg Roya: Plus, aren't you a bit old for physical labor? If something happens to you, I won't be able to pay for it.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905903 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: Oh, you won't have to worry about that. I grew up as an Eremite mercenary, and worked in the desert my entire life. My body's still in great shape.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905903 badawi 02.ogg Badawi: I don't have many talents, but I still have my muscle. If you need someone to unload goods or drive away sumpter beasts, I'm your man.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905903 roya 03.ogg Roya: You used to be an Eremite mercenary?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905903 badawi 03.ogg Badawi: I know there are a lot of bad apples in our ranks, but most are just trying to make a living. We're not that greedy by nature, and will do our best when given a job.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905903 roya 04.ogg Roya: Hmm, let me think...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905903 roya 05.ogg Roya: I'm sorry, but I still can't take you in. I don't have any open positions right now and don't have the Mora for anything more. How about this... why don't you try your luck somewhere else.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905903 badawi 04.ogg Badawi: Okay, okay... *sigh*
Media:vo kvcop001 1905903 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: He used to be a member of the Eremites? Huh, from the way he dressed, I would have thought he was a merchant from the rainforest... Let's ask him about it.

Concealed Circumstances[]

(Talk to Badawi)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: We meet again.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: Huh? Why are you guys here?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: That's what we wanted to ask you. Who are you? Why did you dress up like a merchant to talk to me about our project?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 02.ogg Badawi: ...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: There's no need for us to continue this project if you still want to keep hiding things from us. I don't work with individuals I can't trust.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 03.ogg Badawi: Believe me, I didn't have any bad intentions... It's just...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 04.ogg Badawi: Alright, there's no point hiding anything anymore. The building I'm trying to commission you for is not really a personal residence for me, but rather a library for children living in the desert.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: A library...? Funded entirely by yourself? Shouldn't this be the responsibility of the Akademiya?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: I've heard that the Akademiya will be looking to prioritize the desert with the allocation of educational resources and materials. It sent over a large shipment of regular goods just last month.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 05.ogg Badawi: You're right, and I was aware of these happenings as well. I just figured... what I want to do is a separate effort from what's already being done by the Akademiya.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 06.ogg Badawi: The desert is too vast. Even if the Akademiya spends a lot of effort trying to disseminate knowledge in those parts, it might still take decades, if not centuries, to reduce the educational gap that already exists between the two regions.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 07.ogg Badawi: And what's more... I don't know if the Akademiya would ever reverse its stance in the future.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 08.ogg Badawi: All I know is that as a desert-dweller, we should not wait passively for good things to happen to us. If we only did that, we'd never be able to stand up and hold our heads high.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 09.ogg Badawi: I don't have much longer left on this world, so I just want to use whatever time I have to contribute something to my homeland.
 Why didn't you just tell us that from the start?
 Why did you feel like you needed to lie?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 10.ogg Badawi: I didn't want you to know that I came from the desert. I've lived in the desert my entire life, and there wasn't anyone here that I could trust. I figured I needed as much safety as I could get.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: To the point that you even disguised your identity? That's certainly taking "playing it safe" to the next level... Hold on, don't tell me you've also been scammed before?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 11.ogg Badawi: When I first came to Sumeru City, I brought a lot of Mora hoping to find an architect that I could work with.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 12.ogg Badawi: Someone agreed to take on the project, and even took a sum of Mora from me, but then disappeared without a trace.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 13.ogg Badawi: After that, I heard that there are a lot of untrustworthy people in this business. Some would run as soon as they've been paid, while others would deliberately use expensive materials and take a cut of the construction funding.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 14.ogg Badawi: I spent a while collecting information in the city, and eventually learned that you're the most famous architect in all of Sumeru. I figured that you wouldn't need to make Mora by scamming people, so I decided to reach out to you...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 15.ogg Badawi: By the way, how did you know I was scammed? I don't think I've ever mentioned that to anybody.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Just a hunch. A while ago, I accepted an offer to work on a project in the desert, and was also scammed out of a large sum of Mora.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: I ran into someone who was living in a pretty run-down house. I noticed a load-bearing wall on the verge of collapse and suggested that I build a new house for him.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: He said that he had no way to pay for it, so I loaned him some of my own Mora, and told him to get some stone and timber from the local vendors. Soon after that, I found out that he had gone gambling with all the money, and lost everything, down to the last coin.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: And after that, he even borrowed Mora from me twice more, using a different excuse each time. I didn't even suspect him of any wrongdoing until he hired a group of mercenaries and tried to ambush me in his own house.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: According to him, I looked like an easy target because I was an Akademiya scholar who didn't have any family or friends in the desert. Hmph, what kind of person would just look at someone else and think "this guy looks like an easy target"?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 16.ogg Badawi: ...Those kinds of things do happen every once in a while, yes. Folks like him are the exact reason why us desert-dwellers' reputation have gone down the drain! I must apologize to you on their behalf.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: It's alright. You were also scammed by someone from Kshahrewar, after all. I should apologize to you on their behalf.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: Ultimately, neither of our experiences had anything to do with the desert or the rainforest. People who are new to an area are always easy targets for criminals.
 Bad people are everywhere.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: Yeah, you'll find both good and bad people everywhere... I can't understand the logic of those who like to take advantage of others, but I have to accept their existence as a fact of life.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: Anyway, I digress. Let's return to the topic at hand. Did you keep rejecting my designs because you thought I was deliberately using expensive materials to take a cut as a middleman?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 17.ogg Badawi: That's what I was afraid of initially, yes. I eventually understood that you weren't out to cheat me... but unfortunately, I still don't have nearly enough Mora to pay for the design you proposed.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 18.ogg Badawi: I've done the math, and know that we should be able to make it if we cut some corners. However, after our conversations, I can see that you're passionate about your design, and I'm quite fond of the proposal as well.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 19.ogg Badawi: So... I decided to try and see if I can afford your proposal as is. I've been looking for work every day, and in another month, I should be able to cobble together enough Mora together to meet the budget.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: By "cobble together," you mean you're going to spend your entire life's savings on this project? But then, what will you do if something unexpected comes up, and you find yourself stuck with no emergency fund?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 20.ogg Badawi: To be honest, I haven't really thought about that. I mean... when you've lived to be my age and something happens, you can't really call it "unexpected" anymore.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 21.ogg Badawi: All I want is to build this library before I leave this world, so that the children of the future would have some books to read, and the desert-dwellers would be able to learn their letters and pick up some practical knowledge.
 You seem really passionate about this project.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 22.ogg Badawi: A while ago, I heard that the Akademiya had decided to recruit a number of exceptional children from the desert. Of course, this is welcome news. But as someone who spent their entire life in the desert, I still have a few concerns.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 23.ogg Badawi: I know the desert life and can predict what the problems will be. Many children from the desert have had neither the interest nor the proper environment to learn.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 24.ogg Badawi: So even if the Akademiya would take them in, once they enter the halls, they might find themselves surrounded by other children who look and act very differently from them. And as a result, they might become socially isolated.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: ...Yes, I can imagine that.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: My father passed away at an early age. Even though I had a good number of friends during my years at the Akademiya, for some time, I still sensed many critical looks in my direction.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: I'm sure a child coming all the way from the desert will have an even harder time.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 20.ogg Kaveh: But let's bring this back to the building itself. I think you said that you want this building to be quiet and warm, with its doors serving as a solid barrier to block out the sound and fury outside and allow one to focus on the book in their hands.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 21.ogg Kaveh: Building it according to the current plan will be quite costly. Even if I don't charge you any commission fees, I don't think we'd be able to keep it under your budget...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 22.ogg Kaveh: Hmm... Any ideas on what we can do?
 Can we try a slightly different style? (This dialogue option leads to Field Study.)
(+2 Hearts)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 23.ogg Kaveh: A slightly different style? Hmm, give me a minute...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 24.ogg Kaveh: Most architects would probably prioritize cutting costs and removing extra features in this situation. Indeed, converting the building into a simple bungalow would solve most of our problems... However, I do not think this would be the best solution.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 25.ogg Kaveh: While it's true that the aesthetic value of a building is often viewed as an afterthought, neglecting it has some long-term negative consequences. It is especially undesirable in this situation as the library will serve a high number of children, many of whom would have never been exposed to structures that may be considered elegant or beautiful.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 26.ogg Kaveh: To completely give up on the more aesthetic design would mean stripping the children of an opportunity to appreciate the beauty of architecture. I share Badawi's sentiments in wanting to preserve a more complex design.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 27.ogg Kaveh: However, if we can reduce the ornate aspects of the design while maintaining its fundamental elegance... Which is to say, we won't touch the arches and stone pillars, but make changes elsewhere... Hmm, this is definitely a first...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 28.ogg Kaveh: To make up for the loss of regular details, we would need to put a lot of extra effort into the layout, lines, and color.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 25.ogg Badawi: I see... Would that really be okay?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 29.ogg Kaveh: It just increases the difficulty of the design. You should feel lucky that out of all the architects in the city, you chose to approach me. Most of the others would have given up on this project by now.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 30.ogg Kaveh: As for inspiration... I think I might have something in mind, but I'd need to visit the site to make sure. Where do you want this place to be built? Tell me the exact location.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 26.ogg Badawi: Aaru village [sic]. Although it wasn't my childhood home, I think it'll be the best site for such a building.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 31.ogg Kaveh: Okay, then we can pay a visit to Aaru Village.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 27.ogg Badawi: Is there something I can do for you? I've already caused you a lot of trouble before, and now, you're revising the design again because of me... Which draft are we even on now? It's making me feel terribly guilty.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 32.ogg Kaveh: Let me think... You said you used to be an Eremite mercenary, right? In that case, you could help us clear out some monsters that are blocking the way to Aaru village.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 33.ogg Kaveh: We want to keep the roads clear, and reduce the loss of materials during transport to a minimum. If everything goes well, that'll help us save some Mora.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 28.ogg Badawi: Alright, just leave it to me! Haha, if there's anything I'm good at, it's clearing out monsters!
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 34.ogg Kaveh: What are you waiting for, then? Let's pack up, and get ready to go.
(Go to Field Study)
 Would any other merchants be willing to sponsor the project? (This dialogue option leads to Attempted Persuasion.)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 35.ogg Kaveh: Sponsor the project? You mean... convince wealthy merchants to join our cause, and pool their money together to build the library?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 36.ogg Kaveh: That does make sense. A library is a big project, and it's going to be hard to fund it with just a single person's Mora.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 37.ogg Kaveh: What do you think? If we can find others to sponsor the project, we could potentially increase the size of the building two or threefold.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 badawi 29.ogg Badawi: It's all fine with me. But... where do you think we'll be able to find these sponsors?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 38.ogg Kaveh: Well... You're right, if I really think about it, I'm not too familiar with many big name merchants...
 Can we ask Dori?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 39.ogg Kaveh: Her? Hard pass. With her shrewd and greedy personality, she would never put Mora into something like this.
 Maybe she can connect us with some of her contacts?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 40.ogg Kaveh: Hmm, now there's an idea. She probably won't say no if all she'll need to do is to make some introductions instead of spending Mora.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905904 kaveh 41.ogg Kaveh: Let's go and pay her a visit.

The Jade Chamber Once More[]
 Quest DescriptionYou receive an invitation from Ningguang, she seems to have something to discuss with you.

(Approach Ningguang)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Huh?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Ah, it looks like all our problems are solved. Welcome to the Jade Chamber, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 baishi 01.ogg Baishi: Oh, great! I have no idea what we would have done otherwise...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 baiwen 01.ogg Baiwen: I didn't think we'd really manage to get you here.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 baixiao 01.ogg Baixiao: This was a last-minute situation, and you're the one we trust the most.
 What's happened?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: To put it simply, we are just looking for the right person to help. We had a very long discussion about it, but to no avail.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: I have tasked my three most trusted secretaries with overseeing an important auction tomorrow. This, however, leaves their regular duties unattended to, and the work cannot afford to go undone.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: The nature of their day-to-day work is highly sensitive and confidential, so whomever I ask to fill in needs to be someone I can trust, and who doesn't have a conflict of interest.
 So you thought of me?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: Yes. You were the person who came to mind. We may not have spent a great deal of time together... but I do place a great deal of trust in you.
 I don't think I'm up to this task...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: There's no need to be quite so modest. Actually, you were the first person I thought of. I place a great deal of trust in you. Besides, we haven't thought of any other suitable candidates.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: To me, this work is highly sensitive and of utmost importance, though I'm sure you will find it to be mundane at best. It would not surprise me if you can't bear the tedium or can't make the time...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: And yet, despite this, I thought it could do no harm to ask the question, on the off chance that you are interested.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: As it happens, I was just having a discussion on backup plans with my secretaries before you arrived.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 baixiao 02.ogg Baixiao: But... the outcome of that discussion was that we couldn't think of a suitable alternative...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 baiwen 02.ogg Baiwen: This is a good reminder that we should always have a contingency plan for everything.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: Anyway. This may add to the debt of gratitude I owe you, but the fact is, your arrival here has rescued what was fast becoming a rather dire situation indeed.
 If I have what it takes, I'll do it.
 How tedious are we talking?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: I wouldn't worry. It's all work you'll be quite familiar with — planning trips, gathering pertinent information, that sort of thing.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: All basic skills required by competent adventurers, if I'm not mistaken.
 Okay. I'll give it a try...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 baishi 02.ogg Baishi: If you have any questions about your work, I will answer them shortly.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 baishi 03.ogg Baishi: The administrative work Lady Ningguang touched upon just now is only one aspect. You'll also be required to cater for Lady Ningguang's basic daily needs, such as clothing and meals, and be on call for any other requests she may have.
 That's, um... Wow.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: Don't be mistaken, I won't put you in a difficult position. And I will fully respect your judgment.
 ...Why can't you do it yourself?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: None of this is hard work, but there is a lot to do and it's highly repetitive. Having a dedicated staff member deal with it exclusively means that everyone has clearly delineated duties and can focus on their own work.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 16.ogg Ningguang: Simply put, this is about maximizing overall efficiency.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 ningguang 17.ogg Ningguang: Alright. Please proceed to the office. Baishi will go over the work with you in more detail.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913101 baishi 04.ogg Baishi: Yes, Lady Ningguang. Okay, let's go.

Scheduling the Day[]

(Talk to Baishi)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 01.ogg Baishi: Before I get into specifics, I want to start by giving you the big picture.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 02.ogg Baishi: As a member of the Liyue Qixing, Lady Ningguang's every move is in the spotlight. Maintaining her perfect image at all times is absolutely essential.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 03.ogg Baishi: My usual job is to be her right hand, to maintain her image, and take care of all her worries.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 04.ogg Baishi: For example, arranging her daily schedule, picking out clothes for her... dressing her, applying her perfume...
 Your eyes are really sparkling right now...
 Are you in a trance, or?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 05.ogg Baishi: Ahem. You misunderstand me. I am simply trying to impress upon you the sheer importance of the work you will be undertaking!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Baishi has always been very passionate about her work. I can leave any task in her capable hands and rest assured that her performance will be nothing short of exemplary.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: I'm sure she was simply trying to share some of her enthusiasm, in the hopes that you may find it infectious.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 06.ogg Baishi: Th—Thank you, Lady Ningguang!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 07.ogg Baishi: Back to the topic at hand. Let's get into the details.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 08.ogg Baishi: Baixiao and Baiwen handle tasks that require enormous experience, while I'm mainly responsible for organizing her daily scheduled and making sure she is well-fed, dressed for any occasion, and that all her needs are met.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 09.ogg Baishi: I can go through the methods I use and give you some pointers based on my experience to ensure that you are fully equipped to perform your duties.
 It's just basic daily routine stuff. It'll be fine.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 10.ogg Baishi: All in a day's work for the Traveler, hmm? Great, then I'll skip that and just get to the handover of duties.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 11.ogg Baishi: Currently, there are 133 items that have yet to be scheduled, 17 of which are high-importance and...
 ...133!?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 12.ogg Baishi: Yes. I did try to make a start in advance, but only got as far as roughly prioritizing the tasks before I ran out of time.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 13.ogg Baishi: I'll go through the most important items with you in more detail. If there's anything you don't understand, feel free to stop me with questions at any point.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 14.ogg Baishi: First is the periodic meeting with the representatives of the Eight Trades, after that, fielding opinions on revisions to the current tax legislation.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 15.ogg Baishi: Then, a discussion with Lady Keqing on issues relating to time restrictions on land conveyance deals. Following that, there's a Q&A session with all the major commerce guilds.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 16.ogg Baishi: Right after that, there's—
 Hold up! Do I really have to understand Ningguang's work in all this detail just to organize her schedule?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 17.ogg Baishi: Yes, you do. To the uninitiated, scheduling may sound like a simple process of matching tasks to time slots, but there is actually far more to it than that.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 18.ogg Baishi: You need to take travel time into account, along with a whole spectrum of potential issues that can arise...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 19.ogg Baishi: Ample knowledge of all outside factors that may weigh upon your plan A is essential to devise a workable contingency plan.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 20.ogg Baishi: I assume this is all making sense... unless you had any other questions at this point?
 (She's not going to keep going on like this... is she?)
 No, I think I'm good...
 (Actually, I didn't understand any of it...)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 21.ogg Baishi: Good, then let's press on — we're tight on time here, and there's a lot to get through. And we still need to leave enough time for you to prepare Lady Ningguang's schedule.
 Uh, n—no need.
 I think I know how to approach it now.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 22.ogg Baishi: Already? Wow... you're a fast learner. Very good, this will be much more efficient.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: Wonderful. Then I'll be counting on you to provide my schedule for tomorrow.
 I'll do my best.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: I'm grateful for your assistance. Now, I will leave you here in peace to proceed with your work. I still have a few items from today's schedule that need addressing.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: If anything else is unclear, you can ask Baishi.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 23.ogg Baishi: Take care, Lady Ningguang!
 (Alright. Time to make a serious effort.) (This dialogue option leads to Business as Usual.)
You hand over the schedule you made to Baishi.

(Opens Rigorous Schedule)

1. Eat, wash up, change, get ready to go out.
2. Meet businesswoman Luo Qiao at Liuli Pavilion, eat lunch.
3. Meet three informants and exchange information.
4. Go to Yuehai Pavilion for a conference.
5. Light meal, negotiate any outstanding matters from the conference, return to Jade Chamber.

The specific times for the first three items are flexible and progress-dependent. The conference in Item 4 is scheduled for the evening. Arriving early is recommended.

Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 24.ogg Baishi: Good. You factored in both priority and efficiency, and produced a rigorous and well-structured schedule. You've clearly considered it from every angle.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 25.ogg Baishi: Excellent work. You've got quite a knack for this.
 Too kind.
 My brain is fried now, though...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 26.ogg Baishi: Please be here at the Jade Chamber tomorrow morning before Lady Ningguang wakes up, and start preparing based on the schedule.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 27.ogg Baishi: With you helping out here, we will be able to focus fully on the auction — it will be quite a complicated affair.
 I hope everything goes well tomorrow.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 28.ogg Baishi: I hope so, too. You must be exhausted. Make sure you get an early night tonight.
(Proceed to Business as Usual)
 (Alright. Time to avoid anything complicated.) (This dialogue option leads to Time Off!.)
You hand over the schedule you made to Baishi.

(Opens Simple Schedule)

One day off!

Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 29.ogg Baishi: Um, don't you think that this schedule is a bit of a light load?
 Ningguang hasn't taken a vacation in a long time, I'll bet?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 30.ogg Baishi: That's true. Lady Ningguang has a lot of work to attend to, and frankly, she doesn't have many opportunities to rest.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 31.ogg Baishi: We do sometimes worry about her health. But her attitude is very Mora-driven. If by taking a break there's a chance she'll lose Mora, she'll never agree to it.
 But the work will always be there.
 No amount of Mora is worth ruining your health for.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 32.ogg Baishi: Ah, I see where you're coming from... Yes. You have a point.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 33.ogg Baishi: Alright then, let's go with your plan. I'm sure Lady Ningguang has plenty she wants to talk about with you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 34.ogg Baishi: There's a lot of things that need doing over at the auction venue, so I will be leaving you now.
 I hope everything goes well tomorrow.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913102 baishi 35.ogg Baishi: I hope so, too. You must be exhausted. Make sure you get an early night tonight.
(Proceed to Time Off!)

Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: I go there pretty much every time I have a day off. You can't help but be in a good mood when you're surrounded by cute animals.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Failing that, we could go downtown if you'd prefer?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: Narukami Island will be packed right now, so we could go to Ritou instead.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: Hehe, back to where we first met. I haven't been there in a long time, actually.

 I wanna see these cats and dogs!

Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: There's a sakura tree in Hanamizaka where I go to feed them. Let's meet there in a short while.

"Honorary Knight!"[]
 Quest DescriptionIn accordance with your growing fame as the Honorary Knight, one of your junior Knights of Favonius would like to receive your guidance...

(Approach Noelle)
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 01.ogg ???: Is that... the Honorary Knight? Hello!
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? Seems like someone's calling out to you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! Let's go check it out!
(Walk up to Noelle)
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 02.ogg ???: I finally get to meet you, Honorary Knight.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: I'm Noelle, a maid of the Knights of Favonius.
 The Knights of Favonius have... maids?
 Is this... "maid-knight" attire?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Ah —  apologies... I've yet to officially join the Knights.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: As a maid, and in order to be worthy of this armor, I'm currently undergoing the Knights of Favonius Chivalric Training.
 "Chivalric Training"?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Yes... I haven't passed the selection trials yet, but I've been asking senior knights for advice on how to become a true Knight of Favonius.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: ...I asked Amber how to make a Baron Bunny, and Kaeya's been keeping me busy with various small tasks...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: I even asked the Spark Knight to pass on her experiences, although... Master Jean grounded us shortly after...
 You seem to be... working hard...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Actually... I have always wanted to receive guidance from the Honorary Knight.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: I—I was worried that it might be too... presumptuous to ask...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: I've seen you on the streets of Mondstadt occasionally, but I've always been too busy to disturb you...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: I just finished today's cleaning for the Knights and was about to start my training when I saw you!
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: I... If it's not too much trouble... could I ask you for some guidance on my Chivalric Training?
 You know... it's okay not to be a knight.
(Go to Branch 1)
 Of course, where do you want to start?
(Go to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 You know... it's okay not to be a knight.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: So as a senior knight... this is your suggestion?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: But... as a maid, I'm only authorized to deal with smaller tasks.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: The Knights of Favonius is the strongest shield that Mondstadt has. How can I defend the people if I'm only ever dealing with minor matters!
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: That's why I've always wanted to become a real knight of Favonius, to have the power to help more people!
 A maid is a respectable position too, I'd like to become one.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: Huh? Y—You're joking hehehe... right?
 No matter how small the tasks, they still need someone to take care of them. I do small tasks all the time.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: Really? Even the Honorary Knight?
 I'm constantly running errands.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 20.ogg Noelle: ...I thought the Honorary Knight would only ever be busy with powerful enemies like Stormterror...
 The strength to fight powerful enemies only comes with the experience gained during the completion of smaller tasks.
 Besides, you don't exactly mind such tasks, right?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 21.ogg Noelle: Well... that is true...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 22.ogg Noelle: Come to think of it, whenever I see you in Mondstadt, you do always seem to be in a hurry...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 23.ogg Noelle: And the fact is... you're hurrying to help others...
 Go back to Mondstadt and see if there are people who need help.
 Think of every small task as a kind of training.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 24.ogg Noelle: Oh... Okay, back to Mondstadt it is! Time for today's training to officially begin!

All of Life Is Training[]
 Quest DescriptionNoelle, who aims to become a Knight of Favonius, has shared her troubles with you and hopes that you'll be able to help her with her chivalric training. At your suggestion, Noelle decides to start small...

(Follow Noelle and approach the bridge)
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Your point of view on these matters has truly been eye-opening for me, I have a lot to learn!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Just like you said, from now on, I'm going to treat helping people with smaller tasks as a part of my training!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: ...Just thinking about it makes me feel more motivated than ever!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow... Noelle's motivated alright!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: She's got that "gimme a commission before I take 'em all" vibe!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 01.ogg ???: Someone—! Anyone—!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Who's that? I—I need to help!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Noelle! Whoa... she's fast... Let's catch up with her!
(Approach Noelle)
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: ...There, there, take your time, try and take a deep breath first...
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 02.ogg ???: *catches breath* ...And finally... I was saved...
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Well my name's Noelle. Don't worry sir, everything's all right. I'll be protecting you from now on.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: So... where are you from? I don't think we've met in Mondstadt before.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 03.ogg ???: Thanks... I... I'm not from Mondstadt.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 04.ogg Alois: My name is Alois. I'm a traveling merchant.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 05.ogg Alois: I was on my way to Mondstadt to acquire some of the reputed local wines... so I could take them back to Liyue... Little did I know...
 ...Mm-hmm...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 06.ogg Alois: Uh... Little did I know I'd run into savage monsters on the way! I mean... savage! They were twice my height!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 07.ogg Alois: I was so scared I ran all the way here, until I just couldn't run anymore... Thank goodness I found you and this... uh... maid.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: It's okay, Mr. Alois. We're not far from Mondstadt.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Although I'm just an ordinary maid, the small task of escorting a visitor to the city is certainly within my power.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 08.ogg Alois: Uh, escort me to Mondstadt? Perfect! Let's go...
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: But, wait a moment... as a traveling merchant, you must have some luggage and some goods?
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Don't worry. No matter the quantity, I'll carry them for you!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 09.ogg Alois: Luggage? Goods? Uhh...
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 10.ogg Alois: Yes! I remember now. The savage monsters I encountered? That's when I lost them!
 I can get them back for you.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 11.ogg Alois: No, no... no need! These monsters are ferocious! Three times my height!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 12a.ogg Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 12b.ogg Noelle: Oh, rest easy — (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) is Mondstadt's Honorary Knight. No monster is too ferocious for (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍).
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 12.ogg Alois: H—Honorary Knight? Then you're a member of the Knights of Favonius?
 Where did you see those monsters?
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 13.ogg Alois: I, uhh... I—I can't remember exactly. I was too busy running.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 14.ogg Alois: —Probably near that crossing in front of us... b—but I can't be sure... *sigh* Never mind...
 Back soon.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 15.ogg Alois: Wait... w—wait a minute! My chest! Argh! A sudden pain in my chest! It must be all that running. Let's look for those things a little bit later...
(He lowers himself to the ground)
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: Oh! Chest pain? ...Here, I've got you. Hold my arms and lie down slowly.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: Now do your best to relax. I will examine you.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 16.ogg Alois: Uhh... p—perhaps I... maybe you...
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: I'm sorry, I must stay here to watch over our visitor, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). It looks like you'll need to handle the monsters. Oh — and please be careful!
(Talk to Alois and Noelle)
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 01.ogg Alois: No, no, it's okay... I'll be fine with a bit of rest, don't worry about me...
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Sorry! If you really don't want to be examined, I still need to take care of you!

(Approach the crossing)
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Strange... No trace of any large monsters here...
(Approach the fallen carriage)
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Woah, here they come!
(Defeat the slimes)
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Eh? It's just a few ordinary slimes!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Paimon didn't see any goods on the road. Is this the right place?
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Let's head back to Noelle.

(Talk to Noelle)
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Back so soon... A true senior knight!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Did you see Mr. Alois's luggage on the way?
 Not a trace.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 02.ogg Alois: Uh, perhaps the monsters ate it?
 Only saw a few monsters...
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 03.ogg Alois: So there were monsters...
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 04.ogg Alois: Didn't I tell you! It's dangerous!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Oh, you're not hurt, are you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 They were only a few slimes.
 They weren't exactly twice your height.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 05.ogg Alois: Uh... um... w—what I meant was...
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 06.ogg Alois: When they jumped, they were thrice — ahem — twice as tall as me!
 Twice or thrice...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 07.ogg Alois: ...W—Why are you looking at me like that? Even if they were just slimes, I couldn't have fought them off!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: *sigh* What can we do? If even the Honorary Knight can't find them...
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 08.ogg Alois: Heh... I'm just a traveling merchant, you never know what's gonna happen out here...
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 09.ogg Alois: Oh well, looks like Mondstadt was never meant to be, perhaps next time...
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: I'm very sorry... In these circumstances, I must ask you to register the quantity and nature of your lost property with the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: I know that the Knights will do their best to help you recover your goods!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 10.ogg Alois: Ah!?
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 11.ogg Alois: No, no, no! I—I couldn't possibly trouble the Knights of Favonius. This matter... it really is beneath them.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: On the contrary, it's the duty of the Knights to look after any visitors traveling to and from Mondstadt.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: As a maid, I must do my best in receiving and escorting such visitors.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: But then... perhaps there's something keeping you from going to the Knights?
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 12.ogg Alois: Heh... No! Absolutely nothing!
 Noelle, can we talk for a moment?
(Aside)
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Mm? Everything okay?
 This fellow seems suspicious to me.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Well... actually, I noticed that too.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: But since we don't have any evidence of wrongdoing, he deserves the benefit of the doubt.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: This gentleman was seeking help at the gates of Mondstadt, which makes him a guest of the city.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: Therefore, I must carry out my maidly duties.
 You have a point...
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: Mm-hmm, thank you for understanding!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 13.ogg Alois: Hey... what are you discussing? So what's next?
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: Oh... Sorry to keep you waiting!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: We've talked it over, and we've decided to escort you back to Mondstadt!
(Proceed to The Art of Hospitality)

Branch 2[]

 Of course, where do you want to start?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 25.ogg Noelle: I—I'd like to get your opinion on something, as a senior knight!
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 26.ogg Noelle: I've been keeping up with my maidly duties and knightly exercises.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 27.ogg Noelle: But training progress has been a little slow...
 Maidly duties?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 28.ogg Noelle: Uh... it's really all just cleaning and tidying...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 29.ogg Noelle: Roughly every other day, I do a major clean-up for the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 30.ogg Noelle: Under the beds, the windowsills... nothing can be left out. The smallest corners are the most likely to gather dust.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 31.ogg Noelle: There are also all kinds of smaller domestic tasks, like preparing Captain Kaeya's eye patch, and helping Ms. Lisa keep her bookshelves in order.
 Knightly exercises?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 32.ogg Noelle: Y'know, just basic strength and endurance training...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 33.ogg Noelle: 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 34.ogg Noelle: And running two laps around Mondstadt as a morning routine.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 35.ogg Noelle: I'm actually incredibly busy every day. It's just that... I always feel like something's missing.
 What you lack is strength!
(Go to Branch 3)
 What you lack is rest.
(Go to Branch 4)

Branch 3[]

 What you lack is strength!
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 36.ogg Noelle: S—Strength...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 37.ogg Noelle: But, I think I'm pretty strong...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 38.ogg Noelle: After he got drunk, I carried Mr. Bruce back to the Knights of Favonius Headquarters myself...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 39.ogg Noelle: I also carried the library's new bookshelves over from Springvale...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 40.ogg Noelle: Even Mr. Huffman said I'm strong.
 Can you show me?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 41.ogg Noelle: Ah! Of course!
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 42.ogg Noelle: However, even though it's only training... I can't raise my sword against the Honorary Knight.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 43.ogg Noelle: I've got it! Let's go to the training ground at the Knights of Favonius Headquarters. There should be some training dummies there.
(Proceed to Noelle's Strength)

Branch 4[]

 What you lack is rest.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 44.ogg Noelle: Rest? But... *sigh* ...I've still got so much work to do.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 45.ogg Noelle: Besides... I'm still not skilled enough. Any free time that I get should be spent training.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 46.ogg Noelle: If I want to become a real knight soon, I have to continue to put in more effort than the others.
 A true knight also needs sufficient rest.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 47.ogg Noelle: But... time is precious... if I rest...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 48.ogg Noelle: I'll feel guilty...
 Stopping for occasional rest is all part of ensuring that you can train to your maximum ability.
 If you're too busy, you won't have time to reflect on your progress and goals.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 49.ogg Noelle: Ohh... I really hadn't thought about that...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 50.ogg Noelle: Resting... for the sake of training...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 51.ogg Noelle: Ohhhh... so that's why Ms. Lisa always has afternoon tea in the library... I get it now!
 In Lisa's case, I'm afraid it's probably just resting for the sake of resting...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 52.ogg Noelle: Huh... Now that you... mention it...
 Never mind. Speaking of tea, let's have some!
 And speaking of tea, let's have some!
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 53.ogg Noelle: Oh! O—Okay!
(Proceed to Fleeting Leisure)

 Quest DescriptionNoelle is usually brimming with energy, but recently she has been cooped up in the library, worrying about something or other...
Emergency Exam Prep[]

Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: "A Thesis on Chivalry"... "Favonius Bladework Fundamentals"... *sigh*
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: So much to learn before the exam, how will I ever get through everything?
 What are you doing?
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Oh, Honorary Knight! Long time no see! Anything you need me to take care of?
 Just came here to say hi...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Oh, thank you, that's very nice of you... It has been quite a while since we last met, hasn't it?
 You don't look so good...
(−1 Heart)
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: I don't? ...I'm sorry to make you worry on my account...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: I've been busy preparing for my exam. Other than for work and training, I've barely left the library.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: The exam is drawing nearer and nearer, but there just seems to be an endless amount of material to review... *sigh*
 Surely, the only exam that could make Noelle so nervous is...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Right, The Knights of Favonius selection exam... *sigh*
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Even though I've already worked for the Knights as a maid for some time, I still need to pass this exam to officially become a Knight.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: It's just that I've failed several times in the past... I still don't know if I can make it this time...
 Can I help?
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: N—no, thank you! I can take care of myself... I hope...
 I can be your study buddy!
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Study buddy? N—no, I... That won't be necessary.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: This is my exam, and I'm taking it to fulfill my dream. Any obstacles I face are mine to overcome.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: Plus, there is still some time to go before the exam arrives. You're the Honorary Knight of Mondstadt, it won't do for me to take up so much of your time.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: But on the day of the exam, if... if you happen to be free...
 Which day is the exam? I'll be there.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: Um, based on the Knights' schedule, I think it should be... half a year from now.
 ...Half a year away?
 I thought it was more imminent...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: But, it's just half a year... don't you think that's quite soon?
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: Even though there is still some time, if I don't make good use of it, it will disappear!
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: I've planned my schedule carefully. If I sleep two hours less each day and finish my work one hour earlier, then as long as I spend all the time I save studying, I should be able to finish these books...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 20.ogg Noelle: There's always coffee if I feel sleepy, and I have some candy on hand just in case I ever feel low on energy...
 Pushing yourself too hard will only affect your exam performance.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 21.ogg Noelle: No, it won't. I've made sure to allocate time for training too — after all, combat is also assessed as part of the examination... Ohh...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 22.ogg Noelle: Did I get too worked up all of a sudden? My vision... seems a bit blurry...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 23.ogg Noelle: No... I still have training tomorrow, I must freshen up...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 24.ogg Noelle: I apologize for letting you see me in such bad shape... I'm okay now.
 Pushing yourself too hard will only make things worse.
 Maybe try to relieve your anxiety first?
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 25.ogg Noelle: Ohh... Every time I think of the exam, I get so nervous. Only studying or training helps to relieve it a little...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 26.ogg Noelle: But in the end, I keep finding new ways in which I'm not prepared, and that makes me even more nervous.
 A change of scenery might do you good.
(Go to Branch 1)
 Don't hide from it. Confront the stress of the exam directly.
(Go to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 A change of scenery might do you good.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 27.ogg Noelle: You mean, a change of location? Hmm... Yes, staying in the Knights Headquarters and in the library all the time does tend to make me feel as if I always have to be studying...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 28.ogg Noelle: But where else could I go? The Cat's Tail? Or the Angel's Share?
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 29.ogg Noelle: Or perhaps somewhere away from the city... Starsnatch Cliff, or Windrise?
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 30.ogg Noelle: I could even make some muffins, grab some napkins, and make a picnic out of it... Ohh, but would that just waste too much time?
 How about farther away? make it a trip to Liyue.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 31.ogg Noelle: A trip? To Liyue!? Oh, I couldn't possibly justify that. In the time it would take to get to Liyue and back, I could have just finished several of my books!
 Liyue has an old saying: "Better to travel ten thousand miles than to read ten thousand books."
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 32.ogg Noelle: Hmm... You really think I shouldn't limit myself to Mondstadt?
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 33.ogg Noelle: Maybe you're right. Mondstadt is symbolized by the wind... But my Vision is a Geo one.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 34.ogg Noelle: Maybe visiting the nation built by the Geo Archon could help me learn something new...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 35.ogg Noelle: Hmm... very well, then... if it's just a quick visit...
(Proceed to Journey to Liyue)

Branch 2[]

 Don't hide from it. Confront the stress of the exam directly.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 36.ogg Noelle: Oh... You mean, studying isn't the only preparation I should be doing?
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 37.ogg Noelle: If I don't overcome my fear of the exam, I will just repeat the same mistakes over and over again...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 38.ogg Noelle: Whenever I encounter something unexpected, I can't think straight... And whenever I start worrying that I might fail again, my mind goes completely blank...
 You could take some more exams to get used to the atmosphere.
(Go to Branch 3)
 You could try to imagine yourself passing the exam.
(Go to Branch 4)

Branch 3[]

 You could take some more exams to get used to the atmosphere.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 39.ogg Noelle: Take some more exams? ...Would that really help me?
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 40.ogg Noelle:  It's true that the more I study, the more unprepared I feel. It's inevitable that I'll run into something unexpected...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 41.ogg Noelle: But if I can simulate the atmosphere of an exam, then I can learn  how to cope with it.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 42.ogg Noelle: But... where would I even go to take one?
 I often take part in the ranking exams of the Adventurers' Guild.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 43.ogg Noelle: The Adventurers' Guild? Now that you mention it, someone once invited me to join them...
 The ranking exams of the Adventurers' Guild can make you stronger.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 44.ogg Noelle: The Adventurers' Guild? You can get stronger just by... passing their exam? ...Ohh, that sounds a little difficult to believe.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 45.ogg Noelle: ...Well, since it's recommended by the Honorary Knight, then... I have to give it a try.
(Proceed to Adventurer's Entrance Exam)

Branch 4[]

 You could try to imagine yourself passing the exam.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 46.ogg Noelle: Imagine myself passing the exam...? Hmm...
 If you passed the selection exam, what kind of knight would you want to become?
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 47.ogg Noelle: What... kind of knight? I—I always thought that just qualifying to be a knight was challenging enough to begin with...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 48.ogg Noelle: The knight that I want to be someday... Ohh... that feels so far away that it's a little difficult to imagine...
 Then let's start with knights closer to home. How about an Outrider, like Amber?
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 49.ogg Noelle: ...An Outrider?
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 50.ogg Noelle: I'm sure Amber would be happy to see the Outriders grow as a team.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 51.ogg Noelle: But my strengths are not in scouting and luring the enemy, and I'm not as agile as Amber. Hmm... I don't know if I would be of any assistance to her...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 52.ogg Noelle: However, I did once get Amber to teach me how to make Baron Bunnies!
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 53.ogg Noelle: If I were to use Baron Bunny to lure the enemy away and protect my fellow knights... I suppose I could do it?
 If you can perform the duty of a qualified knight, then you might feel more confident about the exam.
 Think of it as practicing for when you have to make Baron Bunnies with Amber in the future.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 54.ogg Noelle: Hmm... I still have some of the materials we used when she taught me. There's just a few extra things I'd need...
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 55.ogg Noelle: Making the stuffing requires Pyro Slime Condensate, and the red dye used to grab the enemies' attention can be made from crushed Valberries.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 56.ogg Noelle: It's just that dried Valberries are not very suitable for making dye. I'll need to get some fresh ones from the Stormbearer Mountains.
Media:vo noecop002 1908101 noelle 57.ogg Noelle: So... let's start by going to the Stormbearer Mountains.

One Final Step[]

(Look for the clues the Wisdom Seelie left behind)
(Near the rock formation)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 01.ogg Layla: We're probably getting close now. Let's search this area.
(Upon destroying the rock formation)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 02.ogg Layla: Here it is, just as I thought. The Seelie must have placed it here in advance.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 03.ogg Layla: Let's see what we have this time... Whatever it is, I'm ready.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 04.ogg Layla: Huh? It's a... picture?
 So it's not a riddle this time?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 05.ogg Layla: Guess not. This house looks like it's in Vimara Village. Does the Seelie want us to go there?
 Maybe some sort of trap is waiting for us there.
 This might be the last stop in our search.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 06.ogg Layla: I can't think of any connection I have with Vimara Village, though. I've only been there once, and it was pretty uneventful.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 07.ogg Layla: Whatever the case, the only way we'll know is if we go there.
 Just be sure not to push yourself too hard.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 08.ogg Layla: Thanks, but I'm fine. I'm used to pushing my limits... I know how far I can go.
(Obtain  Picture Left by the Wisdom Seelie)
(Go to the place shown in the picture)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 01.ogg Layla: Let's see... This should be the place. Nothing seems out of the ordinary...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 02.ogg Layla: Maybe the Seelie didn't prepare anything for us this time? Or, does it want us to knock on the door first...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 03.ogg Layla: *groan* If we're wrong about this, it'll be super awkward...
 Layla.
 Calm down.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 04.ogg Layla: You're right. I can't always be like this... Sometimes, it's better to take action than overthink every little thing.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 05.ogg Layla: *inhales and exhales*
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 06.ogg Layla: Uh, hello? Is anyone home?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 01.ogg Mundhir: Coming! Just a moment.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 02.ogg Mundhir: Oh, it's you, Layla. How nice of you to stop by again.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 07.ogg Layla: Huh...?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 08.ogg Layla: Do... do you know me?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 03.ogg Mundhir: Haha, that's no way to greet a friend. Of course I know you.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 04.ogg Mundhir: Is this a friend of yours? Or perhaps a classmate?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 09.ogg Layla: A friend. We, um... I'm having a little trouble with my thesis, and we happened to be passing by...
 What's going on, Layla?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 10.ogg Layla: I—I don't know, either... I don't even know where to begin...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 11.ogg Layla: I recognized him immediately — he's one of the people that was getting robbed by the Treasure Hoarders.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 12.ogg Layla: But he shouldn't know anything about me... He shouldn't even know who I am.
 You said you've been to Vimara Village once...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 13.ogg Layla: Yeah, but that was before the robbery. I was just passing through...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 14.ogg Layla: Even if he saw me, he wouldn't know who I am... He didn't notice me during the robbery.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 05.ogg Mundhir: Is something the matter?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 15.ogg Layla: Uh, I appreciate your kindness, but I really can't remember how we met... I'm sorry.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 06.ogg Mundhir: So you aren't joking...?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 07.ogg Mundhir: Do you still remember when my family and I were being robbed by a gang of Treasure Hoarders?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 16.ogg Layla: Yes, but I don't think I was of much help to you all...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 08.ogg Mundhir: How so? You told us everything yourself the last time we met.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 09.ogg Mundhir: My family and I were surrounded by Treasure Hoarders, and I didn't know what to do. But then, we heard people approaching in the distance.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 10.ogg Mundhir: Those Treasure Hoarders were the first to hear them coming and started to flee the moment they sensed the situation wasn't going their way. They didn't even bother taking anything with them.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 11.ogg Mundhir: I wasn't sure what had happened, but the Treasure Hoarders were scared off. I immediately grabbed my wife and child and got out of there.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 17.ogg Layla: Oh, I see... I'm so glad that you and your family were unharmed.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 12.ogg Mundhir: I thought it was a party of adventurers that happened to pass by, but later you told me that you had spotted us and ran to find help.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 13.ogg Mundhir: You were amazing! You managed to keep a level head, even in the midst of danger.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 14.ogg Mundhir: I know you have a Vision, so those Treasure Hoarders wouldn't have been a match for you. But, they might've harmed me and my family if their backs were pushed against the wall.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 18.ogg Layla: W—Wait, that's not exactly what happened... I still regret not helping out sooner.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 19.ogg Layla: Anyway uh... When did I come here last? I don't seem to remember.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 15.ogg Mundhir: Hmm, it's been some time, but not too long ago. I don't recall exactly when. What's wrong, nothing's coming to mind?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 20.ogg Layla: Nope... I'm sorry, I still can't seem to remember, even after everything you've told me. Maybe I'm just under too much pressure...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 16.ogg Mundhir: You came over and ate with us, and you played games with my son. *sigh* If only we had taken a picture...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 17.ogg Mundhir: Oh! You forgot a package here from that visit. You'll definitely remember once you see it!
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 18.ogg Mundhir: Wait here, I'll go fetch it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 21.ogg Layla: A package? I left a package here...?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 22.ogg Layla: Huh!? Wait, this is it!

Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 23.ogg Layla: This is the talisman that I lost, the one that my mother made for me...
 What the... Is it really the same one you lost?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 24.ogg Layla: Yes, this is definitely it. She made it herself — it's the only one of its kind.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 25.ogg Layla: There's also a letter here. Was I planning to send it to someone? Let's see who the recipient is...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 26.ogg Layla: "To Layla"?
 I'm assuming you aren't in the habit of writing letters to yourself.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 27.ogg Layla: No! I swear I've never done anything like that. What is going on...? Let's open it and see what this is all about.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 28.ogg Layla: "Hello, Layla. It must've been quite the endeavor to follow the Seelie's hints all the way here. Great work."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 29.ogg Layla: "Self-reflection is a wonderful quality to possess, but you'll only end up hurting yourself if you overdo it."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 30.ogg Layla: "Failure is a stranger to no one. The purpose of self-reflection is not to indulge in the pain of failure, but to succeed in your next attempt."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 31.ogg Layla: "If you're reading this letter, then you have succeeded in taking the first step."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 32.ogg Layla: "On the back of this letter is the core information that your thesis is lacking. It's actually been done for a while now — it only feels inconclusive because it's missing a concise summary to tie it all together."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 33.ogg Layla: "I hope that this journey has provided insight for your life ahead. From the bottom of my heart, I wish you courage as you carry onward, and hope that you fulfill the expectations you hold."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 34.ogg Layla: "Always watching over you. Sincerely, the Wisdom Seelie."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 35.ogg Layla: Oh... *sobbing*
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 36.ogg Layla: I thought... I thought we were going to fail. I thought that... everything we did and all the time we spent was for nothing...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 37.ogg Layla: But the Seelie wasn't messing with me after all.
 Could it be that the Wisdom Seelie... is you?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 38.ogg Layla: Hah, I doubt it... I mean, unless I somehow came here while I was unconscious, and don't remember it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 39.ogg Layla: Although having said that, I have heard rumors claiming that I sleepwalk a lot. Hmm...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 40.ogg Layla: But even then, that doesn't necessarily mean that I'm actually the Wisdom Seelie. It could have just helped me while I was sleepwalking.
 Either way, it's safe to say that it's related to the blessing from the stars.
(Stress Value −2)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 41.ogg Layla: I'll write back and ask to meet with the Seelie, and see how it responds.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 42.ogg Layla: Even though I still have a lot of questions, this experience was fruitful enough.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 43.ogg Layla: If it wasn't for your encouragement, I probably would've quit halfway through and holed up in the Akademiya somewhere...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 44.ogg Layla: Perseverance really does pay off.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 19.ogg Mundhir: I'm not sure if I understand what has happened... but it's something good, right?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 45.ogg Layla: Yes, it's something really, really good, and I'm very thankful for it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 20.ogg Mundhir: Well then, since you're already here, why don't you stay and have something to eat? We just finished preparing some food.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 46.ogg Layla: Oh, uh...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 21.ogg Mundhir: C'mon, don't be a stranger. Your friend should join us as well. You can leave your troubles until after the meal.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 22.ogg Mundhir: You must relax and gather your strength so you can take on the challenges ahead, am I right?
 He's right.
(Stress Value −2)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 47.ogg Layla: Alright, thank you all. I can do this!

 Quest DescriptionYou decide to return to the reception...
A Banquet[]

(Enter Hotel Debord)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 argalia 01.ogg Argalia: There you are, Lynette! Where did you disappear to? Leone and I have been looking everywhere for you... Wait, where'd you get the cat?
Bonnie: Meow~
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: I found her outside. Do either of you happen to recognize her?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 leone 01.ogg Leone: Umm... I don't think so. Could belong to one of the guests, I suppose?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: Eh, fair enough. It was a long shot...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 leone 02.ogg Leone: So sorry we couldn't help you, Lynette...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 argalia 02.ogg Argalia: Uh, don't worry! We'll... ask around for you! Leone's probably just being forgetful...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 leone 03.ogg Leone: Maybe you could leave her with us? We'll take her to the reception desk and see if they know anything. And if not... we'll just keep looking!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: Sure. I would help, but I'm a little preoccupied. Sorry to dump this on you.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 argalia 03.ogg Argalia: It's no trouble at all! We're happy to help however we can!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 leone 04.ogg Leone: Also, uh... If it's no trouble, I mean — could we maybe get an autograph? ...And maybe a photo, too?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: Uhh...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 argalia 04.ogg Argalia: Leone! You can't spring that on her now, not while she's working... At least wait until the event's finished!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 argalia 05.ogg Argalia: One last thing, Lynette — Director Merieux's looking for you... We'll take the cat to the front desk now. See you later!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: ...
 You're so popular!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: ...Ugh, I'm not usually required at these kinds of events, so I don't even have an "event mode"... Alright, guess I'd better go see the director.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 corentin 01.ogg Corentin: ...Spectacular choreography, a masterpiece of mise-en-scene! And the performance — oh my, groundbreaking! Dripping with je ne sais quoi! ...My congratulations on another magnificent show, Sir.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 amaury 01.ogg Amaury: Yes, yes... I, for one, was particularly captivated by the clearly allegorical narrative undertones. The Lost Puppet shines a spotlight on the impact of technological advances in our modern society, particularly as they relate to changing modes of emotional expression and the challenge of mutual intelligibility!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 amaury 02.ogg Amaury: Such a pioneering work, so far ahead of its time... A tour de force of avant-garde theater!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 maloney 01.ogg Maloney: Hehehe, I can already see the headlines of tomorrow's newspapers! They will certainly be singing your praise, Director Merieux!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 merieux 01.ogg Merieux: Hahaha... But it was a group effort, of course. To convey emotions in a silent show with no facial expressions, the entire cast had to go above and beyond. Everyone truly outdid themselves...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereportera 01.ogg Friendly Reporter: Speaking of the cast — Gillian, another strong performance from you in Director Merieux's latest show, as of course we've all come to expect from your numerous successful collaborations to date...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 gillian 01.ogg Gillian: That's quite an overstatement. I've only ever played supporting roles...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereporterb 01.ogg Excited Reporter: On that point, you stated a few months ago in an interview that you were looking to secure a leading role in your next show. What led you to the decision to stay in a supporting role this time around?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 gillian 02.ogg Gillian: Umm...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 merieux 02.ogg Merieux: Ahem... We had a discussion about this, and while Lynette hadn't previously performed in an acting role, we were blown away by her talent! And she was a perfect fit for this character...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 merieux 03.ogg Merieux: Quite simply, this was the role she was born to play...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 gillian 03.ogg Gillian: Exactly... I was honored to share the stage with her. Lynette worked extremely hard in all of the rehearsals, and she's an incredibly talented actress...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereportera 02.ogg Friendly Reporter: ...Oh! Lynette's back!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereporterb 02.ogg Excited Reporter: Hey, Lynette, where've you been?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereportera 03.ogg Friendly Reporter: Were you in "standby mode"? Some reports say you switch to that state to "recharge" after a show.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 corentin 02.ogg Corretin: Ah, method acting, of course! Such a compelling portrayal of a mechanical puppet could only be achieved by an actor who lives and breathes their role even while off stage!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 amaury 03.ogg Amaury: ...Those seemingly stilted movements were in fact an inspired portrayal of the character! The ostensible bad acting, in reality was the product of supreme acting skill!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: Oh, uh... I went outside and there was this cat there, so... I played with the cat for a bit...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 corentin 03.ogg Corentin: A cat? ...Hahaha, we've long heard that you were a kind soul as well as an incredible actress. No wonder your debut performance has garnered such popularity!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereportera 04.ogg Friendly Reporter: This show looks on track to break box office records for avant-garde theater. Lynette, any words for the fans?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: Um, not really, no...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 amaury 04.ogg Amaury: Uh... I believe Lynette is trying to say that the act of performance itself is the actor's true means of connecting with their fans...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereportera 05.ogg Friendly Reporter: Ohh, I see! Lynette, any comments?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: ...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: ...Mm-hmm, right. Exactly.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereporterb 03.ogg Excited Reporter: ...But don't you want the fans to know how you're feeling right now? After the hugely successful opening of your first-ever show?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 11.ogg Lynette: That's true.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereporterb 04.ogg Excited Reporter: I'm sure the fans would love to learn a bit more about you, too!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 12.ogg Lynette: ...How interesting.
 [Insight] (Observe Lynette to see how she's doing...)
(If the card is less than 10)

(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Lynette's answers all sound very calm. She seems fine...)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereportera 06.ogg Friendly Reporter: Lynette, how do you find acting compares with performing in a magic show?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereporterb 05.ogg Excited Reporter: What does the future hold for you, Lynette?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: Uhh...
Lynette struggles to keep up as she is inundated with questions...At long last, the crowd eventually disperses...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 14.ogg Lynette: *sobs*...
 Are you alright...?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 15.ogg Lynette: Yeah, it's just... Turns out I can't cope with this stuff even in tea party mode...
 Tea party mode...?
(If the card is greater than or equal to 10)

(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Lynette's voice was so deadpan during the interview. She sounded like an auto-reply bot...)
 Hold on. Lynette has only just finished performing. She needs to recharge.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereporterb 06.ogg Excited Reporter: Oh... Really? I'm so sorry, how rude of me...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereportera 07.ogg Friendly Reporter: Huh? Wait... You're the traveler who's been in the news! Did you come to see the show?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereporterb 07.ogg Excited Reporter: Wow! Are you a fan of Lynette too? Do you have any comments on her first performance?
You and Lynette struggle to keep up as you're both inundated with questions...At long last, the crowd eventually disperses...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 16.ogg Lynette: *sobs*...
 Are you alright...?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 17.ogg Lynette: Yeah, it's just... Turns out even with you here to share the load, I can't cope with this stuff, even in tea party mode...
 Tea party mode...?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 18.ogg Lynette: It's a power-saving mode for participating in conversation at tea parties... Normally, I can get through an entire conversation just with "Mm-hmm," "Oh," "That's true," and "How interesting."
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 19.ogg Lynette: ...But at a tea party, I'm not normally subjected to a constant stream of questions. The energy consumption of that interview just now was three times as much as the average tea party...
 It's a big adjustment. Give it some time.
 Maybe after a few more interviews, you'll get used to it?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 20.ogg Lynette: ...I think I'd rather pray that I never have to do it again.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 cyril 01.ogg Cyril: Lynette — Director Merieux would like you to join the group photo to commemorate the successful opening of the show.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 21.ogg Lynette: ...A group photo?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 cyril 02.ogg Cyril: It's just the members of the troupe, along with Maloney and Corentin. Everyone's waiting for you.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 22.ogg Lynette: Alright then... See you in a minute.
Lynette and Cyril go to do the group photo...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 cyril 03.ogg Cyril: Three, two, one, smile!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 merieux 04.ogg Merieux: ...My thanks to each and every one of you here for your help in making The Lost Puppet a success! The group photo is already being printed as I speak.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 merieux 05.ogg Merieux: You can collect your copy from the first floor after the drinks reception concludes. May it serve as a reminder of this fabulous performance every time you see it!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 maloney 02.ogg Maloney: Merieux! Hahaha, get over here and let's have another drink! There's a few things I need you to glance over for me...
 (Wait, that means... the reception STILL isn't over?)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 23.ogg Lynette: I thought the group photo was the final hurdle... Well, at least there's no more people hounding me with questions. I just need to find somewhere to switch to standby mode, and the time will fly by... I hope.
(Talk to Merieux, Maloney, Corentin, or Amaury, optional)
Observe Crowd: (These people seem to be discussing the content of tomorrow's newspapers. Best not get too close...)
(Approach Furina)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 01.ogg Furina: Ahh... Hotel Debord's Ile flottante is as wonderfully sweet as ever...
 Furina? You managed to get an invite to the drinks reception, too?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 02.ogg Furina: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? Lynette? ...Wait, hold on! What do you mean "managed to get an invite"? I'm an expert in the dramatic arts, of course I was invited!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 03.ogg Furina: Naturally, people wanted to hear my comments on the emerging art form that is the "masked mime show."
 So then, what did you think?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 04.ogg Furina: ...Remarkable. And a very worthwhile artistic endeavor, exploring a character with no lines or facial expressions, who can only communicate how they feel through their movement...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 05.ogg Furina: Your performance was beyond anything I could have imagined, Lynette. Clearly, this was a very suitable role for you indeed...
(If Passive Check succeeds)

(Perception Check Success) You seem to hear a sound...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (If you listen closely, you can hear some small noise coming from the back corner...)

Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 06.ogg Furina: Hmm...? Is... Is something wrong...?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: No... it's nothing. Please, go on.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 07.ogg Furina: Oh...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 08.ogg Furina: ...Basically, I think I'd give it a positive review overall, just not as gushing as the crowd downstairs.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: ...So you thought they were pretty over the top, too?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 09.ogg Furina: Mm... In fairness, it's normal to bring along some vocal supporters for publicity when a new show opens. But still, this was something else...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 10.ogg Furina: ...Then again, I'm no specialist in avant-garde theater. Maybe I'm just not well-acquainted with their review criteria.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 11.ogg Furina: Or maybe it's because I came to the show with some pre-conceived expectations? I did happen to see the original draft of Merieux's script a while back.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: ...What original draft?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 12.ogg Furina: Oh, he didn't show it to you? It must have been a few months ago. He came to me to get some advice from an experienced performer's perspective... and then asked if I could write a few reviews of his new play.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 13.ogg Furina: I had a lot on my plate at the time, so I had to turn him down. I only skimmed a few sections, but they seemed quite different from the final version. I can't say I remember the plot, but...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 14.ogg Furina: I don't know, the protagonist just seemed more... complex, I guess? Especially in the last two scenes. Still a mechanical puppet on the outside, of course, but she seemed to have more emotional depth on the inside.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: Emotional depth...?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 15.ogg Furina: Oh, I'm just thinking aloud here, don't take it to heart. Besides, a script and a play are two very different beasts — there are so many fine details to consider when turning a story into a stage production. More than most people could imagine.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 16.ogg Furina: Especially with a novel art form like a masked mime show. I'm sure Merieux had his reasons for the changes he made.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: ...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 19.ogg Furina: ...Ahem! Change of topic — I see you've escaped the crowds to seek refuge on the second floor. Fame can be overwhelming at first, can't it? Perhaps you'd benefit from hearing about the experiences of a veteran celebrity such as myself?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: No thanks, I'm good. Pretty sure this'll be my first and last time in this situation...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 20.ogg Furina: Hey, at least let me finish! I have top tips on dealing with belligerent reporters, slipping away to hunt down snacks during the intermission...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: ...Tell me everything.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 21.ogg Furina: Hahaha, first take a seat, mon amie! We must partake of Hotel Debord's fine desserts as we talk, lest they go to waste!
The three of you enjoy some delectable treats...As the reception comes to a close, Furina excuses herself and leaves...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: Mmm... That was very educational.
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): ("Educational" isn't the word I'd use... They didn't mention acting once in the whole conversation.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: I expect most of the people downstairs have left by now. Time to grab my copy of the group photo and get home.

A Cloud of Suspicion[]

(Approach the marked location)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: The photo must be in this envelope right here. Ah, it's finally over... Thank you for sticking around for so long.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: If it wasn't for you, I don't know how I would've standby-moded my way through the last few hours...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Any normal person would find an event like this stressful... But enough to warrant Lynette leaving half way through?)
 When you left the event midway... What was the real reason?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: ...
 ...I mean, if you really don't want to talk about it...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: ...It's fine. It's just... it was such a minor thing.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: While I was on stage, there was a moment when I felt like someone was looking at me... It was only for an instant, and I didn't even see who it was. But somehow, I knew it was a look of contempt.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: I got a vague sense of it again during the reception. Like someone was giving me an evil stare. But I couldn't figure out who it was...
(If Passive Check succeeds)

(Contemplation Check Success) You recall something regarding Lynette...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Few people would manage to hide their feelings from Lynette at close range... Whoever it was, they must be a good actor.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: ...Normally, I'm used to lurking in the shadows on the stage and spying on other people. So it was strange, feeling like I was the one being spied on this time.
 Could it have something to do with the original script Furina mentioned?
 Maybe someone's jealous of you? You did land a leading role in your first show.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: Or, someone just took a disliking to me for no real reason. Sometimes, you can like one person and dislike another for equally pointless reasons. Anyway, it was just a momentary stink-eye, that's all. Nothing for you to worry about.
 Okay... Well, if you're not worried, I'm not worried.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: Okay, problem solved. I'm gonna take this envelope and go home now.
Lynette's Envelope...You heartless puppet!You've ruined this work.Hand over the role of lead actress immediately!...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: ...
 What!? It's a threat letter!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 11.ogg Lynette: You have destroyed this work of art... Step down from the leading role at once... ...Based on the tone, I'd say "threat letter" is right.
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (This is far more serious than a momentary stink-eye... We need to get to the bottom of it.)
 (Examine the letter to see if there is anything amiss...)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (The unsealed envelope contained the group photo, the threat letter — and some photographs of Lynette from during the show. This was definitely meant for her.)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (The letter demands that Lynette step down from the leading role, but stops short of saying what will happen if she doesn't...)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Neither of us recognize the handwriting. It's messy — perhaps to cover their tracks? Or maybe this person just has messy handwriting...)
(Return to option selection)
 (Think back to what was happening on the first floor while we were taking some time out...)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (...There were a lot of people downstairs at the time. Any one of them could have slipped the letter into the envelope.)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (All the envelopes were left on a table on the first floor, but nobody was tasked with watching them. I could ask reception, but it's unlikely they saw anything.)
(Return to option selection)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 12.ogg Lynette: I don't think we're gonna find any more clues here...
 Shall we ask Merieux what he makes of "You have destroyed this work of art"?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: Yes, let's. Whatever "destroyed" means, it could have something to do with the original script that Furina mentioned... Also, I'm gonna have to ask you to stick around a while longer.

Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 maloney 01.ogg ???: Ahh, I can't believe how well the whole "Lynette's debut acting role" thing worked out. Even the avant-garde box office is lapping it up!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 01.ogg Merieux: ...Haha, how could I ever have doubted you? If you hadn't stuck to your guns and kept sending those invitations, this opportunity would've passed us by.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 maloney 02.ogg Maloney: See, I told you! All the times she'd refused in the past were all the more reason to keep inviting her, because it turns into a big talking point!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 maloney 03.ogg Maloney: Can you imagine if you'd gone with Gillian? You'd have been lucky to get half the ticket sales you've ended up with...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 02.ogg Merieux: True... Well, Gillian still needs to get a few more productions under her belt...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: ...Do you have a moment, Director Merieux?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 03.ogg Merieux: ...Oh!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 maloney 04.ogg Maloney: Ah, if it isn't the star of the show! We were just talking about you! ...Hmm? And is that the legendary Traveler with you?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 maloney 05.ogg Maloney: I'm guessing you're here to discuss the show with the director? Hehe... You're a talented and hard-working actress, Lynette — It's no wonder you're getting such rave reviews!
(If Passive Check succeeds)

(Insight Check Success) This gentleman's expression seems a bit unnatural...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Despite his effusive words, the look in his eyes suggests he's not quite so delighted with Lynette's new-found stardom.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 maloney 06.ogg Maloney: ...I'll leave you artists to discuss your work in peace. Merieux, make sure you give your star performer and her friend your full attention!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 04.ogg Merieux: I certainly will! Lynette carries the fortunes of our entire troupe on her shoulders!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: ...
 Who was that?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: Mr. Maloney. An investor or something, I think. I've never asked him.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 05.ogg Merieux: Hehe... So, what can I do for the two of you? I'm afraid I'll have to dash soon as I'm meeting some friends from the newspaper, otherwise I'd love to stay longer.
 We won't take up too much of your time.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: ...We heard that the original script for The Lost Puppet was quite different from the final show. I'm kind of curious to know what the protagonist was like in that version...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 06.ogg Merieux: Oh... Well, this is a surprise. I didn't think you'd be interested in that sort of thing.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 07.ogg Merieux: It's not uncommon for scripts to undergo major changes as they're being brought to the stage. But... I'm afraid there's not much to tell you in this case. The protagonist has stayed the same from beginning to end.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 08.ogg Merieux: A mechanical puppet with a bumbling body but a sensitive soul... "A stranger in time who doesn't belong..."
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 09.ogg Merieux: There's no doubt about it. You are the protagonist, and the protagonist is you! The success of one is the success of the other, and that's what made this show an artistic triumph!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: Sorry, you've lost me. Can you put it in plain words?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 10.ogg Merieux: ...Ahem, alright then. Delving deep in the search of core truths is the job of an artist, after all...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 11.ogg Merieux: You shouldn't give your attention to early drafts of the script, Lynette. All it would do is sow confusion where you already have clarity.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 12.ogg Merieux: The current script is the final version because it is the best version, and your performance best brings that script to life. Why, if it weren't for you, I doubt any audience would give our show the time of day!
 If everyone is happy with Lynette's performance...
 Then how do you explain this letter?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 13.ogg Merieux: What letter? ...Oh, my goodness!
Lynette's Envelope...You heartless puppet!You've ruined this work.Hand over the role of lead actress immediately!...
(If Passive Check succeeds)

(Insight Check Success) Merieux appears surprised...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Merieux's expression is hard to read... but the surprise seems genuine.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 14.ogg Merieux: ..."Destroyed this work of art"? ...Really?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: Well, Director Merieux? Any idea who might have written it?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 15.ogg Merieux: ...No. Who on earth would write such nonsense?
 We found it in the envelope containing the group photo.
 Could it be someone involved in the production?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 16.ogg Merieux: Absolutely not! Without Lynette, this show would be over! Everyone's hard work would go to waste... No, there's no way that this is someone from the troupe!
 Well... Is there any way Lynette could lie low until this blows over?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: Yeah, maybe Gillian could fill in for me for a while...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 17.ogg Merieux: What...? No way! Out of the question! The protagonist has to be played by Lynette. Gillian can't... she's just not what the audience is looking for...
(If Passive Check succeeds)

(Insight Check Success) Merieux's attitude suddenly changed, and became a bit strange...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Merieux's eyes are darting around, and he's lowering his voice...)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 18.ogg Merieux: Ah, I've got it — it's a competitor! Yes, this letter must be from a competitor of ours who's trying to get under Lynette's skin!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 19.ogg Merieux: You can't lie low, that's just what they want you to do! The moment you step back from performing, they'll put their rumor mill into overdrive and drag us through the mud! They're just waiting for the chance to kick us while we're down!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: A competitor? ...Really?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 20.ogg Merieux: Definitely. Those lowlifes... Slander and libel are all their specialties. They drown out the truth with a flood of misinformation, and they stop at nothing once they get riled up!
 You sound very familiar with their methods.
 Do you have a particular suspect in mind?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 21.ogg Merieux: ...There's so many of them out there. Fame always seems to attract haters, no matter what you do to try and keep everyone happy. But don't worry! I will get to the bottom of this!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 22.ogg Merieux: Stay strong, Lynette, and keep up the good work on stage. I have to go and meet my friends from the newspapers now, but rest assured I'll be discussing countermeasures with them!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: So, a competitor, huh...
 Do you think that's it?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: ...I kinda doubt it. We've dealt with those types before. Usually their goal is to steal our venue for their own show, or to cover up a scandal by planting a story to divert public attention.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 11.ogg Lynette: But at the moment... I don't think anyone's got a reason to do any of that stuff. Let alone pull a stunt like this — a threat letter is quite extreme.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 12.ogg Lynette: Besides, when I felt that evil stare, I'm pretty sure it was coming from somewhere backstage... so that rules out a lot of people.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: I'm actually more concerned about Merieux... When I mentioned Gillian, his reaction was pretty unusual.
 So you noticed that too.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 14.ogg Lynette: Especially since Maloney mentioned that the initial plan was to cast Gillian as the lead...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 15.ogg Lynette: Sounds like there was an "original protagonist" as well as an "original script"... I should probably go talk to her.
 Do you know where she lives?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 16.ogg Lynette: Yep. She told me she lives in the Fleuve Cendre.

 Step DescriptionWhat does the sudden appearance of the threat letters and the hidden hostility mean?
(Approach Ginna)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 ginna 01.ogg ???: L—Lynette! ...What are you doing? You're not welcome here!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: ...I've been to the Fleuve Cendre plenty of times before. This is the first I'm hearing about me not being welcome.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 ginna 02.ogg ???: Things are different around here. You might be used to a crowd of bootlicking morons fawning over you wherever you go, but not down here! We... We know what you are!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: Bootlicking morons...?
 She's got a bone to pick with you, I guess?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: I don't know. I've never met this kid before.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 01.ogg Gillian: ...Ginna! Stop that! Go home, now!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 ginna 03.ogg Ginna: B—But... Gillian...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 02.ogg Gillian: No buts! How many times do I have to tell you? That had nothing to do with Lynette!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 03.ogg Gillian: If you don't leave right now, I swear, I'll... I'll... I'll never invite you to one of my shows ever again!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 ginna 04.ogg Ginna: Gillian... I, I...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 ginna 05.ogg Ginna: Hmph! ...Just because Lady Furina speaks highly of you, it doesn't mean you're all that!
After a few more choice words from Ginna, she storms off...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 04.ogg Gillian: I'm so sorry... Ginna's always been a strong-willed child. That's why I never let her visit me at work...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: It's okay. I have younger siblings too, so I get it... She's in her rebellious phase, huh?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: If you let angsty kids get you riled up, they'll drain all your energy. So don't worry, I won't let it get to me.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 05.ogg Gillian: Huh... Well, the situation's a little different in this case, but still — thank you. So... what brings you to the Fleuve Cendre?
 We came to see you.
 Can we talk about the original protagonist?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: We heard about it from Maloney. He said you were originally supposed to play the lead.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 06.ogg Gillian: Maloney, huh... *sigh* Of course he couldn't keep his mouth shut.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 07.ogg Gillian: ...I'm sorry. I never mentioned it because Director Merieux was very clear that I mustn't let any of it affect you.
 Circumstances have changed.
 Lynette received this letter...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 08.ogg Gillian: What's this? ...Aah!
Lynette's Envelope...You heartless puppet!You've ruined this work.Hand over the role of lead actress immediately!...
(If Passive Check succeeds)

(Insight Check Success) Gillian appears surprised...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (On Gillian's face, there's panic... and doubt.)
 The sender thinks that Lynette has destroyed the show...
 Could it have anything to do with the original script and protagonist?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 09.ogg Gillian: I... I don't know, uh... Who would do something like this...?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: Don't be scared, Gillian. Just tell us what you know.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 10.ogg Gillian: ...Okay. I'll... try...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 11.ogg Gillian: It's true... I was originally cast as the lead in The Lost Puppet.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 12.ogg Gillian: ...I've worked with Director Merieux many times before, but only in minor roles. The audiences and critics never had much to say about me — nothing terrible, but nothing amazing either.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 13.ogg Gillian: A few months ago, Merieux starting [sic] working on a new show, so I plucked up the courage to ask him if I could take the leading role.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 14.ogg Gillian: He was hesitant, but he agreed to let me try for the part. We did a few rehearsals, everything seemed to be going okay, but then...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 merieux 01.ogg Merieux: There's... been a change of plan, Gillian. The leading role will now be played by Lynette.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 15.ogg Gillian: Lynette!? But... She always turns these things down, doesn't she?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 merieux 02.ogg Merieux: And that's why we cannot afford to waste this opportunity!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 merieux 03.ogg Merieux: Gillian, I understand how you must be feeling. But Maloney and myself have to do what's best for the production as a whole...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 merieux 04.ogg Merieux: ...Next time, the lead will be yours. I promise.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 16.ogg Gillian: ...I was incredibly disappointed at first. But I also know full well that I don't have Lynette's star power.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 17.ogg Gillian: Without Lynette, how could we ever convince people to pay money to go and see a "masked mime show"?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 18.ogg Gillian: And if the show was a flop with me in the leading role, how would I answer to the director and the rest of the cast?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 19.ogg Gillian: Then, I got to meet you on stage, and found that you're really down to earth, in a way that not many celebrities are. You were kind to everyone, and your performance wasn't bad...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 20.ogg Gillian: ...Whatever disappointment I had left at that point, I certainly wasn't about to take out on you.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: By "wasn't bad"... You mean it wasn't great either. So I'm guessing Merieux changed the script to simplify the protagonist... Make her a dumbed-down version of the mechanical puppet that I could actually play.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 21.ogg Gillian: ...He did make some changes to the script, yes.
 How do we get our hands on the original draft? Who currently has it?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 gillian 22.ogg Gillian: ...Jaiques, one of the other actors. He likes to collect Director Merieux's old drafts because he hopes to be a director himself one day. He also lives nearby... I can arrange for you to meet him at the tavern.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918205 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: Makes sense. I always see him talking to Merieux... Alright, see you at the tavern then.

(Go to the tavern)
After waiting at the tavern for a while...

Media:vo lntcop001 1918206 jacques 01.ogg Jaiques: Gillian brought me up to speed on the situation. I'm here to help however I can! Here, this is the script you're after.
 ...It's very rough. Looks like he was constantly editing it.
 It's practically unreadable.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918206 jacques 02.ogg Jaiques: That's always the way with pen-and-paper drafts. Even the final script is full of last-minute changes by the director.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918206 jacques 03.ogg Jaiques: There should be a cleaner copy of the original script in here somewhere... Ugh, sorry, it's all a bit mixed up. I just grabbed the whole stack of papers since I was in a rush.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918206 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: No problem. Now activating search mode. I'll go through one page at a time.
(Talk to Gillian and Jaiques again, optional)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918206 jacques 04.ogg Jaiques: I wonder what got into Director Merieux...

Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: ...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: ...Yep, that's not something a novice could hope to pull off after just a few months of rehearsals.
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (The basic plot is the same — she loses the ability to dance due to wear-and-tear in her circuitry. But there's much more emotion behind the scene... the memory of her former companions, coming to peace with her life...)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (The simple set and solo performance means the lead actress has to carry the whole scene herself. It's a much more demanding role than in the final script.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: ...Frankly, I think that the original script is much better, and the original lead is the best fit.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: Gillian, shall I go tell Merieux to put you back in the leading role?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 01.ogg Gillian: ...!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 jacques 01.ogg Jaiques: ...What? Are you serious? But the next show is at the Opera Epiclese! It's such a huge opportunity...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: ...But not such a rare one for me though, right?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 jacques 02.ogg Jaiques: That's different! This isn't you as part of a magic duo, it's a chance to star as the main character in a show! You'll reach whole new heights of fame!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: Umm... Fame in small doses has its perks, but... too much, and I'll get overloaded.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: But if you play the lead, the fame will be yours, and I get to be free... Sounds like a win-win, don't you think?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 02.ogg Gillian: ...It'll never work. There's no way Director Merieux or Maloney would ever agree to it.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 03.ogg Gillian: The set for act four would need to change, as would all the marketing materials... and that would mean asking Maloney for a lot more Mora.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 04.ogg Gillian: Changing actors at the last minute is just too risky. If anything went wrong, it could bankrupt the whole troupe!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 05.ogg Gillian: Plus, Maloney's "friends" have already published a ton of articles saying how this is the role that Lynette was born to play... No one else can play the protagonist now.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 06.ogg Gillian: If Lynette quit the show and I took her place...
 ...It would destroy the reputations of Maloney's "friends."
 ...None of their future articles would have any credibility.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 07.ogg Gillian: ...If Lynette left, they'd sooner stop the whole show then let me take her place.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 jacques 03.ogg Jaiques: Stop the whole show!? But... All the people in the troupe... months and months of everyone's hard work would all be for nothing!
 No wonder Merieux will say anything to try and keep Lynette on board.

 All we need to do is this:
You explain your idea to the group...

Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 jacques 04.ogg Jaiques: Y'know, it's a little crazy, but it might actually work...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 08.ogg Gillian: No way! It's not worth taking such a huge risk just for a chance to be in the spotlight.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: Gillian, you said before: "Whatever disappointment I had left... I wasn't about to take out on you."
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 14.ogg Lynette: ...In other words, that disappointment is still there, but you've kept it bottled up inside.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 15.ogg Lynette: Be honest. You still hope to play the leading role, don't you?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 09.ogg Gillian: I... But the thought of putting so many people out just for my sake...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 16.ogg Lynette: You think they'd be put out? Hmm, that's not how I see it...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 jacques 05.ogg Jaiques: ...Gillian, you were more dedicated than anyone during the rehearsals for the original script. We all saw how hard you worked for this role!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 jacques 06.ogg Jaiques: And I think you know that unless we decide to make a stand here.... The path we're on is only going to take us further and further from our dreams. All of us.

Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 12.ogg Gillian: Wait, but what about the threat letter? Do you have any idea who sent it?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 18.ogg Lynette: As long as we stick to the plan, I'll give up the lead role... so it won't matter anymore, right?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 13.ogg Gillian: But surely you want to know who it's from? If they're out there and no one's keeping an eye on them... What if they come looking for you?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 19.ogg Lynette: Umm... I doubt they will. It's supposed to be a threat, but they didn't even say what would happen if I don't meet their demands... Plus the handwriting is kinda childish. Doesn't look like a professional intimidator to me.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 20.ogg Lynette: Who knows, maybe it was just a fan of yours having a moment.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 14.ogg Gillian: A fan? ...Of me?

 It was too much for her to take...
 She wrote that letter in a fit of anger.

 Aren't you gonna confront her about it?

 I can imagine...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 34.ogg Lynette: I was in Gillian's position once. Back when Lyney and I were starting out, before we got famous, we just had to take things a day at a time — doing our shows, slowly trying to build up our reputation...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 35.ogg Lynette: So I can understand Ginna's frustration. Still... she could definitely use some pro tips on how to write a threat letter.
 No wonder she's so hostile towards you...
 She must have been the one giving you that evil stare, right?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 36.ogg Lynette: ...No, the way she looks at me is indignant, frustrated, but not malicious. Plus, she didn't even try to hide how she felt.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 37.ogg Lynette: Whoever was giving me that evil stare was backstage. Blending into the crowd at a drinks reception is one thing, but trying to blend in backstage, where everyone's on high alert waiting to be called on stage, would be a lot more difficult.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 38.ogg Lynette: We'll find out who it is before too long. In two days' time, at the next show... I think it will become very clear.

 Step DescriptionYou come up with a plan to get everything back on track...

(Wait until 16:00 — 18:00 two days later)
(Approach Jaiques inside the Opera Epiclese)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918210 jacques 01.ogg Jaiques: Oh, you're here! Lynette and Gillian are busy getting ready, so please come with me.
Shortly after following Jaiques into the opera house, the curtains open and the show begins...
Act I: In the Ruins

Media:vo lntcop001 1918210 mimeaudiencec 01.ogg Audience: ...That puppet in the middle, is that Lynette? She's so pretty...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918210 mimeaudienceb 01.ogg Audience: It's starting, keep your voice down!
The protagonist, a dancer, has been abandoned in some ruins.She suspects it's because of a health condition with her legs, which has affected her ability to dance.But then, she finds the other abandoned puppets who look just like her. Only then does she realize:Her "illness" is just a mechanical breakdown. And she is just a dancing puppet.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918210 mimeaudiencea 01.ogg Audience: Wow... I thought it would be hard to follow, but in the end it was actually very clear.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918210 mimeaudiencec 02.ogg Audience: ...Even though her face was expressionless and she didn't speak the whole time, I felt like I could really understand how the protagonist was feeling!
Act II: The Journey
Some mechanical puppets believe in a myth:At the end of the world, there is a god of puppets who can turn puppets into human beings.And so, the protagonist and her companions begin their quest......But the myth is a lie, spread by someone with nothing but contempt for puppet-kind. At the end of their journey, they are kidnapped, dismantled, melted down, and abused.The protagonist helped her companions escape, but in the process became trapped under the rubble of a crumbling building. She closes her eyes and enters into a deep sleep...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918210 mimeaudiencea 02.ogg Audience: Director Merieux really is a master of his craft... and so is the actress in the lead role...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918210 mimeaudienceb 02.ogg Audience: I have a friend who saw the show on the opening day — they thought the critics overstated how good it was. But I gotta say, the protagonist is incredible!
Act II closes to thunderous applause from the crowd...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918210 amaury 01.ogg Amaury: I can't believe it's only been a few days since the last show. Lynette's improved so much! Just wow. I'm speechless! Words simply cannot do justice to the sheer excellence we witnessed from Lynette on stage today.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918210 corentin 01.ogg Corentin: Your penchant for the hyperbolic strikes again, Amaury... Clearly, you weren't at a loss for words when you were writing your article — I saw you hand it to the journalist. Trying to get your critique into the papers the moment the show is over, are you?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918210 amaury 02.ogg Amaury: Haha, well, you know how it is — the early critics get all the readers! Wouldn't you agree, Merieux?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918210 merieux 01.ogg Merieux: ...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918210 maloney 01.ogg Maloney: ...Hmm? What's the matter, cat got your tongue? The first half was a huge success — even I could tell the acting was top-tier...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918210 merieux 02.ogg Merieux: ...My apologies, Mr. Maloney, please excuse me for a second... I need to have a little talk with my actors.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918210 maloney 02.ogg Maloney: Oh, uh... very well! Hey, while you're at it, this might be a good time to talk future collaborations with Lynette! Hehe...

Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 jacques 01.ogg Jaiques: We're already halfway there, we can't back out now! All we need to do is stick to the plan...

Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 02.ogg Merieux: Corentin and Amaury have both finished their articles. I went to greet them as a mere formality... But you seem to have availed yourselves of my absence during the first half to defy me. What have you done?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 03.ogg Merieux: Was that really Lynette playing the lead role?
 Well done, Director. You saw through it.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: Tada.

Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: I switched costumes and masks with Gillian so that I could be the protagonist's companion... and stay out of the limelight.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 04.ogg Merieux: Lynette... Why on earth would you do this!?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: You know my acting is amateur. The only reason I'm being seen as a pro, let alone a pioneer, is because you have critics reporting the show.
 But right now, there's a whole audience out there...
 And you have no hope of paying them all off.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: If they'd seen me in the leading role during the first half, they wouldn't be expecting anything more... But what happens now that they've seen Gillian in the role?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: If you force me to play the lead in the second half, they'll be wondering: Why is the actress suddenly giving such an underwhelming performance, right at the climax of the whole story?
 Is it because she's not a good enough actress to play the role?
 Or is this director not all he's cracked up to be?
 Were the critics wrong?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: These are just some of the questions that will be on everyone's minds during the second half. And those questions will follow them out the doors of the theater after the show ends.
 Do you think the critics will still have any credibility then?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: There's only one way for you to save your reputation. And that's to keep Gillian as the lead all the way to the end.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 05.ogg Merieux: Absolutely not! I'd sooner announce that we're having technical difficulties and need to stop the show!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 06.ogg Merieux: If I keep Gillian as the lead for the second half, what do you think will happen in the curtain call, when she takes her mask off? Everyone will see that we've changed actors!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 07.ogg Merieux: What will your fans think? They're only here because of you! And what about all the critics who support you? If we get on the wrong side of them, it'll be the death of the whole show!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 08.ogg Merieux: There'd be tickets to refund, fines to pay for breach of contract... The whole troupe's hard work would go down the drain! Don't you see how much this would cost us?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 09.ogg Merieux: ...You can't just take a job on a whim, then abandon your responsibility the moment you don't feel like doing it anymore! You're playing games with other people's hopes and dreams!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 gillian 02.ogg Gillian: Director Merieux, please! You're not being fair to Lynette...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: Actually, Gillian, he's half right. I did kind of take this on a whim.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: But my responsibility here is making sure you get back the role that belongs to you.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 01.ogg Lyney: Heh, and I guess part of that responsibility lies with me, considering I badgered you into accepting the job?
 Look who finally decided to show up.
 Did you bring all your props?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 02.ogg Lyney: Haha, sorry I'm a little late to the show. Work's been keeping me pretty busy lately.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 10.ogg Merieux: Lyney...? Ugh, what do you want? Do you think you can snap your fingers and make all my problems magically disappear?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 03.ogg Lyney: That might be a little tricky... But instead, I could make something else magically appear.

Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 11.ogg Merieux: ...What's this?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: A draft complaint letter, my contract, your legal fees, reimbursement for the tickets, and an advance on the penalty fee for breach of contract.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 11.ogg Lynette: Mr. Merieux... I'm stepping down from the leading role. Regardless of whether you choose to cancel the rest of today's show.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 04.ogg Lyney: If you do suffer unforeseen financial losses from this, you're free to seek damages as per the contract. And if you want to file a lawsuit, there's a draft here that you can use if you need it.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 12.ogg Merieux: What the... Hah... I can't believe this. You're literally handing me a lawsuit against you, with a straight face?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 13.ogg Merieux: Of course... All this Mora, it's a pittance to you, isn't it? Hmph, must be nice to have the luxury of prior success and fame!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 14.ogg Merieux: Look at us, we're huge stars! One minute we wanna go on stage, the next we feel like backing out of the contract. But that's okay, we're famous, we can afford it! You have no respect for other people's work! You're treating other people's hopes and dreams like a big joke!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 15.ogg Merieux: ...You don't give a hoot how much this show means to other people. You don't even care that the whole production might have to shut down because of you!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 12.ogg Lynette: ...That's not true. I do care. And I'm under no illusion as to how much this show means to you.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 16.ogg Merieux: ...Oh, brilliant deduction there. Of course it means a lot to me, this is my show! That's the only reason I asked you to be in it in the first place!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: Really? Then why do your eyes tell a different story? The way you look at me... it's full of contempt.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 14.ogg Lynette: Almost as if... I've destroyed your work of art.
 (Ah... so it was Merieux.)
 (He's the one who was looking at Lynette with contempt.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 17.ogg Merieux: What? I... I would never think that!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 05.ogg Lyney: A couple days ago, I asked some associates to do some digging for me. I was interested to know who else you invited to play the lead apart from Lynette...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 06.ogg Lyney: Surprise, surprise — turns out that all the other famous actresses you asked either had prior commitments or weren't a good fit for the role... they all turned you down.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 15.ogg Lynette: ...And I would have turned you down too, if not for an unlikely set of coincidences.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 07.ogg Lyney: You didn't send those invitations because you were looking for a better actress than Gillian... but because your investor wanted a big name in your show. Right?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 gillian 03.ogg Gillian: Director Merieux...
 It's clear as day that Gillian is an outstanding actress.
 But fame was the key factor, and that was the one thing she didn't have.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 16.ogg Lynette: To get Maloney on your side, you chose to make Gillian the understudy and then look for an opportunity for her to take the lead.
 But then... Lynette actually accepted your invitation.
 And her acting debut was sure to attract attention.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 08.ogg Lyney: I bet you were torn at first, weren't you? Do you stick to the tried-and-tested formula? Choose Lynette, use her celebrity to get the critics on your side so that you and your investors can line your pockets?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 17.ogg Lynette: Or... do you choose Gillian, so that you and your long-time collaborator can stage the show of your dreams: the original, unedited version of The Lost Puppet?
 Whether you did it because of pressure from your investors...
 Ultimately, you betrayed yourself by choosing Lynette.
 Or because you were lured in by the money...
 Ultimately, you betrayed yourself by choosing Lynette.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 18.ogg Merieux: Agh...! I—I didn't... I didn't betray myself...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 18.ogg Lynette: You mentioned "prior success and fame" earlier... But you're a well-known director yourself, with countless works to your name. Wouldn't that make you successful too?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 19.ogg Lynette: Or maybe, deep down... none of your current achievements really count as "success" to you.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 19.ogg Merieux: Argh...!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 09.ogg Lyney: Right now, you have an opportunity to send Gillian onto that stage and perform the second half as you always imagined it, faithful to your original script.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 10.ogg Lyney: Your work would be displayed for all of Fontaine to see, in its true, perfect form.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 20.ogg Merieux: Did... did you say... perfect...?
 Will you keep pursuing a kind of "success" that you don't even value...
 ...At the cost of your own artistic integrity?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 20.ogg Lynette: Or... will you act now, before Maloney and the critics can protest, and make your dream come true on the stage? And Gillian's dream... in fact, the dreams of the whole troupe.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 21.ogg Merieux: ...The whole troupe?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 gillian 04.ogg Gillian: Director Merieux... Actually, most of the money Lyney brought came from us. We all chipped in.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 cyril 03.ogg Cyril: We've worked with you for many years now. Your troupe has been here for you all the way, from the empty theaters where we first performed to the opera house today.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 jacques 02.ogg Jaiques: We watched as you slowly started down a path you used to despise... the path of powerful connections, drinks receptions, backdoor deals with the critics, and collaborations based on fame instead of talent.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 22.ogg Merieux: But... But this is just a temporary measure! I did it for the good of the troupe! And... and besides, this is how the whole industry works! Everyone else is doing it!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 cyril 04.ogg Cyril: Yes, we know. Back when you started, you had to bite the bullet and do these things to keep the troupe afloat.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 cyril 05.ogg Cyril: But then what happened? You began to embrace these methods more and more, becoming so reliant on them that every show you put out is over-hyped by the media, and every script you write is edited to suit some celebrity's needs.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 jacques 03.ogg Jaiques: Surely you must have noticed what's happening? While we've been performing at bigger and bigger theaters with each show, the applause is getting quieter and quieter each night, and the criticism from people who've seen the show is growing.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 jacques 04.ogg Jaiques: Maloney's "friends" are sycophants. They don't care if the audience is disappointed because the show doesn't live up to their glowing reviews. They praise the things they like, and skirt around the things they don't!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 gillian 05.ogg Gillian: Look, I know everyone's using the same promotional tactics, but... does that really make it okay?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 23.ogg Merieux: Well, it's... it's just a stop-gap solution. I... as soon as I've made enough Mora, I'll stop. Things will be different next time, I promise...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 21.ogg Lynette: Next time, huh? Yeah, next time you won't use your connections, next time you won't pay off your critics. Next time, you'll let Gillian play the lead...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 11.ogg Lyney: Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that. If you make some money once, you'll want to do it again, then again... Slowly but surely, you turn your back on your dreams.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 gillian 06.ogg Gillian: ...I won't turn my back on my dreams any longer, Director Merieux! Never again!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 together 01.ogg Jaiques & Cyril: Me neither!
 [Persuasion] Today is the day! It's time to live your dreams!

Media:vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 24.ogg Merieux: I... had dreams too, once...

Act III: Amidst the Rubble
...An unknown period of time elapsed before a group of mechanical puppets finally cleared the rubble, freed the protagonist, and reactivated her.They told her: "You have been buried here for thousands of years. The mechanical puppets now rule the world."It turned out that the puppets who had started the uprising were none other than the protagonist's companions, whom she had rescued all those years ago. The protagonist was now revered as a hero by all of puppet-kind.The mechanical puppets ask the protagonist what she wishes for, but she only wishes for one thing...

Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 mimeaudiencea 01.ogg Audience: ...Huh? The plot here seems a little different from what the reviews said...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 mimeaudienceb 01.ogg Audience: The protagonist wanted to return to the stage, so the puppets replaced all her parts with the latest ones available, built her a grand opera house, and summoned a huge audience...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 mimeaudiencea 02.ogg Audience: ...And in the end, she forgot herself amidst the applause and cheers of her fellow puppets...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 mimeaudiencec 01.ogg Audience: Hey! No spoilers! Huh? Wait... Hang on, that's not even what's happening... The set has changed back to the one from the first act...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 01.ogg Merieux: Oh, archons... Please let this work out...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lyney 01.ogg Lyney: No need to be so nervous, Director Merieux. We only told you Lynette would be quitting the show to get you to make a decision... We wanted you to believe that this show would have to end after today, no matter what you decided.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lyney 02.ogg Lyney: But in truth, I believe that if we choose our words carefully, there's no reason we can't talk Maloney around and keep the show going.
 Lyney is putting his experience at fooling people to work...
 You two should definitely keep in touch.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 02.ogg Merieux: You really thought this plan through... Hmph... But I'm not upset about what you've done.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 03.ogg Merieux: ...What's worrying me now isn't how Maloney will react, or whether the show will get canceled.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 04.ogg Merieux: It's... the audience. I've always thought the original script is better, but will it move them like I've always hoped? When Gillian does her curtain call, will they applaud her?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 05.ogg Merieux: What if people only came to see the show for Lynette, and because of the reviews? What if they don't really care about the show at all?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 06.ogg Merieux: ...It feels like I've been hiding inside my safe little castle for too long, and now I'm scared to go outside the walls and hear what people really think...
 ...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lyney 03.ogg Lyney: ...We're right her with you. We'll watch it to the end.
Act IV: Amidst the Ruins(Original Script)
The protagonist rejects the other puppets' offer of new parts and a grand stage built in her honor...Her only wish is to see her companions again... but she is told that they gave their lives for the revolution.Their bodies lie buried in the ruins where they first met.The protagonist returns to the ruins alone, to where her journey first began.She performs one last dance before the graves of her companions. Her circuitry burns out, her parts come loose and fall from her body, but she keeps dancing until her body completely shuts down....It has taken her thousands of years, but at last, she has finally found a reason for dancing.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 mimeaudiencea 03.ogg Audience: Wow... Okay, this ending is much better!

Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 mimeaudiencec 02.ogg Audience: I love how they brought back the set from act one and gave it a whole new meaning... What a fantastic twist!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 gillian 01.ogg Gillian: (Time for the curtain call... It's the moment of truth. Will the applause continue after I take off the mask?)

Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 gillian 02.ogg Gillian: (...I could always leave my mask on... No one would ever know.)
(While the audience cheers, some in the crowd are visibly confused. From the balcony, Furina lends her applause, before the remaining audience applauds as well.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: (...This is what fame looks like when it's truly deserved.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 07.ogg Merieux: Hah...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 08.ogg Merieux: Ha... Haha...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 jacques 01.ogg Jaiques: ...Gillian, you were AMAZING! Cyril was tearing up when you did your final solo dance!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 cyril 01.ogg Cyril: Uh... Well, so were you...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 gillian 03.ogg Gillian: Really? I was so nervous, my legs felt like they'd turned to jelly...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: What looked like an actor unsteady on her feet was in fact a poignant expression of the protagonist's frailty in her last moments... or whatever.
 Oh no, I can't take any more of that...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 09.ogg Merieux: ...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 corentin 01.ogg Corentin: ...Hey! Merieux! What's [sic] the heck was that? Why wasn't Lynette playing the lead?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 amaury 01.ogg Amaury: Our articles are already going to press! You better have a good explanation for this!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 gillian 04.ogg Gillian: Um... It was my—
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 jacques 02.ogg Jaiques: Hey now, it was all of our—
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 10.ogg Merieux: Hold on.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 11.ogg Merieux: ...The decision was mine, and mine alone. They had nothing to do with it. If you have any concerns, gentlemen, then please direct them to me.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 maloney 01.ogg Maloney: Merieux...! So it was you! Well then... I trust you'll have no objection to me pulling the plug on this production?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 12.ogg Merieux: ...I—I... *sigh*
 (His worst fear is coming true...)
 (...Time for act five.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lyney 04.ogg Lyney: ...Director Merieux, Mr. Maloney, what on earth is going on? Why was Lynette not in the lead role?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lyney 05.ogg Lyney: It took a lot of convincing from me for her to accept the role, and I had to turn down some big work opportunities to come and watch her performance today... You have some explaining to do.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 maloney 02.ogg Maloney: Lyney? ...It was all his idea! Merieux, explain yourself!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: Wait...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: Lyney, as a matter of fact... this was a piece of performance art.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: ...In this play, the masks and costumes serve to obscure the differences between characters, and by extension, the difference between human and machine...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: We took that idea to the next level with an actor swap, blurring the lines between one performer and the next. So it's in service of the ambitious artistic goals of the production.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 corentin 02.ogg Corentin: ...Uh, what?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: It's similar to deceiving the audience in a magic show. We employed this technique as a means of breaking the fourth wall.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: It allows the audience to more intuitively understand the cognitive dissonance felt by the protagonist as a machine trying to reconcile the notion of her humanity. The audience's experience mirrors the protagonist's own confusion, and becomes part of the artistic performance itself.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 maloney 03.ogg Maloney: Hold up... What is this nonsense?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lyney 06.ogg Lyney: ...Oh, I see! Well, bravo Director Merieux. You even had me fooled!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: That's probably more because you just don't really understand avant-garde art very well, Lyney.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lyney 07.ogg Lyney: Maybe so, maybe so... Well, perhaps it went over my head, but I'm sure our experts here saw the whole thing coming a mile away!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 amaury 02.ogg Amaury: ...Umm...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: You must have worked it out by the end of the first half, surely? Mr. Amaury, I just heard that you managed to write your review after just the first two acts...
 I'm sure that will help Director Merieux by setting future audiences up for the surprise twist at the end.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 amaury 03.ogg Amaury: Ahem! Y—Yes, you're right. Director Merieux and I are old friends... You should have said something, then I could have played along even better...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 13.ogg Merieux: Ahem, yes, well... To deceive the audience, you must first deceive your closest companions... I have to give credit to Lynette and her experience in performing magic — that's what inspired me to take my art to the next level...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lyney 08.ogg Lyney: Hmm? You mean your show was partly inspired by Lynette's background in magic? Well, in that case, I'll have to plug it to everyone I know!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 11.ogg Lynette: ...Unfortunately, I think Mr. Maloney is going to cancel the show.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lyney 09.ogg Lyney: Cancel the show? Mr. Maloney, is this true!?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 maloney 04.ogg Maloney: Uhh... While I accept that deceiving the audience in the manner you did certainly has artistic merit... This is not a magic show, and we don't want our audience demanding their money back...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 12.ogg Lynette: ...A very valid criticism, and one that I humbly accept. If that happens, we're prepared to reimburse and apologize to any audience members who weren't satisfied with the experience.
 But based on their reaction today, I think that what most people want to see...
 ...Is an excellent piece of theater, and not celebrity cameos.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: Plus, it looks like Gillian is better than me at delivering the excellence people want to see. I'm sure audiences will be very happy with the show if she's allowed to stay in the leading role.
 Some reviews have said that Lynette gave the performance of the year...
 Wouldn't you say Gillian's was the performance of a lifetime?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 corentin 03.ogg Corentin: Maloney, uh... I believe there should still be time to tweak my article? From the look on Lynette's face... I think she's being sincere...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 14.ogg Lynette: Oh, one other thing... We managed to get a meeting with Lady Furina earlier — all thanks to (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)'s reputation, of course.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 15.ogg Lynette: Anyway, she agreed to write a review focusing on Gillian's performance and the quality of the show as a whole... She promised to give her honest opinion.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 16.ogg Lynette: ...And I'm sure today's audience will be discussing her performance too. There's sure to be a variety of opinions.
 But what about you, Mr. Corentin?
 How would you rate this show?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 corentin 04.ogg Corentin: Oh... I mean... art at its finest, clearly! Um, but I'll have to give it some thought before I decide exactly what to write...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 17.ogg Lynette: Oh, of course. Always good to put some thought into these things. Especially now, with a growing range of voices out there... I imagine competition for readers becomes more fierce when everyone's discussing the topic?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 maloney 05.ogg Maloney: Tsk... Corentin! Amaury! Let's go!
A sour-faced Maloney leaves with the critics in tow...You and Lyney excuse yourselves and leave, and the actors excitedly look forward to their next show...

That's All, Folks[]

(Talk to Jaiques and Cyril, optional)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918212 jacques 03.ogg Jaiques: ...Do you think this move needs jazzing up a little?

Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 02.ogg Merieux: I always told myself that once I'd made enough Mora, I'd get back to doing what I loved... But somewhere along the way, I started to lose sight of what that was.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 03.ogg Merieux: Huh... Just like those critics with their dishonest reviews, I became all about the trappings of success, at the expense of the art itself.
 At least you came to your senses just in time.
 And you've got an amazing group of talented people behind you.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 04.ogg Merieux: ...You're right. Yes, I'm a very lucky man.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 05.ogg Merieux: ...Anyway, enough about my problems — what are we going to do about the threat letter that Lynette received?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 06.ogg Merieux: I've been looking into it a lot over the past couple of days, but it doesn't seem like it was one of our competitors after all...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: Ah yes, about that...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 01.ogg Ginna: Um... Lynette, do you... have a moment?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 07.ogg Merieux: Hmm? Wait, you're... Gillian's sister, right?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 gillian 01.ogg Gillian: I'm sorry, Ginna insisted on coming to see Lynette, I couldn't stop her...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 02.ogg Ginna: Lynette... I'm sorry!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: Ah...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Lynette just shot me a glance... I think she's unsure which "mode" to use in this situation...)
 (Wait and see how things play out.) (This dialogue option leads to Break.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 05.ogg Ginna: That letter... I was the one who wrote it.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 11.ogg Merieux: ...What!?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 gillian 03.ogg Gillian: Ginna... So it was YOU!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 jacques 05.ogg Jaiques: Director! It's time for... Ooh, okay, weird energy here...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 cyril 03.ogg Cyril: I think we came at a bad time...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 gillian 04.ogg Gillian: Lynette, I... Ginna must have been worried sick about me, I'm sure even she wouldn't do something so stupid if she was in her right mind... Oh, I'm so sorry! I promise I'll make it up to you somehow!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 06.ogg Ginna: ...Gillian, no! This is completely my fault, and I'm the one who should have to bear the consequences! I got the wrong end of the stick, and completely misjudged Lynette...
 Shall we hear what Lynette has to say?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: Well... Since I haven't actually suffered any losses, seeking redress could be difficult...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 11.ogg Lynette: Maybe we could just... let this one slide?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 gillian 05.ogg Gillian: Really? ...Are you sure?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 12.ogg Lynette: After all, Ginna wouldn't be the first person to ever misjudge me... Right?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 12.ogg Merieux: Uhh... True, true...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: In any case, I think we can all agree it was a misunderstanding and nothing more. No need to overcomplicate things.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 07.ogg Ginna: But still... I was wrong to write that letter. I should own up to my actions — make it up to you in some way...
 She seems pretty insistent...
 Kids at this age really are stubborn...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 14.ogg Lynette: Hmm... If that's what you really want, then how about helping out backstage?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 08.ogg Ginna: Huh? Backstage...?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 15.ogg Lynette: The crew could always use an extra hand. Plus... it'll give your older sister a chance to keep an eye on you. And stop you getting into any more trouble.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 gillian 06.ogg Gillian: ...Thank you, Lynette... Really. Thank you so much.
(Continues to Break)
 [Performance] What's she talking about? Never heard of it. (This dialogue option leads to Ending: A Roaring Success!.)

Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: ...Yeah, me neither.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 03.ogg Ginna: Wait... but...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: Oh, do you mean when we ran into you at the Fleuve Cendre? And you said some mean things to me?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: As I recall, you were only trying to look out for your sister. It was just a few words spoken in anger. Don't worry, whatever it was you said, I've already forgotten.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 08.ogg Merieux: ...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 09.ogg Merieux: ...Hah. I see.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 10.ogg Merieux: Well, it sounds like Ginna knows what she did was wrong. Owning up to your mistakes and committing to do better in the future is what counts.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: I understand that feeling of wanting to stand up for your family when they're being mistreated. Really, I do.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: ...But next time, maybe consider a different tactic? Something you can pull off more effectively, and without arousing suspicion...
 Alright, that's enough...
 Stop giving her ideas!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 04.ogg Ginna: Got it... Thank you, Lynette.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 gillian 02.ogg Gillian: ...Why do I feel like I'm missing something here?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 jacques 01.ogg Jaiques: Hey, here you are! I was wondering where you'd all run off to.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 cyril 01.ogg Cyril: Great, everyone's in one place. That makes this so much easier.
 What's up?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 jacques 02.ogg Jaiques: Hehe, what do you think? It's group photo time! We have to commemorate the debut of The Lost Puppet: Director's Edition!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 jacques 03.ogg Jaiques: Okay everyone, we all have pretty awkward smiles on our faces in the photo from Hotel Debord. So this time, no forced smiles allowed!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: Ohh... Am I really not allowed to force a smile...
 Is smiling tough for you?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: ...I'll try, I suppose. I think I can manage.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 jacques 04.ogg Jaiques: Lynette, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), come on — you two should be right in the middle...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918213 cyril 02.ogg Cyril: Three, two, one, smile!

Back to Business[]
 Quest DescriptionShinobu, her temper cooling for now, decides to go back to her real plans for the day...

Kuki Shinobu teaches the three a painful lesson...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 mamoru 01.ogg Mamoru: Ouch... Ouch...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: There we go... Whew... *exhale*...
 Now that you've taught them a lesson...
 You can get back to your original plan for today...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Hmph... You got off lightly.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I have more important things to do today. We'll finish this off tomorrow, is that clear?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 genta 01.ogg Genta: Huh? Tomorrow? ...Do we have to?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Excuse me?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 genta 02.ogg Genta: Got it, got it! We'll, we'll, leave you to your other plans!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...Hmph.
Kuki Shinobu leaves...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 mamoru 02.ogg Mamoru: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! Why did you just stand there and watch?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 akira 01.ogg Akira: Don't you care about us at all?
 It was going to happen sooner or later...
 Better to get it out of the way...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 mamoru 03.ogg Mamoru: I guess that's true. And the longer she puts it off, the angrier she gets...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 genta 03.ogg Genta: But she said there'll be more to come tomorrow.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 mamoru 04.ogg Mamoru: Aaah! If only Shinobu was busy tomorrow, too!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 genta 04.ogg Genta: Hmm... Hey, how about we hold her up somehow, so she still has things left to do tomorrow?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 akira 02.ogg Akira: Uhh... that sounds kinda risky. If we end up sabotaging Shinobu's work... even boss wouldn't be able to protect us, would he?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 mamoru 05.ogg Mamoru: Yeah, if Shinobu ever found out it was us... Urgh, I don't even wanna think about it.
 You're not going to do anything awful, are you?
 I'd put a stop to it long before Shinobu ever found out.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 genta 05.ogg Genta: No way, we won't do anything bad! We're just gonna go have a look and, y'know, hold things up if it's possible... Ahem, I mean, we can't just sit here and do nothing, can we?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 genta 06.ogg Genta: If you don't trust us, why don't you come and watch? Uh, y'know, to keep an eye on us!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 akira 03.ogg Akira: Yeah... there's nothing wrong with just taking a look? Who knows, maybe it'll give us some other ideas.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 akira 04.ogg Akira: Also, if (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)'s there... we can probably talk our way out if we get discovered...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 mamoru 06.ogg Mamoru: Um, o—okay then... From what Shinobu was just saying now, she should be heading to the Uyuu Restaurant.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914401 mamoru 07.ogg Mamoru: Let's quietly follow her and just... see how it goes...
(Proceeds to Eavesdroppers)

Eavesdroppers[]

(Go to the second floor of Uyuu Restaurant)
(Upon entering Uyuu Restaurant)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 akira 01.ogg Akira: Looks like they're not on the first floor... Maybe they're upstairs?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 genta 01.ogg Genta: A—Are you sure we should go up there? I—I gotta psych myself up first...
(Talk to Okazaki Erika)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 okazakierika 01.ogg Okazaki Erika: Are they waiting to be served? Uh... somehow, it doesn't look like it...
(Talk to Akira or Genta)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 akira 02.ogg Akira: How about... you head up first?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 genta 02.ogg Genta: Uh... maybe I can watch the exits, keep them clear...
(Talk to Mamoru)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 mamoru 01.ogg Mamoru: We need to be super stealthy when we head up... mustn't make a sound...
(Go upstairs)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 kujousara 01.ogg Kujou Sara: ...This is Miss Kuki Shinobu, whom I've recommended to you before.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Kuki Shinobu, I studied law in Liyue, so while I couldn't claim to be an expert, I do have a rudimentary grasp of the basics.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 norika 01.ogg Norika: Hehe, from what I've heard, Miss Kuki, I'm sure you're being very modest. I'm looking forward to working together.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 kujousara 02.ogg Kujou Sara: I can assure you that she is exceptionally capable. All the Doushin from the Police Station have vouched for her abilities.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 norika 02.ogg Norika: Well, with such a glowing endorsement, I'm almost tempted to ask you if you'd like to start right away, Miss Kuki.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: You flatter me, Madam Norika, but perhaps we can discuss the role in detail over our meal before deciding how well I'm suited to the role.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 norika 03.ogg Norika: Oh! Forgive me for getting ahead of myself. You're quite right, Miss Kuki. Let's continue this discussion as we dine, or the food will get cold.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 kujousara 03.ogg Kujou Sara: Heh, it's quite understandable to be hungry for top talent.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 mamoru 02.ogg Mamoru: Akira, Genta... did you hear that? Is Shinobu... at a job interview? And look who it's with — the Tenryou Commission tengu!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 akira 03.ogg Akira: Never thought I'd see that self-important tengu acting so polite... who's that other woman they're with? Some bigshot official?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 genta 03.ogg Genta: Well, duh! That tengu is the Shogunate's general! So that other lady has gotta be someone ridiculously high-up.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 akira 04.ogg Akira: Well, whoever it is — it looks like Shinobu is gonna take a new job with the Shogunate! You heard 'em, the job's practically hers already!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 genta 04.ogg Genta: But without Shinobu... what's gonna happen to the Arataki Gang...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 mamoru 03.ogg Mamoru: We gotta do something! Quick, let's go tell the boss! He should be looking for Onikabuto nearby...
(Attempt to walk in the room at the second floor)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 genta 05.ogg Genta: Hey! Don't let Shinobu and the tengu see you!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914402 mamoru 04.ogg Mamoru: Come on, let's head back and talk things through with the boss.
(Talk to Arataki Itto)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 mamoru 01.ogg Mamoru: Boss! Bad news, Boss! Really bad!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Hey, hey... What's with the panic vibes, huh? This is the Arataki Gang, remember? It ain't bad news till we show up, am I right! Haha, so come on, what's up?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 akira 01.ogg Akira: It's Shinobu... She, she...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 genta 01.ogg Genta: Shinobu's gonna go work for the tengu!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 02.ogg Arataki Itto: ...What? Shinobu found a new job!? You have got to be kidding me!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 mamoru 02.ogg Mamoru: No, it's true, Boss! We saw her at the interview with our own eyes, didn't we, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 She was interviewing, but...
 Yes, Sara was there, however...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 03.ogg Arataki Itto: Grr! That slimy... I knew that tengu had her greedy eyes on Shinobu!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 04.ogg Arataki Itto: I mean, she's obviously jealous of the Arataki Gang's top-class talent, but now she's trying to poach my people... Gah, that thieving tengu!
 Shouldn't we ask Shinobu about this first?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 akira 02.ogg Akira: But they're already asking her for a start date!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 genta 02.ogg Genta: It's in the bag, the interview is clearly just a formality!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 05.ogg Arataki Itto: Huh... Well, based on my experience of interviewing once every three days, I know for a fact that they will have been plotting this for a long time by now!
 I don't think Shinobu would switch jobs for no reason...
 Could this all just be a misunderstanding?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 06.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh! There is no way she— Well, actually, you know what, you could be right... she gets treated pretty well in the Arataki Gang. I mean, every time we win some snacks, she does get first pick...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 mamoru 03.ogg Mamoru: But I heard that a day's salary in the Shogunate is enough to buy a week's worth of snacks for the whole gang...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 07.ogg Arataki Itto: Yeah, but, still... in the Arataki Gang, we have a more relaxed working environment, don't we? Seriously, have you ever seen that tengu smile? No! She always has that same sour look on her face...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 akira 03.ogg Akira: But we seem to be the only ones who're relaxed, no? Every time we get caught, Shinobu's the one who has to come and get us out.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 genta 03.ogg Genta: Do you think maybe... after we got arrested for posting flyers this time... Shinobu finally had enough?
 If it were me, I'd be looking for a new job.
 Those flyers drive me mad too.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 08.ogg Arataki Itto: Wait, so it's not a misunderstanding then?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 akira 04.ogg Akira: It's all our fault! We made Shinobu angry and now she's found a new job!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 mamoru 04.ogg Mamoru: Boss! What are we gonna do? Without Shinobu... the Arataki Gang won't survive!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 09.ogg Arataki Itto: Alright, you guys. Come with me, we'll go door to door and apologize! And we'll... we'll tear down all the flyers!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 genta 04.ogg Genta: What? But boss, it took you months to make those!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 10.ogg Arataki Itto: Don't you think I know that, I know what it took! But... but we have to show Shinobu we're truly sorry, and this is... it's the only way...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 akira 05.ogg Akira: Boss! *sobs*
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 11.ogg Arataki Itto: Also, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), I need you to do something for me.
 Let's hear it.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 12.ogg Arataki Itto: Go find Shinobu and tell her you want an interview!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 13.ogg Arataki Itto: If you tell Shinobu that you want to join us, suddenly she'll have a whole different outlook on the future of the Arataki Gang!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 14.ogg Arataki Itto: With you and Shinobu as my trusty number two's and, Arataki "Numero Uno" Itto running the show, we'd be unstoppable! The Shogunate would have a tough time competing with us then, huh!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 mamoru 05.ogg Mamoru: Whoa, nice one, Boss!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 genta 05.ogg Genta: The Arataki Gang rules!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 15.ogg Arataki Itto: What do you say, partner?
 Alright, but just this once...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 16.ogg Arataki Itto: Haha, okay, I'll leave Shinobu to you then. Boys, we've got some apologies to make!
(Talk to Arataki Itto again)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 17.ogg Arataki Itto: Man, at second glance... I really outdid myself with the artwork on these flyers! Ugh, now I'm having second thoughts...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914403 itto 18.ogg Arataki Itto: No, no, I said I'm gonna tear them down, and I'm an oni of my word! Let's do this!

Not Quite Your Daily Deeds[]
 Step DescriptionKuki Shinobu decides to take you out to the street to help you further consider joining the Arataki Gang...

(Return to Uyuu Restaurant)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914404 norika 01.ogg Norika: ...Alright then, you can expect us to be in touch very soon to follow up, Miss Kuki.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914404 kujousara 01.ogg Kujou Sara: It's getting late, I should get back. I hope that the next time we meet will be at the headquarters of the Tenryou Commission.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914404 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Thank you, I'm truly honored.
Sara and the others say goodbye to Kuki Shinobu.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914404 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Huh? (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? When did you get here?
 I just arrived...
 I saw nothing!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914404 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Huh...? Whatever. What did you want? Ugh, have Genta and the guys caused a scene again?
 Actually... I came to request an interview with you.
 I'd like to join the Arataki Gang.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914404 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: An interview? You wanna join the Arataki Gang? ...You haven't consumed any strange substances, have you?
 Of course not.
 I'm being serious.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914404 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: So this isn't a joke... huh, that kinda makes this even more concerning.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914404 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: It's not like you don't know the Arataki Gang, so what's gotten into you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? ...Ahem, I mean, what sparked your interest in joining?
 I like the people.
 I like the culture.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914404 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I see... Well, enjoying it from the outside is one thing, but actually being in the gang is a whole different story.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914404 shinobu 08.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I have to go into town to take care of some routine gang business. You can come with me — consider it your internship.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914404 shinobu 09.ogg Kuki Shinobu: After that, if you still want to join us...
 Then I'm in?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914404 shinobu 10.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...We'll see how it goes.
(Talk to the merchants near the street)

Media:vo jqrcop001 1914405 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: No thanks, Mr. Shimura. I'm actually here to apologize on behalf of the Arataki Gang for the whole posting flyers incident...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914405 shimurakanbee 02.ogg Shimura Kanbei: Oh, that? Don't worry about it, your boss and his pals already came to apologize.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914405 shimurakanbee 03.ogg Shimura Kanbei: Not only did they take down all the flyers, they cleaned up the shop for me, too...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914405 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Wait, are you sure that was the Arataki Gang? Did the leader have horns on his head?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914405 shimurakanbee 04.ogg Shimura Kanbei: Sure did. Ah, it looks like at long last, they've turned over a new leaf...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914405 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: How is this possible...?
 Maybe it's your influence at work.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914405 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I find this all very hard to believe, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)... Let's head to Tsukumomono Groceries.
(Talk to Aoi, owner of Tsukomomono Groceries)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914406 aoi 01.ogg Aoi: Welcome to Tsukumomono Groceries. What can I do for you?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914406 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Sorry, Miss Aoi. I'm here on behalf of the Arataki Gang, regarding the incident with the flyers...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914406 aoi 02.ogg Aoi: Oh, the flyers? A bunch of guys came by and cleaned them up already. They also kept loudly proclaiming that they were gonna compensate me in full if it was the last thing they did...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914406 aoi 03.ogg Aoi: This whole thing really wasn't a huge deal, so I told them that if they really wanted to make it up to me, they could just buy something from the shop.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914406 aoi 04.ogg Aoi: They huddled together and discussed it for a while, and in the end they bought the most expensive item in the store... Even though all four of them had to empty their pockets to get enough Mora.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914406 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: What the... Have they really had a change of heart?
 See, your teaching was not in vain!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914406 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...There's one more person we need to apologize to, let's go.
(Go to the next person you need to apologize to)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914407 shouta 01.ogg Shouta: Hey! Girl in the mask!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914407 shouta 02.ogg Shouta: Guess what? The guy with the horns came to see me... and he gave me back all the snacks he won off me yesterday! Haha!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914407 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: W—Wow, did he? ...Well, I also brought some snacks, you can take them, too. Then you'll have extra in case they come to play cards with you again...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914407 shouta 03.ogg Shouta: No need! They promised they're never gonna take my snacks again!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914407 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Is this really the same Arataki Gang I know...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914407 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: No, I have to see it with my own eyes...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914407 shouta 04.ogg Shouta: Huh? Look, they're down there right now.
(Talk to Shouta again)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shouta 01.ogg Shouta: They're down there right now.

Key Decision[]

(Approach the Arataki Gang Members)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: It's really them... Huh, unbelievable.
(Talk to the Arataki Gang Members)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 amano 01.ogg Amano: Hey! Are you posting flyers again?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 mamoru 01.ogg Mamoru: No, no, we're innocent! We're cleaning them up!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: You Tenryou Commission types... maybe if you opened your eyes, you'd see that people can change, ever think of that?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 itto 02.ogg Arataki Itto: Playing the blame game before you even understand the situation... No wonder you're always catching the wrong people.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Ahem, sorry, Doushin. Please don't mind them, they're just a little over-excited.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 akira 01.ogg Akira: Ah, Shinobu and (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! We're saved!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I know how preposterous it sounds, but they have, in fact, been cleaning up the flyers. Numerous witnesses in this area can attest to that.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 amano 02.ogg Amano: But I just heard about a street gang who've been reported for posting flyers. And look at this thing...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 amano 03.ogg Amano: ...This is clearly the guy with the horns! Even the expression is identical!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 itto 03.ogg Arataki Itto: Ohohoho! Turns out this Tenryou blockhead's a real art connoisseur! Yeah, really captures my style, doesn't it?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 amano 04.ogg Amano: So you admit it, then? Right, that's it, you're coming with me to the Police Station!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Wait, please! I can explain...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 norika 01.ogg Norika: What's going on?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 amano 05.ogg Amano: So sorry, Madam Norika. I'm just stopping some hooligans from posting flyers...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 itto 04.ogg Arataki Itto: We already told you, we are innocent! Are you even listening?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 amano 06.ogg Amano: You've been detained at the Police Station for graffiti countless times. You're really trying to tell me you're an innocent man?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 itto 05.ogg Arataki Itto: Well, oni... but that's beside the point. It's different this time, I swear!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 norika 02.ogg Norika: Doushin, this is Miss Kuki, a business partner of mine. I can vouch for her honest and forthright character.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 norika 03.ogg Norika: If her friends have done anything wrong, she will not hide it. Perhaps we could hear her out first?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 norika 04.ogg Norika: After all, since we're gonna be working together in a few days... it would be a shame to let something like this come between us, don't you think?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 amano 07.ogg Amano: Working together... Oh, you mean, the thing Madam Kujou Sara briefed us on?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 amano 08.ogg Amano: Understood. We will hear your explanation.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: *sigh* Alright...
Kuki Shinobu explains the situation to Doushin Amano...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 amano 09.ogg Amano: I see. So you did post the flyers, but then you did the responsible thing and came back to clear them up...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 amano 10.ogg Amano: It seems I jumped to conclusions on this occasion. Please accept my apologies.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: No apology needed. We know how much trouble we've created for you in the past.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 norika 05.ogg Norika: *sigh* Well, I'm glad to see that the misunderstanding is resolved. Well, I will see you soon — I hope we can work together effectively.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 amano 11.ogg Amano: Most certainly, Ma'am.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 genta 01.ogg Genta: Boss... did you hear what they said...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 mamoru 02.ogg Mamoru: This means... Shinobu has already made her decision?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 itto 06.ogg Arataki Itto: Yep, looks like it's time for us to make a decision, too...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 itto 07.ogg Arataki Itto: Move to the backup plan!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Guys, chill... What are you up to now?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 together 01.ogg Arataki Gang Members: Shinobu... Thank you for everything!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 08.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Hey, what's this all about?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 itto 08.ogg Arataki Itto: Shinobu, this is a parting gift from all of us in the Arataki Gang. We all pitched in and bought you this from Tsukumomono Groceries.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 itto 09.ogg Arataki Itto: We know it's nothing compared to your salary in the Shogunate, but...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 09.ogg Kuki Shinobu: A Naku Weed bracelet...? What am I supposed to do with this?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 genta 02.ogg Genta: Shinobu! Don't forget about us when you're in the Tenryou Commission!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 mamoru 04.ogg Mamoru: We'll all try and be better people... and better oni. We promise to stay out of trouble and not make your job difficult!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 10.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Wait... who said I'm leaving?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 akira 02.ogg Akira: Also, Shinobu, when you couldn't find your snacks last week, the truth is... I ate them...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 genta 03.ogg Genta: And last month, I stole that toy we won, and when you came and asked me for it, I... I lied and I told you it was broken... *sobs*
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 11.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 itto 10.ogg Arataki Itto: Hey, no crying! We talked about this, send her off with a smile, alright? Who are we? We're... t—the Arataki Gang!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 itto 11.ogg Arataki Itto: Shinobu is moving on to better things. We should be happy for her!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 mamoru 05.ogg Mamoru: *sobs* ...You're right... You're right, Boss... *sobs*
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 genta 04.ogg Genta: The Arataki Gang... rules... *sobs*
 Ugh...
 Sh—Shinobu...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 12.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Hey, don't you start, too.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 norika 06.ogg Norika: Ah... Is this the Arataki Gang you mentioned, Miss Kuki? What an interesting group of people...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 13.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...Yes. Sorry for making a scene.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 norika 07.ogg Norika: Hmm, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Norika, a merchant who does business between Inazuma and Liyue. Recently, I've been negotiating a business deal with the Tenryou Commission regarding medical supplies.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 mamoru 06.ogg Mamoru: *sniff*... Huh? A merchant? Wait, so... you're not a Shogunate official?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 norika 08.ogg Norika: Of course not, I'm just a merchant. I was lucky enough to secure exclusive sales rights for some new first aid supplies from Bubu Pharmacy recently.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 norika 09.ogg Norika: So I thought I would ask the Tenryou Commission if they would be interested in establishing a long-term supply relationship. Injuries are a regular occurrence in the army, after all.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 norika 10.ogg Norika: Cross-border trade is a complicated affair, but fortunately, Madam Kujou Sara was able to bring in a legal consultant proficient in the laws of both nations.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 genta 05.ogg Genta: Oh... You mean... Shinobu?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 norika 11.ogg Norika: That's right. Thanks to Miss Kuki, our negotiations went very smoothly.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 norika 12.ogg Norika: The rest of the process will probably take another 10 to 15 days, after that, I will have to borrow Miss Kuki from you again for a while.
 I knew it...
 I thought so.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 14.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I can definitely spare the time — so long as these guys stay out of trouble.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 norika 13.ogg Norika: Ah, yes, I have a little compensation for you all: here, some trial packs of our new supplies.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 norika 14.ogg Norika: Miss Kuki tells me that you often find yourselves in injury-prone situations... I heartily recommend our product!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 mamoru 07.ogg Mamoru: This is unexpected...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 akira 03.ogg Akira: So she's really a merchant...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 itto 12.ogg Arataki Itto: Uh... hehe... Hahaha! Oh, you guys, I knew you must have gotten the wrong idea! Shinobu would never quit!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 itto 13.ogg Arataki Itto: Look at all this fuss you made over nothing! Pfft, planning a whole leaving ceremony...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 genta 06.ogg Genta: But... wasn't the backup plan your idea, Boss?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 itto 14.ogg Arataki Itto: Ahem! Alright, well, if we're done here, I'm gonna head to Tsukumomono Groceries and see if they'll let me return the bracelet...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 akira 04.ogg Akira: Wait up, Boss, we'll come with you!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 15.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Hold it right there.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 mamoru 08.ogg Mamoru: Eek!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 16.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Last week's snacks, last month's toy... What else aren't you telling me?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 genta 07.ogg Genta: Oh, uh... the thing is... you see...
 Shinobu, let it slide!
 Calm down, Shinobu!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 shinobu 17.ogg Kuki Shinobu: You've all got your new first aid supplies — don't you want to test them out?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914408 itto 15.ogg Arataki Itto: Run... Run... Run!

For Greater Strength[]
 Quest DescriptionNoelle has great strength but the path to greater strength is never-ending. Your suggestion to help her bring out yet more power is... mining.

Media:vo noecop001 1906601 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So we're really about to go mining...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: You two are something else! *sigh* Fine... let's go practice on some nearby outcrops.

(Upon arriving location)
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: This is it, let's clear up these outcrops!

(After breaking all Iron Chunks)
(Obtain Hard Iron Chunk ×3)
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: There are monsters nearby!
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Fighting monsters... That's just part of mining, right? Leave it to me!
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Paimon heard that rockfalls happen a lot around here... Keep your eyes open!

(After defeating the slimes)
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: More monsters? Mitachurls!?
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Looks like a tough opponent... I'll try to make this quick and easy!
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Noelle, slow down! Rockfalls can happen here!
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Sorry... understood! Stay behind me, let's move forward together.

(After defeating the Mitachurl)
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Wah! A rockfall! It's huge!
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: D—did I cause this...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: M—... Could just be a coincidence...
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Huh? Wait... Is that a Knight of Favonius up ahead? Let's find out what's going on!

(Talking to Belinda beforehand)
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 belinda 01.ogg Belinda: This is a rockfall-prone area. You shouldn't be stopping here without good reason.
(Talk to Belinda)
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 belinda 02.ogg Belinda: Whoa... what a rockfall!
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Ah... Ms. Belinda, is that you?
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 belinda 03.ogg Belinda: Is that Noelle? And the Honorary Knight, too?
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: A—Are you hurt?
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 belinda 04.ogg Belinda: Don't worry, I'm fine. I'd already passed through the rockfall zone on my patrol.
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 belinda 05.ogg Belinda: There's actually been a lot of rockfalls here lately... but it's the first time I've seen one of such magnitude during my patrols.
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 belinda 06.ogg Belinda: Did you guys see anything suspicious?
 No.
 Not at all.
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 belinda 07.ogg Belinda: Hmm... The more I think about it, surely nobody could be responsible for something of this scale.
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 belinda 08.ogg Belinda: *sigh* Regardless, this will be difficult to clear...
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 belinda 09.ogg Belinda: These are ore veins rich in reserves here, all blocked behind the boulders...
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Did you say, ore veins?
 ...Ore veins?
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 belinda 10.ogg Belinda: Yeah, I'll need to enlist some folks to clear this up quickly.
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 belinda 11.ogg Belinda: Otherwise, how will we ever get to the ore...
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Hmm, the ore...
 ...Ore?
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: So once the boulders are out the way, mining can start up again?
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 belinda 12.ogg Belinda: Precisely, but a rockfall of this magnitude needs reporting to the Knights first—
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: Leave it to me! I think I can handle this!
Media:vo noecop001 1906601 belinda 13.ogg Belinda: Uh... huh?

(After destroying the rocks)
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: She smashed the boulders to pieces...
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ah! Look out! A Stonehide Lawachurl!
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 belinda 01.ogg Belinda: A Stonehide Lawachurl? Is that the culprit behind the recent rockfalls?
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 belinda 02.ogg Belinda: I'll call for reinforcements!
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: It's a lot bigger than me, but I should have the upper hand when it comes to strength.
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: We'll be one step closer to mining once I've taken care of it! Leave it to me!

(After defeating the Lawachurl)
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Woah... that was intense... Finally a chance to catch our breath... uh, Noelle?
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: One, two, three, four... So many training targets...
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? More enemies? Where?

(After breaking all Crystal Chunks)
(Obtain Hard Crystal Chunk ×6–7)
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Phew...
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: ...Job done!
 So the training targets were just mining outcrops...
 Noelle really wasn't kidding about her strength...
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 belinda 03.ogg Belinda: Are you guys okay? Noelle... you're okay, right?
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Hmm? Oh, I'm okay! Though I must say...
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: ...My shoulders are sorer than usual, compared to my normal cleaning duties that is.
 Is cleaning up for the Knights that intense...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 belinda 04.ogg Belinda: I—I'm ashamed to admit that... even though we try and get Noelle to take it easy...
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 belinda 05.ogg Belinda: ...Every time we get back from somewhere, she's somehow single-handedly managed to clean the entire Knights of Favonius Headquarters.
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: A—All in a day's work for a maid of Favonius...
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: If I want to become a knight, I need to take all aspects of training seriously.
Media:vo noecop001 1906602 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: So, Honorary Knight... the ore mining training... H—How did I do?
 Your strength blew me away!
 You did much better than I expected. To be honest, at first I...

 Quest DescriptionIt turns out that the missing young detective was investigating a mysterious case on Watatsumi Island. According to him, something vital is missing on this island. What could it be?
The Camp's Secret[]

(Talk to Heizou before investigating the goods)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903904 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So, have you found anything?
 I'm about to start looking.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903904 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Good, better get a move on. I've already noticed a few things of interest. Let's meet back here later.
(Investigate the Sango Pearl)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903905 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ooh! What's this shiny thing? Oh! It's a Sango Pearl!
(Investigate the Crystal Marrow)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903906 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, isn't this Crystal Marrow?
(Talk to Heizou)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903905 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So, have you found anything?
 We found a bunch of Crystal Marrow and Sango Pearls.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903905 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Yes, I've found pretty much the same, and there really are a lot.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903905 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Aren't these all super expensive? Ohh, these must be the valuable things that went missing from the island! That's it, the Nobushi must've stolen them all!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903905 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Haha... I don't know if I'd go THAT far. The Nobushi would be very hard-pressed to find many opportunities to get their hands on commodities like these.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903905 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh? What do you mean? Did the Nobushi gather all this themselves?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903905 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: No, that's unlikely. Crystal Marrow is a rare material for crafting weapons and Sango Pearls are an even more precious commodity.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903905 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Here's what I think. Due to Watatsumi's poor soil, the island's economy is quite fragile and heavily reliant on the trade of these special resources.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903905 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So, it's absolutely vital that they keep them under lock and key and well out of the Nobushi's reach. Which means, they got lucky with a huge batch like this... my guess is they ambushed a caravan.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903905 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: If we go ask around at the Sangonomiya Shrine, we can find out if there have been any recent instances of caravans being plundered...
 I know someone at the shrine. Follow me.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903905 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Perfect, I knew you'd be a huge help.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903905 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Heh, well duh! The Traveler is Paimon's companion, after all.

(Go to Sangonomiya Shrine and talk to Shibata)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 shibata 01.ogg Shibata: Captain! I see you've found the detective.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Watatsumi Island sure is a beautiful place! I don't think I could ever leave.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 shibata 02.ogg Shibata: Haha, you can stay as long as you like, granted you don't cause any trouble, that is. Her Excellency has stated that all friendly visitors are welcome.
 I'd like to know whether any merchants or caravans have recently reported incidents of stolen goods.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 shibata 03.ogg Shibata: Incidents of stolen goods? Not that I'm aware of... Her Excellency has recently launched several measures to boost the economy, including the development of trade routes and establishing our own caravans.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 shibata 04.ogg Shibata: Troops have also been deployed to protect them, so it is only reasonable to assume that the current trade routes are already very safe. Any looting or theft would be practically unthinkable.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: That's strange... then where did the Nobushi get those goods from?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 shibata 05.ogg Shibata: Huh? You mean you found goods of unknown origin?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yep, and it's all Sango Pearls and Crystal Marrow, so we know it's local!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 shibata 06.ogg Shibata: Could there really have been a theft that hasn't been reported? That shouldn't be the case... Well, perhaps you could go ask Todoroki.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 shibata 07.ogg Shibata: He's responsible for the caravans and is usually in the village at night preparing the goods. If something has happened, he should know about it.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Great, thank you for all the info. (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), let's go.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Hey, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! It's been a while, I've missed you. Why didn't you inform me that you'd be coming over today?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 shibata 08.ogg Shibata: Ah, General Gorou!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: You're dismissed, Shibata. You may go about your other duties while I catch up with the Traveler.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 shibata 09.ogg Shibata: Yes, General Gorou!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: I overheard you discussing a case of stolen goods, is that right?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: That's right! We found a lot of Watatsumi's valuable products in a Nobushi camp!
You give the items you found at the Nobushi camp to Gorou.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: I see, so you've come to ask if we know of any relevant cases, well...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: *sigh* I'm ashamed to say that... yes, the caravans have been plundered, and not just once, I'm afraid.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: We had already dispatched additional forces to protect the caravans, yet the crooks still managed to get away with the goods...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: And you're concerned that if this kind of news were to get out, it would undermine the confidence of other caravans, so you didn't make it public and instead kept the news to only a select few.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: That's correct. I never expected you to be so concerned about Watatsumi's affairs, Detective Heizou.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hehe. Just a force of habit, really. As a detective, I notice these kinds of things.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, so you two already know each other?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: Actually, I've only heard of Detective Heizou from the soldiers' reports. We've never met in person.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Ah, darn it, you're right! Now that you mention it, I've been on Watatsumi Island all this time and still haven't properly introduced myself! Man alive, please forgive me!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It's a pleasure to meet you, General Gorou. I'm Shikanoin Heizou of the Tenryou Commission.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: Yes, it's a pleasure to meet you, too. I'd like to express my gratitude to you for stepping in and helping recover those goods.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Don't mention it. You never know what you'll find when you're out for a stroll.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But, if the source of the problem is not addressed, I'm afraid this sort of situation will continue cropping up for you.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: Yes, of course. Not only have we reassured the affected caravans, but we also dispatched personnel to investigate the culprits.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Their reports indicated that the stolen goods were being delivered to a merchant of the International Trade Association named Godot.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: It all seems pretty unusual. We suspect that there are bigger players behind Godot, and that their target is none other than Watatsumi Island's valuable resources.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: But unfortunately, it would be difficult for us to investigate further, given that...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Given that Ritou, the island where the International Trade Association is located, is not part of your territory. Yes, they have cleverly picked their base of operations.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: I can see you catch on quickly, Detective Heizou.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hehe. It's my guess that you're telling us this because you're going to ask us to assist you in finding who's behind all this, right?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 15.ogg Gorou: Haha, you're always thinking one step ahead. Yes, those were exactly my intentions... and of course, we will prepare a generous reward for you.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 16.ogg Gorou: With the recent end of the war, trade and commerce have now become an important component of Watatsumi Island's development. Ensuring safety of the trade routes is critical, and we can't afford any further incidents.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 17.ogg Gorou: So will you please help Watatsumi Island, Detective Heizou, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 heizou 12a.ogg Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 heizou 12b.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I'm willing to assist, but it all depends on what (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) wishes.
 As the captain of Swordfish II, it's my duty to help Watatsumi.
 Gorou is a good friend, we should do this for him regardless of the rewards.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 18.ogg Gorou: Great! With both Detective Heizou and the Traveler on the case, I'm sure it'll be solved in no time.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 19.ogg Gorou: The situation is now in your capable hands. I look forward to hearing your report when you get back.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 heizou 13.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Alright, we'll take care of it. (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), let's go discuss where to head from here.

A Time for Whispers[]

(Talk to Gorou again)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903907 gorou 20.ogg Gorou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), exercise caution when traveling to Ritou. If you come across any unexpected dangers, retreat first. Your safety is the priority. You must approach this issue with a long-term strategy in mind.
(Go to a nearby location and talk to Heizou)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey! Why are we talking way over here? You're not trying to get away from Gorou so he can't overhear us, are you?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Very perceptive. Seems even Paimon has her moments.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Let me ask you, do you believe in intuition?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? Intuition? Where are you going with this?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: My intuition tells me that General Gorou is lying.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What!? How could you say that! Although he did seem a little on the serious side today... But Gorou's a good guy!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Good people can be deceptive, too. After all, everyone has their secrets.
 What makes you say that?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Well, in my opinion, the timing of his appearance was a little too coincidental.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Sangonomiya's soldiers have been keeping an eye on me for the entire time I've been on Watatsumi Island, yet I had never seen General Gorou even once.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But today he came out and met with us, and even commissioned us to investigate a case.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 paimon 04a.ogg Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 paimon 04b.ogg Paimon: Maybe that's because (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) is here today, and Gorou thinks (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍)'s more capable.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Really? Then that makes things even more peculiar. If there are powerful players behind this case, and he needs to draw upon external support, then he should have taken action sooner rather than wait until today.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: A more plausible explanation is that the items we discovered are linked with some unspeakable secret, and he had to intervene to prevent us from digging any deeper.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Then he put up a smokescreen to mislead us. I surmise that investigating the merchant Godot on Ritou will yield no results.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Whoa, are you serious? But this is all just a hunch you have, right?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Actually, there is another key factor behind my reasoning, though you may not believe me.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 12.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I sense something... special about Gorou.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Something special?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 13.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Yes. Whatever is missing on this island, I sense it in him...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Wh—Wh—Whoa, hold it right there! Are you saying Gorou's a thief? As in, he took something valuable!?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 14.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It's not that simple, I can't fully explain it... It's just my intuition.
 This certainly doesn't line up with the Gorou I know.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 15.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Sure, I trust your judgment. But perhaps you're overlooking someone else — the true leader here.
 Alright, you've convinced me that there might be some secret here. What do we do?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 16.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It's simple. We should just investigate whatever it is they're trying to hide from us. And what were we planning to do just before Gorou showed up?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Hum, we were going to talk to the leader of the caravans. Oh yeah, someone named Todoroki!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 17.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Bingo. There's no time to lose, let's go talk to this Todoroki.
(Proceed to An Unexpected Discovery)
 No, you're overthinking this. We should go to Ritou and investigate this Godot character.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 18.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Haha, being too suspicious, am I? Well, even suspicious people have their duty to uphold...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903908 heizou 19.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Haha, in which case, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), I'll stay here and get back to you once I figure out what the secret of this place is.
Hangout Event Ended: Heizou promises that you shall meet again before leaving...

An Unexpected Discovery[]
 Step DescriptionIt turns out that the missing young detective was investigating a mysterious case on Watatsumi Island. According to him, something vital is missing on this island. What could it be?

(Wait until night (20:00–24:00))
(Head to Bourou Village and follow Todoroki and Tokuda)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905501 tokuda 01.ogg Tokuda: Todoroki, the shipment has arrived and is ready for inspection.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905501 todoroku 01.ogg Todoroki: Good, let's go.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905501 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, it's Todo... mmph!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905501 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Shh! Keep quiet. Let's follow him and see where he leads us.
(If the player gets too far away)

Media:vo lyycop001 1905502 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Man alive! We strayed too far and now we've lost him.
(Restarts stealth sequence)
(If the player gets too close)

Media:vo lyycop001 1905503 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Uh-oh! We got too close and he noticed us!
(Restarts stealth sequence)
(Listen in on Todoroki and Tokuda's conversation)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905504 tokuda 01.ogg Tokuda: Your intel was spot on. When we arrived, the Nobushi were all still asleep, haha.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905504 tokuda 02.ogg Tokuda: We captured them all, and the goods were retrieved and brought back here.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905504 todoroku 01.ogg Todoroki: I'll take a look. Hmm... Everything seems in order, good work.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905504 tokuda 03.ogg Tokuda: It's nothing. Thanks to the efforts of your caravan, the price of grain in the village has decreased.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905504 masashi 01.ogg Masashi: That's right, and who would have thought that the injuries we sustained during the war would have such a lingering effect on our bodies. But thankfully, you also brought back some life-saving medicine.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905504 todoroku 02.ogg Todoroki: Things are improving thanks to the help from those up top. By the way, what is the state of the village's inventory?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905504 todoroku 03.ogg Todoroki: Make sure that it's confirmed tonight, I have to leave tomorrow morning after I go to the Sangonomiya Shrine and get instructions from General Gorou.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905504 masashi 02.ogg Masashi: Don't worry. We've already prepared the list. Just follow us.

(Todoroki and Tokuda leave)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905505 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? The soldiers from Sangonomiya seized the Nobushi's stolen goods? But didn't Gorou say all the stolen goods were headed to the International Trade Association?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905505 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: And Todoroki said he'll get instructions from Gorou tomorrow. Interesting... It appears these seized goods were never stolen, there's something else behind all this.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905505 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Now's our chance to look around and see if we can find any leads.
(Talk to Heizou)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Alright, let's see what we can come up with here.
(Investigate the Glaze Lilies)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Glaze Lilies! What are these doing here? Shouldn't it be Crystal Marrow or something...
(Investigate the tightly packed box)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: This box is packed so tight, it looks like it could burst. Let's see what's inside.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? What are all these plants and flowers? Oh, there's a small note here.
Torn Bill: (A torn bill. The handwriting has been smudged by water stains, making it difficult to read. Only a faint outline of the words "Foreign Trade Association" can be seen at the signature.)
(Investigate the Qingxin)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905507 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa! Qingxin! Paimon was expecting to find Sango Pearls...

Middleman[]

(Talk to Heizou)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So, did you find anything?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa, look at all the Qingxin! And Glaze Lilies, too! There are also tons of other plants and flowers Paimon doesn't know here. Weird...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: These are valuable raw ingredients for producing medicine. If these few crates were to be imported from Ritou, the price would be jaw-dropping.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: On top of that, these items seem to lack a tax clearance certificate, meaning that they were most likely smuggled. Yes, very interesting... Now where did the Nobushi get these goods?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: How about you? Did you find anything else?
 There is a bill here addressed to the "Foreign Trade Association."
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Foreign Trade Association? I've never heard of such an organization in Ritou... and if it's regarding foreign trade, then smuggling is an even more likely possibility.
 Unfortunately, no.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Really? Hmm, I see...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Alright. In which case, I have a rough hypothesis, first we...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 01.ogg Tokuda: Huh! Who goes there!?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh no! We've been spotted!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 masashi 01.ogg Masashi: Huh? Wait, Captain... is that you!?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 02.ogg Tokuda: Oh! So it's you, Captain. You had me worried there, we almost mistook you for bandits, haha!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 03.ogg Tokuda: Captain, do you remember us? During the war, I was in the field hospital with Masashi. Teppei brought you to see us, and helped find medicine for us.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 masashi 02.ogg Masashi: Hey c'mon now! The captain wouldn't forget!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 masashi 03.ogg Masashi: I gotta tell you, Captain, we all miss you. We haven't seen you ever since the end of the war.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 masashi 04.ogg Masashi: When we heard that you were coming here, we just assumed you were only going to see General Gorou and Her Excellency. The guys are all really hoping to see you.
 Ahem... Uh, how have you all been?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 masashi 05.ogg Masashi: We're fine! You don't have to worry about us, Captain.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 04.ogg Tokuda: No, you're not fine. Captain, you may not be aware, but Masashi previously fainted on the front lines. The doctor thought that it might be a neurological condition caused by overstimulated emotions. It's pretty serious.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 05.ogg Tokuda: According to the doctor, if it hadn't been for the medication he's been taking, he would have developed dementia... and that was assuming the best-case scenario!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 masashi 06.ogg Masashi: You're one to talk! Don't forget why I fainted in the first place. It's because I heard that you got yourself killed by an arrow. I couldn't handle all the emotion.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 masashi 07.ogg Masashi: Later, I found out that he'd been shot in the buttocks and it was only a mild injury. I had an emotional breakdown for nothing!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 06.ogg Tokuda: What do you mean for nothing? I got shot not by one, but two arrows... in a row! The first arrow was to the left cheek, and the second arrow was also to the left!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 07.ogg Tokuda: And, because the arrows were poisonous, the wound still hasn't completely healed yet. I have to apply ointment every day and I am constantly worried it might reopen while I sleep.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 masashi 08.ogg Masashi: Look on the bright side. At least we're still alive.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 08.ogg Tokuda: Yeah, I suppose you're right. But enough about us, what brings you here, Captain?
 Tell me about these goods...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 masashi 09.ogg Masashi: Oh, these goods were all seized from the hands of Nobushi and Treasure Hoarders. Todoroki was the one who provided us with the intel.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 masashi 10.ogg Masashi: He mentioned there were bandits here and there, so we went and took care of them while also confiscating the goods.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 09.ogg Tokuda: By the way, Captain, you still haven't met Todoroki, have you? He's the one we're working for now.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 10.ogg Tokuda: Her Excellency recently announced plans to stimulate the economy and created the caravans, with Todoroki at the helm.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 masashi 11.ogg Masashi: Yeah, he's proven to be quite capable. Even though he was just a farmer before, he's now successfully running the caravans.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 masashi 12.ogg Masashi: And his two sons were also our brothers in arms, both received a special medal of honor from General Gorou, which is quite remarkable, don't you think?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 11.ogg Tokuda: So as injured veterans, we've been reassigned to Todoroki. He's the one who gives us orders and pays our salaries now.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 12.ogg Tokuda: What do they call that again...?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 masashi 13.ogg Masashi: It's called changing careers, dummy.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 13.ogg Tokuda: Ah right, changing careers. Anyway, I think the whole caravan thing is wonderful. Our region wasn't very prosperous to begin with, and the land can't grow any crops. We have to pay a hefty price just to get basic food from outside.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 14.ogg Tokuda: I can't even imagine trying to maintain and feed an army like we did during the war.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I see, I think I understand the general situation now. May I ask where the apprehended criminals are?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 masashi 14.ogg Masashi: Oh uh, and you are?
 Don't worry, he's a friend of mine.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 15.ogg Tokuda: Ah I see, the Captain's friend... it should be okay to tell you then. We apprehended all the culprits and escorted them to a temporary location not far from here.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 tokuda 16.ogg Tokuda: Unfortunately, Masashi and I have other duties tonight and won't be able to take you there. Why don't you wait for a moment and I'll find someone else to show you the way?
 It's alright, you can return to your duties. We'll find the way ourselves.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905506 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I'm pretty sure I've already got a grasp on what's going on. All I need now is to confirm it with the apprehended bandits. (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), let's go.

(Go with Heizou to where the inmates are imprisoned)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905510 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Are you still a little confused? Haha, let me help connect the dots, this whole thing was actually quite similar to a case I once worked on previously.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905510 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It was a case involving the trade of prohibited items, and they employed an old trick to execute the deal.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905510 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The culprit would first go strolling down the street, until they knocked over a pedestrian on purpose, using the opportunity to slip the prohibited goods into the unknowing pedestrian's pocket.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905510 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Once the intended recipient got word of it, they would find an excuse to harass the same pedestrian before stealing the goods from the pocket.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905510 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The pedestrian had no idea what happened from start to finish, and unknowingly functioned as a "middleman"... So, can you guess who the middleman was in this case?

(Talk to the inmates)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 nanao 01.ogg Nanao: Sir! Please forgive us, Sir! We are nothing more than petty thieves...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Sir? What, do I look like a Commissioner? Does my friend here look like a Commissioner to you?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 nanao 02.ogg Nanao: Uh... uh, officer! Officer!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: First, I'm gonna need to ask you a few questions.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 nanao 03.ogg Nanao: Uh, sure! Go ahead, ask anything!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The soldiers discovered many valuable goods in your camp. The goods don't appear to be from around here, so the question is, where did they come from?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 nanao 04.ogg Nanao: Oh, the goods? Right, we picked them up at the beach!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You picked them up?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 nanao 05.ogg Nanao: Uh, well, no... we uh, actually stole them.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Be honest now, tell me the whole story!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 nanao 06.ogg Nanao: Y—Yes, sir! Uh, I mean officer! We took those goods from a small merchant ship just off the beach, but we didn't exactly steal them...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 nanao 07.ogg Nanao: You see, the ship's guards all took off running the moment they saw us. They abandoned the goods, and we simply came and picked them up...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 nanao 08.ogg Nanao: But, next thing we know, a group of soldiers arrives and we're all apprehended. Talk about bad luck! We didn't even have a chance to stash away the goods before we got caught!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You say that the merchant ship's guards fled without putting up a fight? Heh, you expect me to believe that?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 nanao 09.ogg Nanao: We just assumed they were scared witless and didn't have the guts to fight. I'm not bragging or anything, but our boss is pretty intimidating. With his massive muscle and strength, he could scare anyone!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hah, you really expect us to believe all this!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 nanao 10.ogg Nanao: No, you gotta believe me. Just the other day, we scared off an entire squad of soldiers! When they noticed us, they went running and dropped their goods. I swear!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 nanao 11.ogg Nanao: I still remember seeing tons of Sango Pearls and Crystal Marrow in that load! All nice and shiny, too. It was amazing!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 nanao 12.ogg Nanao: Unfortunately, a bunch of pirates came later and snatched those goods. It just happened that our boss had diarrhea that day and couldn't hold off the pirates. *sigh* This luck of ours...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Wait a tick, pirates?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 nanao 13.ogg Nanao: Yep, no doubt about it. They came on a massive ship, and their captain was a pretty lady wearing an eye patch... We had no idea how powerful she was!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 nanao 14.ogg Nanao: It was like... BOOM BOOM THUD! Only took three hits before she knocked out the boss.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: *gasp* A pretty lady with an eye patch!?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Oh? Does this description remind you of someone, Paimon?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Uh, ahem... n—no! Doesn't remind Paimon of anyone!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Okay, and how about you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 Uh, me neither.
 Come to think of it, all pirates wear eye patches.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hehe, really? Okay, I'll take that as a no, then.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It appears that the situation is just as I suspected. Todoroki is striking a shady deal with a group of pirates, while General Gorou appears to be assisting with the cover-up...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: B—But... how could that be?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 12.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), Todoroki said that he'd be going to Sangonomiya early tomorrow morning to get Gorou's instructions before the caravan leaves.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 13.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Now is the time to address any doubts you may have. Tomorrow morning will be our moment to confront them.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 14.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hopefully, my final question will be answered then as well.
 Your final question?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 15.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The question of what important thing this island is missing...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 16.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I can feel some connection to the question in Gorou, Todoroki, and even Tokuda and Masashi.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 17.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hopefully, we'll finally have an answer tomorrow.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905508 heizou 18.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Let's get some rest. I'll see you at Sangonomiya tomorrow morning.
(Talk to Nanao)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 nanao 01.ogg Nanao: Officer, don't forget to tell the officials how cooperative we've been! Please put in a good word for us!

(Wait until the following day (08:00–12:00))

Confrontation[]

(Question Todoroki)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 01.ogg Todoroki: Ahem... uh, who are you?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hello, Todoroki. I'm Shikanoin Heizou, special detective of the Tenryou Commission.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I believe you've been manipulating large-scale illegal trades for some time now. Mind if we talk about that for a bit?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 02.ogg Todoroki: You can't just go around spewing such nonsense, young man.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: And what if I'm not talking nonsense?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 03.ogg Todoroki: Ridiculous! I don't have time to listen to this. Get out of here, you little brat!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Haha, I know I'm on the younger side compared to you, Todoroki. So I'm sure you must have heard the old saying:
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: "Off the scale, some goods only weigh a couple pounds. But on the scale, they weigh more than a thousand."
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So the question is, do you want to put your goods on the scale or not?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 04.ogg Todoroki: Wh—What are you trying to say?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Well, nothing. All I want to hear is you personally confirming what we already know to be the truth.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 05.ogg Todoroki: Argh... Masashi! Tokuda! Arrest these people!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 masashi 01.ogg Masashi: Huh? Todoroki, what's wrong!?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 tokuda 01.ogg Tokuda: Who dares to cause trouble at Sangonomiya Shrine! Huh!? Wait, it's...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 tokuda 02.ogg Tokuda: Captain? What are you doing...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 06.ogg Todoroki: These crooks are trying to pry into the secrets of Watatsumi. We mustn't let them go!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 masashi 02.ogg Masashi: But uh, no... There must be some kind of misunderstanding. Todoroki...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 masashi 03.ogg Masashi: This is the captain of Swordfish II, one of our own, haha!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 07.ogg Todoroki: It doesn't matter who they are. Remember what General Gorou told you? The long-term goal of Watatsumi is to revive its trade and commerce. And since you have been assigned to work with me, it's my orders that count around here!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 08.ogg Todoroki: I don't care if they were your captain. Would you dare disobey orders!?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 tokuda 03.ogg Tokuda: I... Uh...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 masashi 04.ogg Masashi: What do we do?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 09.ogg Todoroki: Well, what are you waiting for!?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 10.ogg Todoroki: Alright, I see how it is. If you two won't do it, I will.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I really hoped it wouldn't come to this... but, here we go.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Wait! Everyone, stand down!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 masashi 05.ogg Masashi: General Gorou! You're here!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: My apologies, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), and Detective Heizou. I wasn't telling you the truth.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 03a.ogg Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 03b.ogg Gorou: Todoroki, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) here is the hero who saved Watatsumi Island. Without (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍), Watatsumi Island would never have found the peace it has today. We mustn't raise our weapons against (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍).
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 11.ogg Todoroki: How could you be so naive, General Gorou...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 12.ogg Todoroki: If we let them go free, then who's to say that the Shogunate won't come after us tomorrow? If the Shogunate decides to investigate, we won't be able to hide the truth.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: I wouldn't allow them to take you, Todoroki.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 13.ogg Todoroki: *sigh*... Let's not kid ourselves. If going to jail could solve the problem, I would go and turn myself in to the Tenryou Commission right now.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 14.ogg Todoroki: The question is, what are we going to do with the goods? Will you be able to keep them? Not to mention the chance of astronomical fines! Can you afford that?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 15.ogg Todoroki: Gorou, we both know that Watatsumi Island is a barren land. Plant a hundred radishes here and maybe only three would grow, and those three combined would still be smaller than just one carrot imported from elsewhere.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 16.ogg Todoroki: You can't grow food or medicinal herbs here. And if we buy them from Ritou, we pay exorbitant taxes.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 17.ogg Todoroki: My eldest son died fighting on the battlefield. But do you know how my second son died? He died because there was no medicine to treat him!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 18.ogg Todoroki: You awarded both of them medals of honor, but did that save their lives? Can medals heal Tokuda and Masashi's wounds?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 19.ogg Todoroki: No, it was the medicine that I got that saved their lives!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 20.ogg Todoroki: If we detain them today, the Shogunate will never know what we've done. Besides, we're only a few months away now...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 21.ogg Todoroki: We will set them free once the new bill is passed in just a few months, and everything will be okay. None of what happened here will be mentioned again, and life on Watatsumi Island will continue to improve.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: I understand, Todoroki, but they won't—
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 22.ogg Todoroki: I can trust the Traveler won't, but the detective here is a Tenryou Commission officer!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 23.ogg Todoroki: *sigh*... Forget it! You're the general, and I'm just a radish farmer...
 Wait, what is the bill you just mentioned?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: ...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: It's a new commodity tax bill currently being drafted by the Kanjou Commission. The bill exempts taxes on goods that are in short supply on Watatsumi Island.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: Once the bill is introduced, we'll be able to buy commodities that we need from regular marketplaces...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Oh, I see! Man alive...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I wish I had known sooner. Hehe, in that case, how about we put your fears at ease and I'll stick around here a little longer.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You know, until the bill is introduced.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 24.ogg Todoroki: Huh?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: Detective Heizou, are you saying that...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 todoroku 25.ogg Todoroki: You mean you are willing to stay here, young man?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 12.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: C'mon you two, what's with the strange looks?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 13.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You've been keeping me under close surveillance, haven't you? Surely you must have noticed that, aside from being a detective, I am also an ordinary tourist who likes to enjoy good scenery?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 14.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I believe that after the new commodity bill is passed, there will be more and more traffic between the two sides, and more and more people will be coming to visit Watatsumi Island.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 15.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I have to take the opportunity now and enjoy this place while I still have it all to myself. Before long, tourists will start pouring in!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: Thank you, Detective Heizou, on behalf of the people of Watatsumi!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 16.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: My pleasure, but one good turn deserves another, does it not...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Oh, you mean there's something you wish to request?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 17.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I suppose you could say I'm from the Shogunate, but the Traveler next to me isn't.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 18a.ogg Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 18b.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: As far as I know, (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍) is planning to visit other nations soon, and it is unclear if (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍) will return to Narukami Island or not. Therefore, there's no need to limit (‍hishisText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) freedom, right?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 19.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I'm sure no one else will hear of what happened today, am I right, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 (Make a loud and resounding promise.)
 (Agree with a cool nod.)
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 12a.ogg Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 12b.ogg Gorou: Well, it's settled then. (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) will always be an important partner to Watatsumi, and I would never dream of limiting (‍hishisText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) freedom. So please don't worry, Detective Heizou.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 20.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I'll hold you to that. But if I ever find out you've lied to me again, there's a chance I'll lose my cool.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: I'm sorry for not telling you the truth earlier. It's a serious matter, and I didn't want outside parties to become involved.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: But today I realized my poor judgment. How could I possibly hide anything from Detective Heizou and the Traveler?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 21.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Haha! I'm glad you understand now!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 22.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But, in all honesty, I'm the one who should be thanking you.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 23.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It's because of you that I was finally able to reach an answer. After all, nothing makes a detective happier than putting a case to rest.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 15.ogg Gorou: Ah, I understand now. You really are an interesting person, Detective Heizou.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 24.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: No, I'm afraid you don't quite get what I mean.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 16.ogg Gorou: ...I'm sorry?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wait wait! Paimon gets this one! It's the answer to your question, right? The one about the thing you sensed coming from Gorou and the others? Now you've figured it out!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 gorou 17.ogg Gorou: Huh? The thing you sensed coming from me? But I always have excellent personal hygiene...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hehe, no, not like that!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905509 heizou 25.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hehe. Hey (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), could I talk to you for a moment? Besides, I haven't had a chance to thank you yet.
(Talk to Gorou again)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905512 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: I apologize again for not being completely honest with you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). I truly am sorry, but... I had to do it.
 I understand.
 By the way, does Kokomi know about all this?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905512 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Ah yes, Her Excellency... Well, let's just say that the war brought many terrible things while also forcing us to learn a lot.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905512 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Right, but that still doesn't answer the question.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905512 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: Well, ahem... aren't you curious about who's been pushing for the new commodity bill? It certainly isn't the Kanjou Commission, because it doesn't immediately benefit them, and we don't have any connections there.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905512 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yeah... it's kinda as if the gods suddenly appeared to offer you a divine hand.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905512 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Haha, yeah, the gods...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905512 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: I was invited to attend the Irodori Festival on Narukami Island with Her Excellency a while back.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905512 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: At the festival, I waited in the marketplace while Her Excellency...
 Went to see Lady Yae.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905512 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: Yeah.
 What did she do...? I don't remember.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905512 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: She went to the Kanjou Commission to see Lady Yae — purportedly for a book review, but there were other items on the agenda, too. The meeting wasn't made public.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905512 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: Following her return, we began our attempts at boosting commercial activity, and it wasn't long before there was a push for a new commodity bill on Narukami Island...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905512 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: So, what do you make of it? Do you think Her Excellency knows about this?

(Go to a nearby location and talk to Heizou)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hey, there you are. Come here. Look, look! It's beautiful, isn't it? Watatsumi Island...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It's remarkable how such a barren land can give life to such wonderful and stunning scenery.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: To be honest, I'm grateful to you for this trip. Before you arrived, I was running around like a headless chicken, haha.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Even if I had happened to find out what was going on here, I wouldn't have been able to uncover any concrete information without you present.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I'm just sorry that I promised I'd accompany you back, it appears that I won't be able to do so for the time being. So please, cover for me in the meantime, okay? Haha.
 Have you really decided to keep the whole thing a secret?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Ah, it's all in the past now, let's just chalk it up as an intriguing experience I had on my trip here. Besides, that's not what I wanted to investigate anyway.
 So now you have the answer you were searching for?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Yes, everyone you led me to and everything they said brought me closer to the answer, and now I finally get it.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Watatsumi Island is an ancient land where the soil is poor and many crops do not grow, because it's lacking a certain thing.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But what the inhabitants of this land do have is bravery. They were courageous enough to stand up and resist the gods, and accomplish what they knew could not be done... This is yet another instance in which that certain thing shines.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: That missing element... That certain thing... is what I sensed present in Gorou, Todoroki, Tokuda, and Masashi...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Which is... the true vitality of this land.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 12.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I guess I was mistaken when I declared that something was missing, that something from this island had evaporated into thin air... Because even something that evaporates is not gone. It's still there, just in a different state of being.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 13.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: When water is heated by fire, it evaporates and eventually finds its place in the sky. Similarly, when the land was harmed, its vitality evaporated and eventually found its place among the inhabitants.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 14.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: This is the final answer I've been searching for.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 15.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Anyway, thanks again, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 16.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You know, even though we've just met, I wish you could be my partner all the time. Haha, call me greedy, I guess.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 17.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But of course, I know that's impossible. You have your own journey to complete.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 18.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So I'll just keep doing what I can — hopefully keeping my memories from evaporating, safe and sound in my mind.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905511 heizou 19.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: That way, I'll always be able to remember these beautiful things, the beauty of Watatsumi Island, the people who are full of life and vitality... and you two, who were by my side.

(Give the housekeeping course materials you collected to Thoma)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 35.ogg Thoma: Great, that's all the ingredients we need. Time to hit the streets and launch our grand advertising campaign.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 36.ogg Thoma: As it happens, I know someone in town who runs a textiles business. I'm sure she must know lots of people interested in housekeeping.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 37.ogg Thoma: So let's pay her a visit.

(Talk to Ogura Mio)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 oguramio 01.ogg Ogura Mio: Welcome to Ogura Textiles & Kimo... Oh! Hi, Thoma! What brings you here?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 oguramio 02.ogg Ogura Mio: Looking to buy some fabric? We have a new batch in — it's a great choice if you're looking to make loungewear...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: It sounds interesting, I'll take a look! But, the main reason I'm here today, though, is to pick your brain about something.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 oguramio 03.ogg Ogura Mio: Oh? And what might that be?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Well, we're thinking of starting a housekeeping class.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Problem is, I'm not sure where to go looking for students. So I was wondering if you might help me spread the word.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Among other things, I'll be teaching some handy sewing techniques. So, providing everything goes smoothly, I'll be needing to buy quite a lot of fabric from your store.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Do you think you'd be able to lend a hand?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 oguramio 04.ogg Ogura Mio: Of course, it'd be my pleasure! And thank you for supporting my business, Thoma.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 oguramio 05.ogg Ogura Mio: As it happens, several of my regular customers do have an interest in housekeeping.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 oguramio 06.ogg Ogura Mio: After I've closed up for the day, I'll go and talk to them for you. I'm almost certain that they'll want to sign up.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 oguramio 07.ogg Ogura Mio: The only thing is, I'm not sure there's enough of them for a whole class... Ah, I know — Yuuko is supposed to be very well connected in the community. Why don't you go and ask her?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Yuuko? Hmm... I'm sure I've heard that name somewhere before.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: So she has an interest in housekeeping?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 oguramio 08.ogg Ogura Mio: If I remember correctly, she mentioned in conversation once that she's tried knitting a sweater a few times, but just can't get the hang of it.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 oguramio 09.ogg Ogura Mio: With your housekeeping expertise, I'm sure you'd be able to get her interested.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Great. Thanks for all your help, Miss Ogura.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911401 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: Alright, let's go try our luck with Yuuko, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).

(Talk to Yuuko)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuuko 01.ogg Yuuko: Honestly, my husband doesn't lift a finger around the house...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuuko 02.ogg Yuuko: The moment he's home on his day off, it's shoes off and straight to bed so he can just lie there doing nothing.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuri 01.ogg Yuuri: *sigh* I have one of those at home, as well...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuri 02.ogg Yuuri: I know his work is tiring, but recently I've been really struggling with all the housework. It's starting to give me a backache.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuuko 03.ogg Yuuko: They act like it's our job just because we do it. But nobody trained us either...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Hello, ladies. Might I ask which one of you is Yuuko?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuuko 04.ogg Yuuko: That would be me. Sorry, I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: I'm Thoma, the housekeeper for the Yashiro Commission.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: We're looking to start a housekeeping class at the Commission headquarters. I was just wondering whether that might be something that interests you.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuuko 05.ogg Yuuko: Housekeeping? As a class?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: That's right, yes. We'll be teaching a whole bunch of handy housework tips and tricks. Sweeping, mopping, laundry, cookery, you know, that sort of thing. All based on my years of experience as a housekeeper.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: The class is free, of course. The only cost to you is the materials used during the class.
(Yuuko and Yuuri whisper at each other)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuuko 06.ogg Yuuko: What do you think?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuri 03.ogg Yuuri: I think this is suspiciously coincidental...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Well, I'll be straight with you, ladies... I believe the classes are free for a limited time only, right (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 That's right.
 If I were you, I'd take the chance while it's there.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: So far, attendance has been a little on the slow side, so we decided to start offering free trial classes. In other words, we won't charge you for the first few classes you attend.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: After the trial period comes to an end and if you're still satisfied with the results, you can book more classes for yourself and complete the rest of the course. I'll be sure to give you a favorable price.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuuko 07.ogg Yuuko: I see... It certainly sounds reasonable.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuuko 08.ogg Yuuko: But I have a question... Is this class restricted to women only?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: Not at all! It's open to people of all genders and ages. The way I see it, housework comprises an essential set of skills that no one can afford to be without.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: You've got to know how to look after yourself. Life should come before work, don't you think?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuuko 09.ogg Yuuko: Well said. In that case, I'll bring my husband along. Sounds like he could learn a thing or two from you.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuri 04.ogg Yuuri: Me too!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuri 05.ogg Yuuri: Oh, and while you're at it, have you thought about asking Nagano?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuri 06.ogg Yuuri: I'm sure older folks like him would have time to attend. The more the merrier, right?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 yuuko 10.ogg Yuuko: Thank you, Thoma. Please excuse us.
(Yuuri and Yuuko leave)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911402 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Alright, I'll see if I can convince the older folks to come along and make up the numbers.

(Talk to Nagano)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911403 nagano 01.ogg Nagano: Housekeeping class, eh...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911403 nagano 02.ogg Nagano: I was handy around the home back in the day. Sadly, the older I get, the fewer things I'm able to do myself.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911403 nagano 03.ogg Nagano: You're very young. Are you quite sure you're up to the task of teaching housekeeping? It's not as easy as you might think.
 Thoma is a housekeeping expert.
 Don't underestimate Thoma!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911403 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: I will do my very best.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911403 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: As housekeeper for the Kamisato Clan, I've been honing my craft for a long time now. I believe I'm up to the task.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911403 nagano 04.ogg Nagano: Very good, young man! Well then, I shall have to come and see for myself.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911403 nagano 05.ogg Nagano: If you are as good as you claim to be, I will encourage everyone I know to attend your classes. And if I find your skills to be lacking, I will be quite happy to teach a few things myself.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911403 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: What can I say — we'll be honored to have you in attendance, Sir.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911403 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Well then... that will probably just about do it as far as promotion is concerned. Let's head back to the Yashiro Commission, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
(Talk to Nagano again)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911403 nagano 05.ogg Nagano: If you are as good as you claim to be, I will encourage everyone I know to attend your classes. And if I find your skills to be lacking, I will be quite happy to teach a few things myself.

Housekeeping Course, Begin![]

(Return to the Yashiro Commission to make final preparations)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911404 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: To be honest, with this being my first time holding a class, I've got no idea how many people to expect.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911404 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: I just hope it goes well. Anyway, tonight I'll set up the tables and chairs, then tomorrow we can meet back at the Yashiro Commission headquarters.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911404 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: So, what do you think the turnout will be like, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 I'm sure lots of people will come.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911404 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: I sure hope so. We promoted it pretty hard, after all.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911404 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: This is the weirdest feeling. Housekeeping has always been something I do alone, but now I'm about to face a class full of students.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911404 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: You'd better show up to class tomorrow!
 I'm not super optimistic...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911404 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: Haha, truth be told, I'm a little nervous myself.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911404 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: But I'm sure it will turn out okay. We put in the legwork, after all.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911404 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: Guess we'll have to wait and see what tomorrow brings. As for tonight, I need a good rest.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911404 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: See you tomorrow, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!

(Go to the Yashiro Commission to take part in the housekeeping course)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Welcome, one and all. This is my first time teaching a housekeeping class, just as, I'm sure, it's your first time attending one.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: I'd like to start from the theory, if I may, and talk a little bit about why mastering the discipline of housekeeping is such an important thing.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 oguramio 01.ogg Ogura Mio: Quick, come in, Thoma's started the class already.
 There's so many people...
 Everyone looks keen to learn.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 oguramio 02.ogg Ogura Mio: Well, of course. No one's ever held a class like this in the past.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 oguramio 03.ogg Ogura Mio: I saved you a place. Please take a seat.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: The way I see it, housekeeping is a unique skillset that empowers you to set your life in order.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Nowhere are these skills more pertinent than in the context of a marital relationship. In a marriage, the lives of two people become closely intertwined.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: If you can't look after yourself properly, that burden ends up being shouldered by your partner. This, in turn, will start to take a toll upon the relationship...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Umm... huh, what are you doing here?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 kazumasa 01.ogg Kazumasa: What the...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 furusawa 01.ogg Furusawa: Huh?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 yuuko 01.ogg Yuuko: I brought him. Didn't you say men can study housekeeping too?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 yuri 01.ogg Yuuri: Wipe that look off your face! Aren't you going to greet the teacher?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 kazumasa 02.ogg Kazumasa: No, it's... I...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 yuuko 02.ogg Yuuko: Darling?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 kazumasa 03.ogg Kazumasa: H—Hello, teacher.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 furusawa 02.ogg Furusawa: For the love of... Hello, teacher.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: Well hello, and welcome. Now that you're here, I expect you to pay attention and work hard.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Well, let's keep going. Housekeeping is not difficult per se — the difficult part is consistency: keeping on top of it over a long stretch of time.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: To keep up with housework on an ongoing basis, you either have to love everything about it, or you need a few tricks up your sleeve to make things easier. So, for today's topic, we're going to focus on "How to make light work... of housework!"
 (Thoma is taking to this quite well...)
 (So far so good.)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: Excuse me, you over there. Focus, please.
(The camera pans to Traveler, who looks dozing off)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: I like to see active engagement in my lessons.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911405 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: That is unless some of you are looking to stay behind after class to catch up...

Media:vo kycop001 1908001 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: I've heard that there's lots to see and do in Liyue, but I'm sure you're more familiar with the place than I am. So I'll leave the itinerary to you.
 I have friends all over Liyue, and can score discounts galore.
Media:vo kycop001 1908001 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Excellent. Well, hopefully I'll get to know some of these friends for myself.
 I know all the best scenic spots. Can't go wrong when you're with me.
Media:vo kycop001 1908001 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Great! Maybe you can tell me about your previous travels here along the way.
Media:vo kycop001 1908001 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: It's such a satisfying feeling to just drop everything, go on a long trip, and see something new.
Media:vo kycop001 1908001 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Who knows who we might cross paths with? We might even end up going on an impromptu adventure. Just like how I met you in Port Ormos, and now we're here. Come on, let's see what's up ahead.
(Approach Mingxing Jewelry)
Media:vo kycop001 1908002 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Do you know this shop? It looks pretty nice from the outside. Shall we take a look?
(Talk to Xingxi)
Media:vo kycop001 1908002 xingxi 01.ogg Xingxi: Welcome to Mingxing Jewelry. We are a long-established trader of precious stones. Is there anything in particular you're looking for?
Media:vo kycop001 1908002 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Let me see... Ah, some nice jewelry you've got here. Maybe I can grab something with a local flavor as a souvenir.
Media:vo kycop001 1908002 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: What do you think, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? See anything that suits my style? I trust your judgment.
 Already buying souvenirs on the first day of your trip?
 Goods from Mingxing Jewelry don't come cheap. Are you sure?
 Actually, let's check if they sell anything off the shelf.
Media:vo kycop001 1908002 xingxi 02.ogg Xingxi: Ah, you're interested in souvenirs? If you're struggling to decide, you might want to consider getting some jade. You can't go wrong with a nice jade pendant. They're an elegant addition to your look whatever your age or gender.
Media:vo kycop001 1908002 xingxi 03.ogg Xingxi: If you're looking for a specific design, we can make it to your specifications. It does take some time to fulfill an order, however... High quality jade is hard to come by, so our waiting list is at least a couple of weeks.
Media:vo kycop001 1908002 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Oh, that's a pity. I'm just visiting, and I won't be in town for very long. So as much as it pains me to do so, I'm afraid I'll have to leave these beautiful bijoux behind.
Media:vo kycop001 1908002 xingxi 04.ogg Xingxi: No worries at all, Sir. If you're looking for something off the shelf, why not go and see Mr. Shitou at The Jade Mystery? He also deals in jade and precious stones.
 Ah, the guy with the uncut stones.
 Ah, you the jade-betting guy.
Media:vo kycop001 1908002 xingxi 05.ogg Xingxi: Exactly. But on that note, let me give you a word of advice.
Media:vo kycop001 1908002 xingxi 06.ogg Xingxi: There's no risk in purchasing a piece of jade that's already been cut, but you could lose all of your Mora betting on uncut rocks.
Media:vo kycop001 1908002 xingxi 07.ogg Xingxi: Hehe, I won't say any more, as I don't want my fellow vendors to think I'm bad-mouthing them. But I think you catch my drift.
Media:vo kycop001 1908002 xingxi 08.ogg Xingxi: It's only human nature to spend a little when you're on a trip, but don't be too hasty to part with your cash.
Media:vo kycop001 1908002 xingxi 09.ogg Xingxi: The Ministry of Civil Affairs takes everyone's economic well-being very seriously, and they often send out the Millelith to spread public awareness of well-known scams. As guests here, I'd encourage you to watch out for anyone trying to rip you off.
Media:vo kycop001 1908002 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: I think that's sound advice wherever you go in Teyvat. We appreciate it, Boss.
(Talk to Shitou)
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 01.ogg Shitou: Welcome! Looking for uncut stones, or pre-cut jade? We've got plenty of both for your viewing pleasure!
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Uncut stones? Ah yes, we were just briefed on that... Hmm, let's take a look at the pre-cut jade.
 (We should be careful...)
 (We mustn't rush into a purchase...)
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 02.ogg Shitou: I believe I detect a quiet but distinct tone of apprehension in your words! Please rest assured, there's nothing to be quite so wary about with my business.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 03.ogg Shitou: Feel free to peruse at your leisure. I think you'll find that everything I do here is entirely above-board and legitimate, and I sell only pure and unadulterated goods. No scam, guaranteed.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 04.ogg Shitou: Sure, you can bet on jade and lose if you're unlucky, but that doesn't make it a scam.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 05.ogg Shitou: My terms are clear and transparent, and I only do business with willing customers. What scammer can claim that?
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Sounds perfectly reasonable. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how much the vendor is charging — if the customer decides to hand over their money, they're taking the bait of their own free will.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 06.ogg Shitou: Yes, exactly, I'm glad you understand！...Although, your peculiar phrasing at the end there... You almost make it sound as if I really am scamming people...
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 07.ogg Shitou: Ahem, anyway, betting on jade is what it is! Feel free to try your luck, but if you can't afford to lose, then it's not for you. We don't need to cause each other any trouble.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 08.ogg Shitou: I'll leave you to browse at your own pace now while I deal with other potential customers.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Hmm... Amber-colored jade would probably make for a good souvenir...
 Are you really thinking of buying it?
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Why not? This is a quirky little place. Somehow, I'm inclined to entertain him for a bit.
 These Cor Lapis pieces are a Mora a dozen.
 I have better-quality pieces than these.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Well, if you're not interested, then I guess we'll pass.
(Captain Wu walks over)
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 09.ogg Shitou: Ahoy there, Captain! Fancy seeing you back in town. Struck any gold lately?
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 captainwu 01.ogg Captain Wu: What, a poor sailor like me? You must be joking. I barely manage to make ends meet. What about you, Shitou? Still scamming people with your pile of rocks?
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 10.ogg Shitou: Hey, keep your voice down, can't you see I've got customers? But more to the point, when have you ever seen a customer get scammed in my store?
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 captainwu 02.ogg Captain Wu: I mean, you want the full list? Or... Hold up, is that...
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 captainwu 03.ogg Captain Wu: Captain Kaeya! What, uh, brings you to Liyue? Heh...
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: ...Oh, just taking a short trip with my friend. It's been a while.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 captainwu 04.ogg Captain Wu: Yes... It's been a good while, hasn't it, haha.
Kaeya: ...
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Anywhere you'd recommend I visit while I'm here?
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 captainwu 05.ogg Captain Wu: Let me think... Wanmin Restaurant's always a pretty good bet. Chef Mao's daughter is a skilled chef, and their prices are very reasonable. My wife can't get enough of their boiled fish. You could give that a try.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 captainwu 06.ogg Captain Wu: And uh, speaking of my wife — she won't let me forget what a great help you've been to us before... So thank you, on her behalf.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Your wife? ...Ah yes, how is she doing these days? Keeping well?
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 captainwu 07.ogg Captain Wu: Very well, thank you, very well... Anyway, uh, I've got something I need to do down at the south wharf, so my apologies, Captain Kaeya, but I'd better get going.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Alright, see you.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: ...Ah, I've finally remembered who that was. Captain Wu, he runs a transport business between Mondstadt and Liyue.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 11.ogg Shitou: I see... So you went through that whole conversation with no idea who you were talking to. Well, that explains the generic pleasantries... and the general awkwardness.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 12.ogg Shitou: Old Wu's usually quite the chatterbox, so it's very unusual for him to just take off mid-conversation... How exactly do you two know each other, anyway?
 Maybe he owes Kaeya money?
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Nope, that's not it. I don't give out loans.
 Maybe he owes Kaeya a favor?
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: An educated guess. Yes, you could put it like that.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: It's pretty straightforward, honestly. The captain was making a delivery to Mondstadt when his ship sprang a leak. He overexerted himself fixing it and keeping the cargo dry, and ended up passing out from exhaustion. I took him to Mondstadt to recover.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 13.ogg Shitou: Hmm, well it still seems strange to me. Sure, he's hardly the most charming conversationalist, and he's also mighty stubborn, but all of us know old Wu as an honest and kindhearted man.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 14.ogg Shitou: His eldest was once playing on that big rock over there when he took a tumble and injured himself. I helped to patch the kid up, and the next day, old Wu was here to buy a couple of uncut stones.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 15.ogg Shitou: I'm just surprised he was so quick to excuse himself, that's all. Normally, he's the kind of guy who, if you run into him on the street and he owes you a favor, he'll grab you by the hand and thank you profusely until you ask him to stop...
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: Well, "stubborn" I can believe. Someone had drilled a gaping hole in his ship, and the water was coming in fast. How he managed to make it all the way to Mondstadt, not to mention with his cargo intact, I have no idea.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 16.ogg Shitou: Someone drilled a hole in his ship!? ...Oh dear, it must have been one of the less savory captains out there trying to sabotage his business, so they can squeeze their way into the market... When competition is stiff, sometimes things get ugly. It's the way of the world, unfortunately.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 17.ogg Shitou: His line of work isn't easy — the poor fellow usually has to set sail before the break of dawn. He's been loitering around a lot these past few weeks, though — I thought maybe he'd come into some Mora.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 18.ogg Shitou: Competition is fierce these days, and there's not a lot of Mora to be made in shipping. So every day he stays idle is another negative day in the books... I do wonder what's gotten into him.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 19.ogg Shitou: Anyway, I digress! We merchants protect our goods like our own lives, so who knows — maybe he had some important cargo to see to... Either way, good Sir, don't mind him.
 Kaeya's a good knight.
 Kaeya is a kind soul.
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: Hehe, I am an upstanding member of the Knights of Favonius, after all. Just look me in the eyes. Don't you find me trustworthy?
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 20.ogg Shitou: Since you asked about recommendations earlier... You're here from Mondstadt, yes? Might I suggest the Tea House as somewhere to rest your legs?
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 shitou 21.ogg Shitou: If memory serves, they're just about to retell The Tale of Bravebeard, The Valiant from the top. Why not pay them a visit?
Media:vo kycop001 1908003 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: Huh, sounds interesting enough. Let's check it out.
Old Favors[]
(At the Heyu Tea House)
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: So this is the Heyu Tea House...
 Let's find some seats.
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 01.ogg Captain Wu: Ah... W—We meet again, Captain Kaeya.
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 02.ogg Captain Wu: What a coincidence! Twice in one day, hehe...
 Didn't you say you had something to do at the South Wharf?
 How are you already chilling at Heyu Tea House?
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 03.ogg Captain Wu: Oh... That didn't take me long. And I ran the whole way.
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 auntzhang 01.ogg Aunt Zhang: Eh? Wu, weren't you just at Wanwen Bookhouse buying a book for your daughter? What's this talk about the wharf?
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 guangzhi 01.ogg Guangzhi: Shh, just leave it be, Aunt Zhang. There's no need to embarrass him right in front of everyone else.
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 guangzhi 02.ogg Guangzhi: I take it that you two aren't from around these parts? I'm a caravan guard by trade, and meeting people from all over the world is one of the main perks of the job for me. Why don't you join my table, so we can get to know each other?
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Oho, seems like the Tea House is the place to be in Liyue. Feels like I'm back in the Angel's Share.
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Did you manage to get something for your daughter just now, Captain Wu?
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 04.ogg Captain Wu: Yes, thank you! If it weren't for you, Captain Kaeya, she might not even have made it into this world.
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 auntzhang 02.ogg Aunt Zhang: I'm so lost, Wu... What's the story here?
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 05.ogg Captain Wu: ...*sigh*
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 guangzhi 03.ogg Guangzhi: Your wife's originally from Mondstadt, isn't she? Did you run into Captain Kaeya when you were there on business? Or when you were visiting the in-laws?
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 06.ogg Captain Wu: *sigh* ...The latter.
 So wait, you two have met more than once?
 So wait, Kaeya's saved you more than once?
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 07.ogg Captain Wu: Oh, this is so humiliating... Anyway, back when my wife was pregnant, we were taking a trip to Mondstadt to visit her parents this one time, when we were mugged by a group of Treasure Hoarders near Dawn Winery.
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 auntzhang 03.ogg Aunt Zhang: Oof, that sounds awful... Were either of you hurt?
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 guangzhi 04.ogg Guangzhi: I mean, he's still here, and he's still got all his limbs, so they can't have roughed 'em up too bad... I'm guessing Captain Kaeya stepped in before they could do either of you any serious harm, huh?
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 08.ogg Captain Wu: Yes, he did. Thankfully, he heard my wife crying for help, and drove them away.
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 09.ogg Captain Wu: My wife was injured and quite shaken up by the ordeal, so he took her to the winery, and asked them to look after her.
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 auntzhang 04.ogg Aunt Zhang: Eh? So what happened to you? Where did you disappear to?
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 10.ogg Captain Wu: I... I was in the water...
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 guangzhi 05.ogg Guangzhi: Huh? What did you jump in the water for? You know they can still get you in there, right...?
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 11.ogg Captain Wu: No, that's not— I didn't... Th—They threw me into the water. And, uh, stripped me of all my clothes...
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 auntzhang 05.ogg Aunt Zhang: They did what? Did they have a weird fetish, or something? Stripping a sailor naked and throwing him into the water... It's not like you were going to drown. So then what? I take it you swam to shore?
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: The Treasure Hoarders always move in groups, and fighting back when you're outnumbered isn't usually an option. It's no surprise that they quickly overpowered Captain Wu... I'm just glad that everyone made it out alright at the end.
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 12.ogg Captain Wu: Captain Kaeya! Please, there's no need for you to try to save face for me like this. I already owe you so much... You don't have to do anything more.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 01.ogg Captain Wu: Yet despite that, I somehow only ended up humiliating myself further... *sigh* There's no point in me trying to save face now.
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 13.ogg Captain Wu: They tossed me into the water to humiliate me, and to use it as leverage to get my wife to pay up. But they didn't know that I could swim...
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 14.ogg Captain Wu: What I'd intended was to pretend to drown, then sneak back onto shore while they weren't looking, and find a way to rescue my wife...
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 15.ogg Captain Wu: That was before Captain Kaeya appeared out of nowhere and saved the day. So then, I figured I'd get out of the water, get dressed, and catch up with you...
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 16.ogg Captain Wu: But god knows what they did with my clothes — I couldn't find them anywhere! By the time I gave up looking for them, you were most of the way to the Winery, so I had to run after you with nary a thing on myself...
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 auntzhang 06.ogg Aunt Zhang: Outrageous...
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 guangzhi 06.ogg Guangzhi: So, uh... what happened next?
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 17.ogg Captain Wu: I made it to the Winery, but the maids noticed me first... And they called the lord of the manor out to give me the beating the Treasure Hoarders never got around to...
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 18.ogg Captain Wu: After my wife recovered consciousness, she had to have a long talk with the young lord to explain everything. He then escorted us both safely to Stone Gate...
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 auntzhang 07.ogg Aunt Zhang: Pffhahaha, oh Wu, I'm sorry, but... Hahahaha...
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 guangzhi 07.ogg Guangzhi: Yeesh... Good luck living that one down...
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 19.ogg Captain Wu: Trust me, I know. My wife never lets me forget. *sigh*...
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: ...I'm sorry, Captain. I wasn't intending to share that story.
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 20.ogg Captain Wu: It's fine, it's my own fault for thinking I could sweep it under the carpet and forget about it. I don't know if I can ever repay you for all you've done... That's why I get so embarrassed every time I run into you.
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 21.ogg Captain Wu: Still, it won't stop me from trying. You and your friend are here to catch the storyteller, right? The tea's on me — it's the least I can do.
Media:vo kycop001 1908004 captainwu 22.ogg Captain Wu: In fact... They do serve some food here, too, but it's not the best. Okay, let me run and get some fruit to share... I'll be right back.
(Talk to Guangzhi)
Media:vo kycop001 1908011 guangzhi 01.ogg Guangzhi: I wonder how much Fan Er'ye caught of that... Old Wu really has no filter, does he...
(Talk to Aunt Zhang)
Media:vo kycop001 1908012 auntzhang 01.ogg Aunt Zhang: Ah, poor Wu, hahaha... Oh gosh, I'm so sorry, it's just... Pfft...
(Talk to Kaeya)
Media:vo kycop001 1908013 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: He really didn't have to share all the details of that story, but since he didn't seem to mind, I wasn't about to stop him...
 Did you forget about what had happened to him?
 Did you avoid bringing up the whole story on purpose?
Media:vo kycop001 1908013 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: I did actually forget at first. But once he brought up his daughter, the memory of his naked escapades came flooding back.
Media:vo kycop001 1908013 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Diluc thought some pervert was harassing the maids. He charged straight out of the door, greatsword in hand and raring to go... I haven't seen him so angry in a long time, ahahaha.
Media:vo kycop001 1908013 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: ...Ah. So many people owe me favors nowadays, it's hard to keep track of them all. I really should go check my favors ledger once I'm back and refresh my memory.
 You have a favors ledger?
 That's... alarming...
Media:vo kycop001 1908013 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Hey, you didn't think I was being serious, did you? Do I really strike you as the kind of person to keep track of favors in a notebook?
Media:vo kycop001 1908013 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: I just helped the guy out on a couple of occasions because I happened to be in the right place at the right time. I have no intention of asking him to do anything for me in return. At least... not so far.
(Talk to Kaeya again, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1908013 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Hey, you didn't think I was being serious, did you? Do I really strike you as the kind of person to keep track of favors in a notebook?
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 02a.ogg Captain Wu: I'm back with fruit! Please help yourselves, everyone. My treat.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Thank you.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 03.ogg Captain Wu: Don't mention it. It's just a few fruits, nothing extravagant.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 04.ogg Captain Wu: Once my new pharmaceutical business takes off and I have Mora to spare, I'll get you a proper thank-you gift and send it to the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 guangzhi 01.ogg Guangzhi: Pharmaceutical business? So you've found a new career? No more shipping?
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 05.ogg Captain Wu: Shipping's impossible work nowadays. There's too much competition, and the margins are too small, so I've decided to switch gears.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 06.ogg Captain Wu: I'm going to become a partner of Bubu Pharmacy, and provide funding for a brand-new medication they're producing.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 07.ogg Captain Wu: It's specially formulated to treat seasonal joint and limb pain. If you didn't know, it's a very common health complaint among sailors, but also extremely difficult to treat.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 08.ogg Captain Wu: I've suffered from it myself, which is why I know that a lot of people stand to benefit from this once it enters the market.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 09.ogg Captain Wu: It's a good cause, and a stable source of income. Whichever way you look at it, it's a step up from the back-breaking work I did before. I've already had some talks, and invested one million Mora for the first round of funding.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 auntzhang 01.ogg Aunt Zhang: That's impressive, Wu. I wouldn't have thought you had the connections for something like that. So is it Dr. Baizhu that you're in talks with?
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 10.ogg Captain Wu: Oh no, not Dr. Baizhu. Actually, it was his master, Dr. Baifuzi. His medical expertise and clinical experience are second to none, and he really cares about his patients.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 11.ogg Captain Wu: He gave me a few of his Traditionally Formulated Bone-Strengthening Pills when he saw me suffering from my leg pains one day. It was like a miracle cure — the pain immediately went away!
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 guangzhi 02.ogg Guangzhi: Dr. Baizhu's... master?
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 12.ogg Captain Wu: Yeah. I told him I'd be enthusiastically recommending his medicine to the other guys at the docks, and after some hesitation, he just went right ahead and wrote up a prescription for me, completely for free.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 13.ogg Captain Wu: He said that he shouldn't really be handing out free prescriptions since, and I quote, "it goes against generations of tradition handed down by our forebears." But he just felt like it was the right thing to do... What a great guy.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 guangzhi 03.ogg Guangzhi: Uh... But I got chatting with Dr. Baizhu recently when the Secure Transport Agency did a delivery for Bubu Pharmacy... He told me that his master has already passed away...
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 14.ogg Captain Wu: Huh!? Why would he say something like that? I mean, the guy's old, but he's still in great health.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Captain Wu... where did you meet this old master?
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 15.ogg Captain Wu: Uhh... just out on the street. I know that sounds dubious, but this is an educated and respectable gentleman we're talking about. There's no faking that.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: ...
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 auntzhang 02.ogg Aunt Zhang: Hold on a second, I've just remembered something. My nephew-in-law met a medicine seller not too long ago too. He also described it as a miracle cure.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 auntzhang 03.ogg Aunt Zhang: He spent a lot of Mora on it, but when he brought it to Bubu Pharmacy, Herbalist Gui took one look and told him he'd bought nothing but regular painkillers.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 auntzhang 04.ogg Aunt Zhang: This Baifuzi you met — did he by any chance have a goatee and salt-and-pepper hair?
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 16.ogg Captain Wu: He did...
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: If I may, Captain Wu. There's a lot of Mora involved here. It seems like it would be worth asking this Dr. Baizhu about his master, just to set the record straight. You could show him the medicine as well. Clearly there's some misunderstanding here.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 17.ogg Captain Wu: You're right, Captain Kaeya. A quick trip to Bubu Pharmacy, and I can get Dr. Baizhu to clear all of this up. I'm sure it's all... I mean, hopefully it's all... fine...
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 guangzhi 04.ogg Guangzhi: He left in a hurry... He must be stressed out of his mind right now.
 Should we go with him for moral support?
 I know Dr. Baizhu! Maybe I should go and help...
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Hey, let him deal with this, okay? No point in you stressing yourself out too. Fraud or not, it's up to Captain Wu to figure out exactly who he's gotten himself involved with.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: I'm no Darknight Hero — or martial arts hero, for that matter. And neither are you.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Wait... Or are you? Now that I think about it, I can see you having a secret double-life as a martial arts hero in Liyue... You certainly have the personality for it.
 ...
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Either way, Liyue has its own rules and regulations. Best to let the Ministry of Civil Affairs deal with this in the proper manner. If a couple of outlanders like us get involved, we might just end up muddying the waters — even with the best of intentions.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: We came here to enjoy ourselves, remember? We don't want to get our priorities mixed up. Oh, and look at that, the storyteller's taking the stage.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 teamasterliusu 01.ogg Tea Master Liu Su: It is said that the sky's the limit for the aspirational soul, but alas, for the woes of the world are equally limitless. No such stranger to woes was Huanguang, a man who, having suffered countless injustices at the hands of his fellow men, forsook them to dwell among the mountains and rivers.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 teamasterliusu 02.ogg Tea Master Liu Su: Yet fate fortuitous found him when he entered the tutelage of an adeptus, and learned many mystical arts from them. Per his master's wishes, he then returned once more to the human world — only this time, with a sworn duty to cleanse the land of demons, and to see justice done wherever he might tread...
You listen to The Tale of Bravebeard, the Valiant.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: Is that all? Aw, I was hoping to hear the rest of the story.
 Did you like the storyteller?
 What did you think of the story?
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: It was alright. I suppose the hero always has to sacrifice himself to save others, and it does make for some good storytelling. But it leaves you wondering how he really feels about the whole thing. Did he ever have second thoughts? Only he can know, I suppose.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 18.ogg Captain Wu: Ah, I see the show is over.
 Did you find Baizhu?
 Were you defrauded?
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 19.ogg Captain Wu: Yeah, I saw Dr. Baizhu... Looks like it was a scam after all.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 auntzhang 05.ogg Aunt Zhang: Then what are you waiting for? Don't just stand there! You need to report this to the Ministry of Civil Affairs right away!
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Hold on, let's not lose our cool. Get your story straight first, so you can give them a clear and detailed account of events in the order that they occurred. And one more thing... Do you still have a way to contact this guy?
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 20.ogg Captain Wu: Well, I'd arranged to meet him at the Yanshang Teahouse once I've withdrawn the next sum of Mora... So I suppose he'll still be waiting on that.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: Okay, so you've got another meeting lined up... Hmm...
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 21.ogg Captain Wu: ...Ugh, I've got no one to blame but myself for this... I can't believe I was so gullible. I guess the world isn't made for naive simpletons like me.
 Don't say that. This is not your fault.
 Your good nature is nothing to be ashamed of.
 The way he abused your trust is despicable.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 22a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 22b.ogg Captain Wu: (‍Young manYoung manText for male Traveler/Young ladyYoung ladyText for female Traveler‍), you're a good person, and I'm touched by your words of comfort. Still, it's up to me to find a way to get my Mora back.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 23.ogg Captain Wu: The consequences are mine alone to bear. Hah, at my age, I'm sure I should be comforting the young with words of wisdom rather than the other way around... What does that say about how I've spent my life...
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: Hmm...
 What is it, Kaeya? Got a solution?
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: It's obvious, isn't it? He needs to report the case to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
 But I want to help.
 There must be more we can do.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: ...Come with me.
(Talk to Aunt Zhang, Guangzhi, or Captain Wu, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 auntzhang 06.ogg Aunt Zhang: That con-artist is human scum!
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 guangzhi 05.ogg Guangzhi: Don't worry, Wu. We'll come with you to the Ministry to report the case.
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 captainwu 24.ogg Captain Wu: Surely I'll be able to get my Mora back... probably... hopefully...
(Talk to Tea Master Liu Su, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1908005 teamasterliusu 03.ogg Tea Master Liu Su: O woe is him, the hero that perishes before his time. O woe is his children, whose hearts will forever mourn his passing... But what will become of Bravebeard's younger sister, you ask? Till next time, dear listeners... All will be revealed in the next chapter.
(Talk to Kaeya)
Media:vo kycop001 1908017 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: I am quite curious. How does our chivalrous martial arts hero intend to come to Captain Wu's rescue here?
Media:vo kycop001 1908017 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: There are countless victims of injustice in the world. We can't try to help each and every one of them, can we?
 But you're a good person, Kaeya.
 Right now, we can at least help one person.
Media:vo kycop001 1908017 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Oho, I'm surprised. I didn't know you thought of me as someone who helps other people unconditionally.
Media:vo kycop001 1908017 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: I'm genuinely flattered, but we both know that I'm not that kind of person really.
 You didn't want others to laugh at Captain Wu's woes.
 And that's why I believe you'd be willing to help.
 You helped Captain Wu just because you were there, and you didn't even remember it.
 And that's why I believe you'd be willing to help.
 You even helped him think through where we can find the con-artist.
 And that's why I believe you'd be willing to help.
Media:vo kycop001 1908017 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Your logic is very straightforward... and quite endearing in its simplicity.
Media:vo kycop001 1908017 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: But I like how you think. So I'll indulge your martial arts hero aspirations for now.
(Talk to Captain Wu)
Media:vo kycop001 1908018 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Captain Wu, how would you feel about owing me one more favor?
Media:vo kycop001 1908018 captainwu 01.ogg Captain Wu: I'm sorry, Captain Kaeya?
Media:vo kycop001 1908018 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Let's say, hypothetically speaking, I found a way to recover your Mora that would leave the man who defrauded you feeling angry and frustrated, but give him no way to get back at you...
Media:vo kycop001 1908018 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: If it could be done, and the only cost was owing me yet another favor — what would you say?
Media:vo kycop001 1908018 captainwu 02.ogg Captain Wu: What exactly are you getting at?
Media:vo kycop001 1908018 kaeya 04a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1908018 kaeya 04b.ogg Kaeya: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) here is adamant that you should ask me for another favor. Personally, I blame the storyteller. After the inspiring tale of Bravebeard, (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍)'s all gung ho about playing hero, and righting this injustice once and for all.
Media:vo kycop001 1908018 captainwu 03a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1908018 captainwu 03b.ogg Captain Wu: Captain Kaeya, (‍young manyoung manText for male Traveler/young ladyyoung ladyText for female Traveler‍), I... Thank you. I will humbly accept your kindness.
Media:vo kycop001 1908018 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Alright. Now, here's what I'm thinking...
You develop a plan with Kaeya.
Media:vo kycop001 1908018 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Alright, then it's settled. Per our brave hero's plan, let's rendezvous at Yanshang Teahouse tomorrow.
(Talk to Guangzhi or Aunt Zhang again, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1908018 guangzhi 01.ogg Guangzhi: Don't worry. You can count on us.
Media:vo kycop001 1908018 auntzhang 01.ogg Aunt Zhang: Absolutely. We're all neighbors here. Old Wu's problems are our problems too.
The Gamblers[]
(Approach Yansheng Teahouse)
Media:vo kycop001 1908016 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: You're here. Good. I'll head upstairs first, and you join me in a bit.
Media:vo kycop001 1908016 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: You've got nothing to worry about. As long as this lucky coin's in my hands, it'll do as it's told.
Media:vo kycop001 1908016 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Before I toss the coin, I'll get our guy to bet heads or tails. Then it's your turn to bet — now remember: If I touch my chin, you bet heads. If I touch my forehead, you go for tails.
 Got it.
Kaeya leaves.
Everyone is in position.
The plan is risky, but if anyone can pull it off, it's Kaeya.
Media:vo kycop001 1908016 chuyi 01.ogg Chuyi: Hello. Are you waiting for someone?
 Ah, sorry, I must have spaced out for a second there.
 I'll head up now.
Media:vo kycop001 1908016 chuyi 02.ogg Chuyi: As long as you follow the rules of the Tea House, you're welcome here. Please be our guest.
(Talk to Chuyi, optional)

(Talk to Captain Wu, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 captainwu 01.ogg Captain Wu: I know all I have to do is wait here, but... No, forget it. I can't get cold feet now. I'll trust you and Captain Kaeya!
(Talk to Aunt Zhang, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 auntzhang 01.ogg Aunt Zhang: This table's taken.
(Talk to Guangzhi, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 guangzhi 01.ogg Guangzhi: This table's taken.
(Approach Kaeya and Mr. Bai)
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: ...Hmm, from the way you describe it, Liyue does sound like an attractive place to settle. Perhaps I might have to make the move here after all.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: All that awaits me back in Mondstadt is a horde of insufferable sycophants... Truly tedious. Hmph, the reason I left home in the first place was because I was reluctant to simply live off my inheritance.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 01.ogg Mr. Bai: I understand. For one as ambitious as yourself, Mr. Rich, living off of the family fortune must feel like the dullest existence in the world...
(The Traveler walks over)
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Um, what are you doing? It's common courtesy to introduce yourself... Can't you see we got here first?
 Don't be so uptight. I'm just looking for a seat.
 The other tables are all taken. This was the only place left.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: They're running out of tables, huh? Looks like this location's getting too small for them... Very well, I'll make an exception for you this one time. Let's hope the tea, at least, won't disappoint me.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 02.ogg Mr. Bai: So, my friend, what's your name?
 (Kaeya and I discussed titles in advance...)
 I am an aspiring foreign disciple of the Guhua Clan.
 (I'm an aspiring foreign disciple of the Guhua Clan.)
 I am an aspiring foreign disciple of the Guhua Clan.
 (Kaeya is a young lord from a wealthy family.)
 I am an aspiring foreign disciple of the Guhua Clan.

Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Ugh, this tea is... Never mind.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Mr. Bai, this has been a most pleasant and insightful conversation. I consider it good fortune that I encountered such a refined gentleman as yourself so far from home. Please allow me to pay for the tea.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 03.ogg Mr. Bai: Hehe, yes, good fortune indeed. In that case, I must thank you for your generosity.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: You there, I'll get yours too.
 *nods*
 Far from home?
 Where are you originally from?
 ...Thanks.
 Far from home?
 Where are you originally from?
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Oh, you can't tell? My family's lived in Mondstadt for generations. I got bored sitting around at home, and decided to set off on a journey to expand my horizons.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: The sights of Liyue Harbor are rather spectacular. I've half a mind to buy a waterfront property here, so I can come vacationing every year.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: That would be quite nice. If the family would spare me a little loose change, I could even invest in an antique shop or two so I have something to do during the day...
 But waterfront properties are so expensive...
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: And? The point of life is to enjoy yourself. If something makes me happy, it's worth every Mora.
 Flaunting your wealth much? Show off...
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Flaunting? Come on, we're talking, twenty, thirty million tops, surely? Isn't that just pocket change?
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 04a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 04b.ogg Mr. Bai: Mr. Rich, just to clarify, that's quite a large sum of Mora as far as the common (‍manmanText for male Traveler/womanwomanText for female Traveler‍) is concerned. It's understandable that our friend over here feels out of (‍hishisText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) league.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: The name's Albert. Surname Rich, but only the servants in the house address me as Mr. Rich. Now that we're so well acquainted, Mr. Bai, please just call me Albert.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 05.ogg Mr. Bai: Hahaha, Albert does have a nice ring to it. It is my honor to become friends with someone of your... caliber.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: You flatter me. What say you to acting as my guide during my time in Liyue? I'll pay you handsomely, of course. Naturally, board and lodging would be included, and I could pay you in the region of 50 thousand Mora per day.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 06.ogg Mr. Bai: No need, my good friend, I shan't be so vulgar as to take your Mora. We're both men of character. The pleasure of your ongoing acquaintance shall be ample reward in itself.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 07.ogg Mr. Bai: To join a noble gentleman on his travels is a rare opportunity. Please, let me draft up an exact itinerary... I'll make sure to give you the experience of a lifetime.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: You there, you're welcome to join us if you want. Which clan did you say you were with? The... Hoo-Hah Clan, or something?
 It's the Guhua Clan...
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: Guhua, huh... Strange choice of name. Gotta say, I've been in Liyue for a while now. This is the first I'm hearing of them... I guess they're one of these obscure ones who keep to themselves.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 08.ogg Mr. Bai: Yes, well, there are many martial arts clans and factions in Liyue. It's only natural that you haven't become acquainted with all of them.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 17.ogg Kaeya: Ah, fair enough. Still, weird name. Bet they have some even weirder practices.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 18.ogg Kaeya: Seriously though, what kind of skills do you guys train, anyway? It's all for show, right? I saw some people performing a few tricks down at the wharf. Is it that kind of thing?
 The Guhua Clan is devoted to the teaching of martial arts.
 If you're comparing the Guhua Clan to street performers, we have nothing to talk about.
 I will take my leave now. I'll get my own check as well.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 19.ogg Kaeya: I already told the server to put it on my tab. Don't bother getting her to split the bill, it'll only complicate things.
 Our master teaches us not to accept free favors.
 I was merely passing by. Your generosity would be better served elsewhere.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 09a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 09b.ogg Mr. Bai: (‍Young manYoung manText for male Traveler/Young ladyYoung ladyText for female Traveler‍), there's no need to take things so seriously. Why don't you loosen up and enjoy the free drink?
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 20.ogg Kaeya: Are you trying to make a point by throwing my generosity back in my face? Alright then, what if I say your bill is mine, and don't let you pay?
 ...Wanna fight?
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 10.ogg Mr. Bai: Please, my friends, let's not get so worked up. Yanshang Teahouse is no venue for a duel. We'll all get escorted right out the door.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 11.ogg Mr. Bai: You young people have hot tempers, I understand that. But there's no need to come to blows over a few words taken to heart when there are far more diplomatic ways to resolve the dispute.
 Ugh... Okay, then how about we settle this with a coin toss?
 I'll foot my own bill if I win.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 21.ogg Kaeya: Did I hear that right? So you'll only pay for yourself if you win, but I'll get the check for the three of us if you lose... It's not that I care about the Mora — after all, I offered to pay for everyone's drinks in the first place.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 22.ogg Kaeya: No, what I find truly absurd is your refusal to play fair. I demand that you also pay for three if you win.
 What a load of hogwash.
 If I win the bet, you have to make a formal apology to the Guhua Clan.
 You insulted me first, and now you also want to dictate terms?
 If I win the bet, you have to make a formal apology to the Guhua Clan.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 23.ogg Kaeya: Hmph, fine, you can have your apology if you win. But on one condition: We'll do the best of three, and the winner pays for the table.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 12.ogg Mr. Bai: Well, as long as you're no longer raring to fight... Peace begets wealth, as the elders used to say...
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 24a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 24b.ogg Kaeya: Why don't you join us, Mr. Bai? Let's entertain this (‍guyguyText for male Traveler/galgalText for female Traveler‍) for a sec. We don't want (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) to think you're stingy.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 13.ogg Mr. Bai: Uh... But I wasn't even a part of your argument...
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 25.ogg Kaeya: What are you trying to say, Mr. Bai? Whose side are you on here?
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 14.ogg Mr. Bai: I... O—Of course I'm on...
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 26.ogg Kaeya: And anyway, it's no big deal if you win. It's just a few cups of tea, after all, so you can just take it from your fees as my guide.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 baiqiming 15.ogg Mr. Bai: Ugh... Alright then, I suppose it's not all that different from the dice gambling games I used to play in my youth. If it's just for a few drinks... you can count me in.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 27.ogg Kaeya: Alright, now we're talking. Okay, now that we've agreed on the rules, how should we do this coin toss? After all, a Mora coin looks the same on both sides.
 Easy. We can just borrow a pen from the counter to mark one side.
Media:vo kycop001 1908007 kaeya 28.ogg Kaeya: Well, that should be simple enough. Here, I'll take this coin and ask the counter to draw a line on one side. You two can wait for me.

Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 02.ogg Mr. Bai: I, too, only met this Mondstadt millionaire by complete chance today, but we're getting along just fine. I actually came here to meet with a business partner, to count the cash from two recent investments, when this gentleman struck up a conversation with me.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 03.ogg Mr. Bai: In the real world, you've got to keep up appearances. There's no need to offend the rich. After all, if you keep them happy, you can probably make some Mora off of them, too.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 04.ogg Mr. Bai: You young people are much too impulsive. It pays to keep a level head.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Just so we're clear, let's say the marked side is "heads" and the unmarked side is "tails." Everyone has to pick a side before the coin toss. Oh, and no takebacks.
 Sure.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: We should also take turns tossing the coin.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 05.ogg Mr. Bai: Sounds fair to me. Why don't you do the first toss, Albert?
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Alright, then I'll start us off. Here we... Wait, I nearly forgot to collect everyone's bets. Mr. Bai, heads or tails?
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 06.ogg Mr. Bai: Hmm... I suppose the choice is arbitrary, since it's a fifty-fifty chance... I'll go with tails.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Let me think... I'll also go with tails. What about you? Heads or tails?
 Heads.
 Tails.
Kaeya: ...
 (You remember that Kaeya touching his chin means heads) Heads.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 07.ogg Mr. Bai: Ugh, darn, I won... Lucky me, I guess...
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: I won as well. Guess there might be a formal apology in the cards after all.
 Hey, this is just the first toss...
 Let's keep going.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Hmm... I have a suggestion. If one of us loses twice in a row, they should get knocked out while the other two carry on playing to decide the winner. Otherwise, with three of us playing, it'll start to get difficult to keep track of who's won the most times.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: I flipped the coin last time, so why don't you go next? I don't want you blaming my coin-tossing skills if you guess wrong this turn. Here...
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 08.ogg Mr. Bai: Now just wait a second, my dear friends. Please let me do the second toss.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Oh? Anxious to take your turn, Mr. Bai?
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 09a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 09b.ogg Mr. Bai: You are both young, and I've already seen your short tempers for myself. If Albert loses this round and this (‍young manyoung manText for male Traveler/young ladyyoung ladyText for female Traveler‍) wins, you'll be tied, and before you know it, you'll be at each other's throats again...
 Please, he was the one at fault.
 (The plan was for Kaeya to pass the coin to me next...)
 (This isn't a part of our plan! What should we do...)
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 10.ogg Mr. Bai: Well, that's not my only consideration, either. You two may be too young to know this, but I've been around the block a few times... What's to say this isn't a trick coin, hmm?
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 11.ogg Mr. Bai: In dice games, people use all sorts of methods to rig the game. Some even fit the dice with mechanisms that give them whichever result they want.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 12a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 12b.ogg Mr. Bai: If Albert wins the next round and you, (‍young manyoung manText for male Traveler/young ladyyoung ladyText for female Traveler‍), lose for the second time in a row, then the third round will just be a tiebreaker between him and me, and you won't get your apology to the Guhua Clan.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 13.ogg Mr. Bai: If that happens, only for you to then find out that the coin was rigged all along, you're sure to accuse me of working with Albert to scam you while mocking the Guhua Clan... I can only imagine the kind of vengeful warpath that would put you on.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 14.ogg Mr. Bai: A purely hypothetical scenario, of course, but one that I'm bringing up now to avoid any misunderstanding further down the road. Go on, give me the coin. I'll show you how to check if it's been rigged.
 (Why is Kaeya still smiling...)
 (If he catches us out, we'll be in deep trouble...)
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Very diligent of you indeed, Mr. Bai. Looks like I chose the right person to be my guide. Here, take it.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 15.ogg Mr. Bai: A rigged coin will always be a little heavier than a normal coin, you see... This one seems perfectly normal to me, however. But don't take it from me, why don't you test it for yourself?
 No need.
 (Phew, that was a close call...)
 Pettiness is below me. I trust your judgment.
 (Phew, that was a close call...)
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: What's your bet this time, Mr. Bai?
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 16.ogg Mr. Bai: I'll stick with tails.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Tails, huh... Well, you seem to have a feel for this, so I guess I'll match your bet again this round. Tails it is. And you?
 Heads.
 Tails.
Kaeya: ...
 (You remember that Kaeya touching his chin means heads) Heads.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 17.ogg Mr. Bai: Hmm, well my luck's still just about holding out. The three of us are now tied, so no one drops out. Certainly better than Albert and I going head-to-head in the final round.
 My turn.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Mhm-mmm, well here you go. What'll it be, Mr. Bai?
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 18.ogg Mr. Bai: Hmm... It's a tough decision this time.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: Haha, that's what makes it fun, isn't it? Anyway, there's no need to stress. What's the cost of a few cups of tea compared to 50 thousand I'll be paying you every day?
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 19.ogg Mr. Bai: You make a good point. Alright, I'll take heads.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: Okay, and now it's my turn to guess... Not that the outcome matters either way to me. I won't even notice the Mora's gone... Whatever, I'll take tails.
 Tails.
 Heads.
Kaeya: ...
 (You remember that Kaeya touching his forehead means tails) Tails.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 20.ogg Mr. Bai: Ugh, why did it have to be heads? This whole thing started because you two got into a spat, and now I'm the one who has to foot the bill...
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 21.ogg Mr. Bai: Hmm... What say you to another round?
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: Sure, why not? I'm having fun. I can go for as many rounds as you want.
 I'm out.
 You guys have fun.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: Hah, what a miserly person. Do as you please, the two of us can play.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 22.ogg Mr. Bai: But Albert, all the fun of gambling is in the stakes involved. What say you to throwing a little loose change into the pot?
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 17.ogg Kaeya: Ah, come on now, no need to walk on eggshells here. Let's keep it simple, shall we? If you guess right, I pick up the tab. But if you guess wrong, I'm afraid it's still on you.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 23.ogg Mr. Bai: Sure, that's exactly what I was thinking.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 18.ogg Kaeya: Well, here's the coin. You can toss first. I'll take heads.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 24.ogg Mr. Bai: Hmm... I'll choose...
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 19.ogg Kaeya: Wouldn't it defeat the whole purpose of betting if you guessed the same as me? This is a two-person game now, surely one of us has to guess heads and the other tails?
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 25.ogg Mr. Bai: Alright, alright. It all comes down to luck after all. I'll take tails.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 26.ogg Mr. Bai: Ooh, looks like Rex Lapis has smiled upon me today after all. Thank you for the tea, Albert.
 You're on a lucky streak today.
 Bet you wished you'd raised the stakes now, huh?
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 20.ogg Kaeya: Heh, look at you, getting so giddy over some chump change. It's like you've never gambled with real money before, my old man... That's a real rush, I'm telling you. This is nothing by comparison... In fact, I'm starting to get a little bored...
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 27.ogg Mr. Bai: Well, um... In that case, would you care for another game?
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 21.ogg Kaeya: Sure, and let's up the stakes a little this time. Shall we say 50 thousand?
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 28.ogg Mr. Bai: Oh... Maybe that's a little on the high side...
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 22.ogg Kaeya: What, 50 thousand? But that's just a single day's guide pay for you.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 29.ogg Mr. Bai: ...Alright! I'll bet tails.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 23.ogg Kaeya: Great, then I'll bet heads. No takebacks.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 together 01.ogg Both: Heads (Tails)!
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 31.ogg Mr. Bai: Ohh... how unfortunate. I shouldn't have gotten greedy. After all, in the long run, gambling is always a losing game. 50 thousand Mora, my goodness...
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 32.ogg Mr. Bai: Albert, I'm terribly sorry but as it happens, I forgot to bring my coin purse with me today... Could you perhaps take this 50 thousand out of my guide fees? Call it an advance payment... That would make us even.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 24.ogg Kaeya: Advance payment? Sorry, I'm afraid that's not my style. It'll have to be cash.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 33.ogg Mr. Bai: Ah, this day's just getting better and better... Well, so be it. 50 thousand... let me see what cash I have on me...
Mr. Bai takes out fifty thousand in Mora bills from his bag.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 25.ogg Kaeya: Just fifty thousand? That's not what we agreed on.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 34.ogg Mr. Bai: Huh!? What are you talking about? I think you'll find that our bet was for 50 thousand!
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 26.ogg Kaeya: No, it wasn't. The amount was one million.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 35.ogg Mr. Bai: One million? Are you insane? Come on now, Albert, be serious. A million here and a million there might be all fun and games to you rich types, but to ordinary folk like myself, this is no laughing matter!
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 27.ogg Kaeya: I'm being perfectly serious. I know what I said, and what I said was one million Mora.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 36a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 36b.ogg Mr. Bai: You're lying through your teeth! Hey, (‍young manyoung manText for male Traveler/young ladyyoung ladyText for female Traveler‍), you tell him. Did you hear him say "one million" at any point during our bet?
 Yeah, he said one million.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 37.ogg Mr. Bai: Huh!? What the... I'm not deaf, you know! I swear I heard 50 thousand... Wait...
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 38.ogg Mr. Bai: Oh, I see... You two are in this together!
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 39.ogg Mr. Bai: I'd never met either of you before today, and out of nowhere you suddenly rope me into betting over a coin toss, and now you're accusing me of owing you one million Mora...
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 40.ogg Mr. Bai: Hah, do you have any idea who you're trying to cheat? I know all the tricks in the book... I can't believe a couple of beginners like you managed to get this far...
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 41.ogg Mr. Bai: Gah, well don't you try to celebrate just yet! You amateurs have a lot to learn about the art of the con!
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 42.ogg Mr. Bai: Do you really think that nobody else will have heard all the commotion we just made? All I need is one witness, and this little scheme of yours falls apart.
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 43.ogg Mr. Bai: Frauds, frauds I say! These two kids are trying to scam me out of my hard-earned Mora! Hostess! Oh, Hostess! Come quickly!
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 kaeya 28.ogg Kaeya: Tsk, how pathetic...
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 chuyi 01.ogg Chuyi: What is going on here? If you can't abide by our rules, you're not welcome at Yanshang Teahouse. I don't care what the issue is, you don't get to make a racket like that in here. Halberd, Fang...!
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 baiqiming 44.ogg Mr. Bai: Wait, wait, don't throw me out! These two con-artists are trying to steal my Mora. You can't let them get away with it!
Media:vo kycop001 1908020 chuyi 02.ogg Chuyi: Well, let's take this somewhere else. I don't want any of you disturbing the other guests.
(Approach the group)
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 chuyi 01.ogg Chuyi: Okay, you two. Care you explain yourselves?
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Gladly... He's making up completely spurious claims. We were betting Mora over a few coin tosses, and now he wants to back out — in the land of contracts, of all places.
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: He won 250 thousand from me, then another 800 thousand from the both of us. Now he's refusing to pay up the measly 50 thousand that he lost in the final round...
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 chuyi 02.ogg Chuyi: Okay, so after settling up, a total of one million Mora should have changed hands... Sounds plausible enough.
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 baiqiming 01.ogg Mr. Bai: It's a complete pack of lies! Hostess, if you don't believe me, ask anyone else in the tea house. These kids were so loud, I guarantee you everybody in that room knows the true story!
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 chuyi 03.ogg Chuyi: Sorry to interrupt you all, but you're witnesses to the situation here. Is what Mr. Bai says true?
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 auntzhang 01.ogg Aunt Zhang: Ah, thank goodness you're finally here, what took you so long? That old guy's been bragging about the Mora he's won so loudly I'm surprised the whole street didn't hear him. I was about to report him to the Ministry of Civil Affairs...
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 guangzhi 01.ogg Guangzhi: Leave me out of this, I want nothing to do with gamblers and scammers. Please just bring me my check.
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 chuyi 04.ogg Chuyi: Our new owner laid down the law not too long ago. We turn a blind eye towards casual games of dice, but there's zero tolerance for any explicit gambling with real Mora.
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 chuyi 05.ogg Chuyi: Return any winnings to the party you took them from, and we'll say that none of this ever happened. Otherwise, I'll have to bring in the Millelith — and I can assure you that they take a more hard-line on this kind of thing than we do.
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 baiqiming 02.ogg Mr. Bai: ...Why should I have to give them any Mora? I don't have any Mora on me!
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Oh, but I think you do. Two investments, was it? One of them to the tune of exactly one million, as it happens. Oh, and don't forget you still need to pay the tab.
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 baiqiming 03.ogg Mr. Bai: You... Wait, how did you...
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 chuyi 06.ogg Chuyi: Halberd, Fang! There's a gentleman here that I'd really like you to meet...
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 baiqiming 04.ogg Mr. Bai: Please, please don't! I'll pay, alright?
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: This was never your Mora to begin with. We'll be returning it to its rightful owner now.

(Talk to Chuyi again, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1908019 chuyi 07.ogg Chuyi: We can't have this discussion in front of the other customers. Please step outside.
(Talk to Captain Wu)
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: What did you think, Captain Wu? Could you hear clearly from your corner on the second floor?
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 captainwu 01.ogg Captain Wu: Yes, everything! I... I can't thank you two enough...
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 baiqiming 01.ogg Mr. Bai: Wu, this was your doing, wasn't it? You and the Mondstadter planned this whole thing!
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 baiqiming 02.ogg Mr. Bai: Along with that (‍blondblondText for male Traveler/blondeblondeText for female Traveler‍) one... And all the customers on that floor were in on it too, weren't they?
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 baiqiming 03.ogg Mr. Bai: ...I know where you live. And I know what your wife looks like, and your pretty little daughter too. You crossed the wrong man today!
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 captainwu 02.ogg Captain Wu: Wh—Who'd be scared of a crook like you? I'll take you on, any day of the week!
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 baiqiming 04.ogg Mr. Bai: Hmph, well let's see how long that false bravado of yours will last.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Look at that, he figured it out. Guess he's not as dumb as we thought.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 baiqiming 05.ogg Mr. Bai: Don't you two get cocky, either. Just you wait, I will hunt you down!
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 chuyi 01.ogg Chuyi: My apologies for having to leave this question until you'd vacated the premises, but I couldn't have things escalate inside the teahouse. I hope you can understand our position.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 chuyi 02.ogg Chuyi: I noticed that all the guests on the second floor were present before you took your seats, then left almost immediately after you did.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 chuyi 03.ogg Chuyi: Would I be correct in saying you were looking to set this man up?
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 baiqiming 06.ogg Mr. Bai: Wait, so you saw through it right away!?
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 chuyi 04.ogg Chuyi: Under normal circumstances, we would never tolerate a scheme like this taking place on our grounds, as it risks damaging our owner's reputation.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 chuyi 05.ogg Chuyi: However, I understand that our owner holds (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) in high regard, and must have good reasons for their actions. Still, I would appreciate an explanation, if only so that I can answer to the owner.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Ah, as I thought... When you're operating on someone else's turf, you run the risk of clashing with the master of the house... Thankfully, we considered that possibility before going ahead with our plan.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Over to you, brave hero (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). You're the one with connections in Liyue — it's your time to shine.
You recount what happened to Captain Wu.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 chuyi 06.ogg Chuyi: Okay, I understand the situation now. It goes without saying that I have no wish to stand in the way of your chivalrous deeds. I'll report everything you told me to our owner.
 Feel free to find me again if you need any further explanation.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Well, Captain Wu, remember what I promised you? What do you think — angry and frustrated enough for you?
 I think you delivered.
 Shame he didn't cry like a big baby, though.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 jiayi 01.ogg Jiayi: Excuse me, coming through. Is this the Mr. Bai you reported to us?
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 guangzhi 01.ogg Guangzhi: Yes, that's him alright! The one who scammed Captain Wu.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 baiqiming 07.ogg Mr. Bai: ...W—Wait, wait! Where's your evidence, hmm? And Wu, you've already recovered your Mora. I don't deserve to be punished twice for the same crime!
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 jiayi 02.ogg Jiayi: You can't talk your way out of this one. You're already suspected of defrauding multiple victims out of smaller amounts, and the combined total meets the threshold for a conviction. If it turns out you're guilty in this case too, it'll only add to your sentence.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 jiayi 03.ogg Jiayi: Does the plaintiff have any witnesses? If so, we'd really appreciate if they could come with us and provide a testimony.
 Here, Sir. I'm happy to give a testimony.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 jiayi 04.ogg Jiayi: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), You got tangled up in this too, huh?
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 jiayi 05.ogg Jiayi: In that case, please come with me. Your witness statements will play a crucial role in helping to move this case forward.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 jiayi 06.ogg Jiayi: Don't worry, we won't take up too much of your time. ...And you, Sir, can stop twiddling your thumbs — you're coming with us too.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 baiqiming 08.ogg Mr. Bai: Hey, keep your hands off me, I'll cooperate. I'll cooperate! Stop manhandling me, wahhh...!
The Millelith takes the conman away. You give a testimony, then return to the teahouse entrance.
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 captainwu 03a.ogg Captain Wu: Thank you so, so much, the both of you. I really don't know how I could ever begin to repay you...
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Well, I have an idea. We originally came here to do some sightseeing... Anywhere you'd recommend we go before the end of our trip?
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 captainwu 04.ogg Captain Wu: Let me think, now where would I want to go... Hey, are either of you interested in a fishing trip?
Media:vo kycop001 1908008 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Sounds fun to me. Let's go.
(At the docks)
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Well, this was certainly an eventful end to my trip. It wouldn't have been possible without you... or my lucky coin, of course.
 I'm just glad that nothing went wrong when I tossed the coin.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Haha, wouldn't be much of a lucky coin if it had. Besides, I already taught you how to become attuned to it.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: You still need some practice to master the technique, but luckily it decided to play nice, and spare us any more complications.
 How do you control it, anyway?
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Mm, a better question to ask might be, what do I do to make this coin happy to work with me, and show me whichever side I wish?
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: My answer would be that I tell the coin a joke every time I toss it into the air. If it finds my joke funny, then it cooperates with me.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Of course, this whole arrangement hinges on a preexisting amount of trust between the two of us. I can't just get any strange coins to listen to me.
 He caught us off guard when he insisted on taking the second coin toss.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Yeah, I was a little surprised when he unwittingly called out our trick coin... But it didn't matter.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: A good gambler always keeps their options open. You have to have a contingency plan for when the odds are against you.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: So when I went to the counter, I marked a regular coin as well as my trick one.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: That safely avoided any risk of him finding out about the trick coin. But it also meant that we wouldn't be able to control the result of that round.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: But hey, what does it matter? The fact that he made things a little more challenging only made it all the more exciting to watch him slowly but surely fall into our trap.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Especially listening to him warn us about the possibility of a rigged coin, right as we were scamming him. That was my favorite part.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: As long as I chose the same bet as him, and you bet the opposite to me, it was always going to end up with him paying. Unless, of course, he'd had some other tricks up his sleeve that we hadn't thought of...
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: ...Hehe, then things would have gotten really interesting.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 captainwu 01.ogg Captain Wu: You two are genuinely the smartest people I've ever met. I'm no intellectual, so I would never have been able to come up with a plan like this. Even when you described it to me, I only understood parts of it.
 Never change your good nature.
 All con artists get conned themselves sooner or later.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 captainwu 02.ogg Captain Wu: Well, I may not be the smartest guy around, but one thing I do know is this: One should always return tenfold the help that they've received from others.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 captainwu 03.ogg Captain Wu: We were just ordinary acquaintances. You had no reason to help me as much as you did...
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 captainwu 04.ogg Captain Wu: If there's anything I can ever do for you in the future, anything at all, please let me know. You can always count on me. I guarantee it.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: Oh? You seem agitated. Are you worried about owing me yet another favor?
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: Hehe, there are two kinds of people who owe me favors. One is my friends, and the other, my informants.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 17.ogg Kaeya: My informants have to fulfill whatever requests I make of them, no questions asked. The question is, which kind of person do you want to be?
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 captainwu 05.ogg Captain Wu: I...
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 18.ogg Kaeya: Ah, and you're torn again. Too afraid to ask to be my friend, but also daunted by the dangers inherent in becoming my informant.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 19.ogg Kaeya: Well, it's okay, because I just thought of a fun and easy way to get us out of this impasse. Let's do a coin toss.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 20.ogg Kaeya: This is the regular coin I prepared for the contingency plan when I was borrowing a pen from the bar. Not the lucky one that does what I tell it to.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 21.ogg Kaeya: If it's heads, we're friends. But if it's tails, you're at my beck and call... May the Lord of Geo decide.
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 captainwu 06.ogg Captain Wu: So... was it heads or tails?
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 kaeya 22.ogg Kaeya: What do you think? What does your heart tell you?
 Kaeya just put the coin back in his pocket...
Media:vo kycop001 1908009 captainwu 07.ogg Captain Wu: ...I understand now, you have my most sincere gratitude. Uh... ahem, no that's a little too formal. What I'm trying to say is... Here. Your fishing rods... my friends.

What the Kitties Like[]

(Talk to Diona)
Media:vo dancop001 1910201 diona 01.ogg Diona: Hmm, their tracks end here... looks like they ran off somewhere else.
 Then how do we find them?
Media:vo dancop001 1910201 diona 02.ogg Diona: Don't worry, those cats are very stubborn, but it's because they're stubborn that they're also easy to understand. Heh, I have another idea.
Media:vo dancop001 1910201 diona 03.ogg Diona: Let's pay a visit to Marjorie at With Wind Comes Glory. Roger broke his cat toy recently and I ordered him a new one there.
Media:vo dancop001 1910201 diona 04.ogg Diona: Maybe he snuck out because he didn't have anything to play with...
 Seems like you know him really well.
Media:vo dancop001 1910201 diona 05.ogg Diona: I—I only know these things because I want them to do their job and not mess around!
Media:vo dancop001 1910201 diona 06.ogg Diona: C'mon, let's head over to Marjorie's store.
(Talk to Diona by Marjorie)
Media:vo dancop001 1910202 marjorie 01.ogg Marjorie: Oh, hello Diona. You must be here for the cat toy you ordered? I just finished preparing it and made it extra durable according to your request. Your kitty should be able to play with this one for quite some time.
Media:vo dancop001 1910202 diona 01.ogg Diona: Much appreciated! Margaret will come and settle the fees later.
Media:vo dancop001 1910202 marjorie 02.ogg Marjorie: No problem! So, that cat named Roger... Is he usually at the Cat's Tail?
Media:vo dancop001 1910202 diona 02.ogg Diona: That's right, he's almost always in the tavern.
Media:vo dancop001 1910202 marjorie 03.ogg Marjorie: Wonderful! I'll definitely make some time to head to the tavern and play with him.
Media:vo dancop001 1910202 diona 03.ogg Diona: Oh, I see... Well, you're welcome to visit anytime.
Media:vo dancop001 1910202 marjorie 04.ogg Marjorie: I gotta say, you're awfully particular when it comes to take care of that cat. Hehe, you even provided me a list of materials to use for his cat toy.
Media:vo dancop001 1910202 diona 04.ogg Diona: That's just because Roger tends to get excited whenever he plays with the customers. He always ends up ruining his toy. This time we needed to make it more durable so that it would last longer.
Media:vo dancop001 1910202 diona 05.ogg Diona: He usually just lounges on the cabinets when no one's around...
 Maybe he just needs someone to play with?
Media:vo dancop001 1910202 diona 06.ogg Diona: You really think so? Hmph, I'm not interested in figuring out what those cats are thinking. They're just stubborn, that's how all cats are.
Media:vo dancop001 1910202 diona 07.ogg Diona: Let's head over to see Sara at Good Hunter, she always makes Nelson's cat food.
Media:vo dancop001 1910202 diona 08.ogg Diona: He's the one that always eats the most. And even though he's always eating, he somehow weighs the lightest. I really have no idea what he's up to all the time...
(Obtain Cat Toy ×1)
(Talk to Diona by Sara)
Media:vo dancop001 1910203 sara 01.ogg Sara: Welcome to Good Hunter... Oh, hey Diona! How can I help you?
Media:vo dancop001 1910203 diona 01.ogg Diona: Hello Sara, I'd like some more of that cat food I bought last time.
Media:vo dancop001 1910203 sara 02.ogg Sara: Oh, is my favorite kitty Nelson hungry again? Haha, hold on one moment, I'll have the kitchen prepare it for you.
Sara orders the kitchen to make cat food...

Media:vo dancop001 1910203 sara 03.ogg Sara: Alright, here's the cat food. It hardly takes any ingredients to make, so it's on the house!
Media:vo dancop001 1910203 sara 04.ogg Sara: But please, if you can bring Nelson with you next time... Everyone wants to pet him!
Media:vo dancop001 1910203 diona 02.ogg Diona: Sure, I—I'll see if he wants to come.
 You think cat food will do the trick?
Media:vo dancop001 1910203 diona 03.ogg Diona: Nelson's not usually very fond of people, but as soon as he smells some Dried Fish, he'll do anything you say.
Media:vo dancop001 1910203 diona 04.ogg Diona: And once he starts eating, ugh, he doesn't ever stop, someone has to drag him away from the food... Kinda like the old drunks at the tavern.
Media:vo dancop001 1910203 diona 05.ogg Diona: But the amount of cat food isn't too much this time, so it'll be fine if he finishes it all.
Media:vo dancop001 1910203 diona 06.ogg Diona: Alright, we have all we need for now, let's go find Roger and Nelson. We'll deal with Paisley later.
Media:vo dancop001 1910203 diona 07.ogg Diona: Roger always likes to sit in high places. Huh... maybe we should go check the rooftops.
Media:vo dancop001 1910203 diona 08.ogg Diona: Do you know how to get on top of buildings here? If not, you can just wait down here and I'll take care of it.
 I'm an experienced climber.
 I climb all the time, it won't be a problem.
Media:vo dancop001 1910203 diona 09.ogg Diona: Really? You don't look like much of a climber, but if you say so. Let's go up and look for Roger together.
(Obtain Cat Food ×1)

To Catch a Kitten[]

(Finding Roger on the Rooftop)
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 01.ogg Diona: Wait, see that cat there? That's Roger! Oh, he really picked a high place to sit this time...
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 02.ogg Diona: But don't get too close. If we startle him, he might run away.
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 03.ogg Diona: Okay, remember all the things we prepared? Now's the time to make use of them.
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 04.ogg Diona: So do you remember what would be better for attracting Roger?
 Use the cat toy.
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 05.ogg Diona: Hey, you've got a pretty good memory. That's right, cat toys are Roger's favorite.
 Use the cat food.
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 06.ogg Diona: Cat food? Are you sure? Like I said, Roger would probably prefer the cat toy.
 Let's use the cat toy then...
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 07.ogg Diona: So you do remember. Well hurry up and take out the cat toy then.
 Let's use the cat food anyway.
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 08.ogg Diona: Hmph. Fine, have it your way.
Roger: (Roger doesn't seem to be interested in the cat food...)
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 09.ogg Diona: See? I told you it wouldn't work. Roger definitely would like the cat toy better. Now hurry up and get it out.
(−3 Hearts)
You use the cat toy to attract Roger...
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 10.ogg Diona: Wow, he let his guard down almost immediately. Looks like he was just waiting for someone to come play with him.
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 11.ogg Diona: That little rascal... He always looks so smug, but the moment he sees people, he suddenly becomes all loving and affectionate.
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 12.ogg Diona: No wonder the customers like him so much. The first thing they ask when they visit the tavern is if Roger is around... yeesh.
 Well, he is really cute after all.
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 13.ogg Diona: Yeah, that's the problem! Who cares about specialty drinks when you have these fluffy little kitties to play with, right?
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 14.ogg Diona: If you ask me, the tavern doesn't need any more new drinks to attract customers. Just get more cats and people will come!
 I think the customers visit the tavern primarily for your cocktails.
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 15.ogg Diona: Well, obviously! The Cat's Tail is a tavern after all. No matter how cute these little kitties are, they're only there to complement my cocktails.
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 16.ogg Diona: Alright, let's bring along Roger and go find Nelson.
Media:vo dancop001 1910204 diona 17.ogg Diona: Now Nelson likes places that are warm. In fact, the last time I went looking for him, I found him in the bush next to the blacksmith. So let's go look for him there.
(Finding Nelson behind the Blacksmith)
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 01.ogg Diona: Yup, I knew we'd find Nelson here... and he looks like he's about to fall asleep. Huh, could it really be more comfortable than in the tavern?
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 02.ogg Diona: Anyway, let's take out the things we've prepared. I'll let you choose which to give him.
 Use the cat food.
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 03.ogg Diona: That's right! Nelson loves eating this stuff, the cat food will definitely make him happy.
 Use the cat toy.
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 04.ogg Diona: Are you sure you want to use that? I'm pretty sure I told you what he likes before... Have you forgotten already?
 Let's use the cat food then...
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 05.ogg Diona: So you've finally remembered. Just hurry up and take out the cat food already.
 Let's use the cat toy anyway.
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 06.ogg Diona: *sigh* You really don't know how to make cats happy, do you? Fine, if you insist have it your way.
Nelson: (Nelson doesn't seem interested in the cat toy...)
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 07.ogg Diona: See? He didn't even glance at the cat toy.
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 08.ogg Diona: C'mon just hurry up and take out the cat food!
(−3 Hearts)
(If 0 Hearts left)
Hangout Event Ended: The cats seem unwilling to listen to you. Did you go about coaxing them the wrong way?
You use the cat food to attract Nelson...
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 09.ogg Diona: Don't the customers at the tavern already feed you enough? How can you still be so excited to see food all the time?
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 10.ogg Diona: Oh, and there you go snarfing everything down as always... Why do customers like you so much? They even fight over who gets to feed you!
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 11.ogg Diona: Are you just pretending to be hungry all the time just to get the customers to come take care of you?
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 12.ogg Diona: Hmph, what a cheeky little guy... No wonder customers completely forget about their drinks after seeing him.
 Maybe you should take a hint from him and do what he does?
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 13.ogg Diona: Take a hint... from him? Ha, forget it! We should probably just get more cats at the tavern, they seem to attract more customers than my drinks.
 Your specialty drinks attract lots of attention already.
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 14.ogg Diona: Of course! You should see the looks on those old drunks' faces when Nelson spills over their cocktails in the tavern.
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 15.ogg Diona: Go ahead, pick him up. He doesn't weigh much. I really have no idea how he stays so light...
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 16.ogg Diona: Alright, let's go find Paisley. He used to always sneak out to go to the Cathedral before, so let's start there.
 Does he like cat toys?
 Does he like cat food?
Media:vo dancop001 1910205 diona 17.ogg Diona: Nope... he doesn't like either of the things that Roger and Nelson like. I'll tell you more when we get there.
(Finding Paisley by the Cathedral)
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 01.ogg Diona: Aha, just where I thought I'd find you, Paisley.
 So what should we do now?
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 02.ogg Diona: We don't need to do anything. Paisley doesn't fancy anything special, he just does whatever he's in the mood for.
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 03.ogg Diona: To sum it up, he's just a self-centered little cat.
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 04.ogg Diona: Even back at the tavern, he hardly ever interacts with any customers. Usually he prefers to just play with the other kitties.
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 05.ogg Diona: But enough about Paisley, let's just take him and head back. I'll pick him up, he doesn't usually run away when I carry him in the tavern.
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 06.ogg Diona: Uhh, wait. You want to pick him up? I'm telling you, Paisley just ignores strangers.
 Meow, meow...
Paisley: (Paisley doesn't seem to be responding...)
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 07.ogg Diona: See? No response at all... Here, just let me do it.
 Alright, I'll leave him to you.
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 08.ogg Diona: Listen Paisley, just be good and stay there, okay?
Paisley: (Paisley lovingly walks over and rubs Diona...)
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 09.ogg Diona: Good kitty, ohh that'll do. Hmph, you really are pretty cute when you're being good...
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 10.ogg Diona: Hey! Why are you looking at me like that, huh!? He only listens to me because I feed him all the time, that's all.
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 11.ogg Diona: For some reason, many customers actually like his personality. Once Paisley bobbles his head at them, they all start looking like they'd be willing to buy him cat food for the rest of his life.
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 12.ogg Diona: If only we got a few more cats at the Cat's Tail, then I wouldn't need to spend all my time making drinks anymore. All I'd have to do is take care of the kitties and let the customers come and pet them.
 That actually might make more money...
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 13.ogg Diona: You agree as well? Ugh, fine! Once I get back I'll suggest getting a few more cats, and let them attract all the customers. My specialty drinks aren't what the customers are after anyway.
 No one would know about these cats if it weren't for your specialty drinks.
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 14.ogg Diona: Well, of course! If it weren't for the Mora my drinks bring in, how would we pay for their toys and food?

Branch 1[]

Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 15.ogg Diona: You know what? Just bring the cats back to the tavern. That's why you came in the first place, right? To see the cats. Hmph! I'll walk back myself.
 Why don't we just go back together?
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 16.ogg Diona: I have to hurry back and convince the tavern to hire a few more cats. They're the key to attracting the customers, after all.
Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 17.ogg Diona: Cocktails... Hmph! No need for those anymore!

Cats truly are... inscrutable creatures...

Branch 2[]

Media:vo dancop001 1910206 diona 18.ogg Diona: Roger, Nelson, and Paisley... Yep, we've found them all. Let's hurry and bring them back, otherwise they won't be able to work when the tavern opens tomorrow.

When the Cats Come Home[]

(Upon returning to The Cat's Tail)
Media:vo dancop001 1910207 margaret 01.ogg Margaret: Oh, it looks like the kitties are back, as well as our customer.
Media:vo dancop001 1910207 diona 01.ogg Diona: Hey! I'm not one of the cats!
 Diona does fit the theme of the tavern nicely.
Media:vo dancop001 1910207 margaret 02.ogg Margaret: Of course. In fact, Diona is our best bartender.
Media:vo dancop001 1910207 diona 02.ogg Diona: Hmph. Please don't misunderstand my work as a bartender here. It's actually the first step in my plan of bringing destruction to Mondstadt's alcohol industry.
Media:vo dancop001 1910207 diona 03.ogg Diona: You've seen the drunkards stumbling around the city, right?
Media:vo dancop001 1910207 diona 04.ogg Diona: No matter how well-dressed or honest of a person they actually are, once they start drinking, they become terrible people.
Media:vo dancop001 1910207 diona 05.ogg Diona: Nothing good comes of alcohol, it makes people foolish, lazy, and ugly. That's why I plan on making the most disgusting drink there ever was. Everyone will realize how terrible alcohol really is!
Media:vo dancop001 1910207 diona 06.ogg Diona: That way, Mondstadt will finally be rid of alcohol and freed from its snarling teeth.
 Quite the grand plan you have there...
Media:vo dancop001 1910207 diona 07.ogg Diona: Of course, and that's why I became a bartender in the first place, I must understand anything and everything there is to know about alcohol. This is the first step in my plan.
 Why didn't you just go to Angel's Share to work instead?
Media:vo dancop001 1910207 diona 08.ogg Diona: Angel's Share? Hmph! Dawn Winery is the root cause behind all the drunks stumbling around Mondstadt. I wouldn't go anywhere even remotely associated with them!
 But, everyone seems to really like the drinks you make...
Media:vo dancop001 1910207 diona 09.ogg Diona: I—I'm still experimenting! It's more difficult than you think to make the most disgusting drink the city has ever tasted!
Media:vo dancop001 1910207 diona 10.ogg Diona: Anyway, I'll find a way to make my diabolical cocktail and keep everyone away from alcohol. Hmph!
Media:vo dancop001 1910207 diona 11.ogg Diona: Although, I haven't discovered how yet, but I will!
Media:vo dancop001 1910207 diona 12.ogg Diona: Anyway, didn't you come all this way to just see the cats? Now that all three of them are back in the tavern, why don't you go inside and play with them?
Media:vo dancop001 1910207 diona 13.ogg Diona: Oh, and in return for all your help, I'll make a special drink just for you... non-alcoholic, of course.

 Quest DescriptionFor Collei's future and that of all Sumeru, Faruzan decides to start a certain class...

(Go to the entrance to the Akademiya)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 01.ogg Collei: I can't believe she rushed right in after we arrived. She's really headstrong... *sigh* How did things turn out like this?
 Did I end up giving her a bad idea?
 You seem quite scared of her.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 02.ogg Collei: No, not really. Madam Faruzan is a brilliant scholar — even Master thinks so. If she's really going to teach me how to read, it'll definitely be much better than me bashing my head against the wall.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 03.ogg Collei: It's just that she can get a bit TOO passionate sometimes. I don't know how to handle that.
 The way she treats you...
 ...Is completely different from how she treats researchers.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 04.ogg Collei: Maybe it's because she wants to take me in as a student?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 05.ogg Collei: It's just like that researcher said: the Akademiya has completely changed during the 100 years that Faruzan was gone.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 06.ogg Collei: I don't really get it, but it does seem like Haravatat's students aren't optimistic about the prospects of doing research with her.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 07.ogg Collei: Students who are interested in mechanisms and applications of the elements generally enroll in Kshahrewar and Spantamad.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 08.ogg Collei: Madam Faruzan also refuses to accept random students just to make up numbers. She still hasn't found a student she likes, even after all this time back.
 So she's a teacher with no students...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 09.ogg Collei: But she seems to like my attitude toward learning, so she often asks me if I'm willing to become her student.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 10.ogg Collei: Agh, it's because I'm a slow learner that I have no choice but to stay up late and study! Whenever she compliments me, I feel really guilty...
 So you're scared of her because...
 ...She keeps asking you to become her student?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 11.ogg Collei: It's not that... Madam Faruzan respects my choices. She hasn't been trying to persuade me, especially since she knows I need to rest and recuperate.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 12.ogg Collei: She sometimes brings food to Gandharva Ville for me, and each time, she says that Master can't find out...
 That sounds like something a grandmother might do for her granddaughter...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 13.ogg Collei: Now that you mention it, it does feel a bit like that. ...Do I really look that young?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Collei, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), thank you for waiting. The issue has been resolved.
 That was fast!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: I argued with the higher-ups and convinced them of the practicality and necessity of educating the general public.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: If I'm not mistaken, they're the students of my classmates' students. They're a lot less forceful than their predecessors, though. I'd say they caved rather quickly.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 14.ogg Collei: A—Amazing...
 (Were they convinced...)
 (...Or were they coerced?)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: It's just that we need to fill in every single page of the application. Tch, it's been a century, but the Akademiya is as picky as ever.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: Let's see now, what do we need to fill in... Course name, learning objectives, teaching methods, course materials... Hmm, I suppose we can fill in the course name last.
 Our learning objective is to teach people to read, right?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: That's a bit too general, I'd say. After all, this class's target audience isn't toddlers or children, but rather people who already know the basics of reading.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: As such, we'll need a more specific learning objective. How about... proficiency in reading and writing?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 15.ogg Collei: That's true! If we use children's teaching materials, we'll only end up wasting a lot of time on things that students would already know...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: And you have your job as a Forest Ranger, Collei. People who attend this course in the future are also likely to have life commitments. We need more effective teaching methods.
 So, other than teaching materials for children...
 ...What other learning methods does Collei use?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 16.ogg Collei: Hmm... Master always tells me that practice is the best way to learn. That's why I often ask him to help me find simple books to read.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: It must have been difficult to get books in Sumeru in recent years, no? Tighnari really went the extra mile for you.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: Expanding literacy is a capital notion. Now that the Akademiya is easing restrictions on the circulation of books, there should be more people who have become interested in reading. It's a great time to conduct this course.
 So we've got teaching methods sorted out.
 How do we choose our course materials, then?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: Hmm, so that's next on the list... I fear that I'm at a loss as to which books youngsters like nowadays. Would "The Legend of Antara" be too old of a story?
 If even a centenarian like you finds that tale old...
 How old is that story, exactly...?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: Hm, fair... Collei, what have you been reading lately?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 17.ogg Collei: Me...? I've been reading light novels from Inazuma. I heard that ever since we were allowed to sell books in Sumeru again, some people set up stalls at Treasures Street to sell light novels. I've been meaning to go there and check it out!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: Light novels? This is my first time hearing about such a thing, but I doubt I will procure suitable teaching materials from the House of Daena... Treasures Street it is!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 18.ogg Collei: W—Wait for us, Madam Faruzan!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917102 collei 19.ogg Collei: Gah, you wouldn't think someone as fast as her is over 100...! Let's pick up the pace and catch up to her!

(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Farruq, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917301 farrokh 01.ogg Farruq: (These folks had better be buying...)
(Go to the book vendors at Treasures Street)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: What a long and mildly ungrammatical title. And why is the cover so colorful?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 farrokh 01.ogg Farruq: Is this your first time seeing a light novel, ma'am? They're the most popular of books nowadays. Would you like me to recommend something?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: Fine. One shouldn't judge a book by its cover, after all. May we browse through the books here?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 farrokh 02.ogg Farruq: Of course. Why don't you try this one? It's "Outlander Brigade: When the Wind of Death Blew Towards the Blond Samurai"!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 collei 01.ogg Collei: Ah, I heard that this book's author describes action in vivid detail.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: Hmm... Now, I've only skimmed through a few pages, but it feels like it's all fight scenes. There are only subjects and predicates, and the syntax is a tad simple.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 collei 02.ogg Collei: S—Subjects? Predicates?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: The protagonist just ends up fighting in every scene with no proper build-up. Will anyone even enjoy a story that's only comprised of fights?
 There might be people out there who will.
 It's for readers who don't care about plot.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 farrokh 03.ogg Farruq: Uh, how about "The Good Thing About Being Reincarnated as a Hilichurl Is That I Only Need to Eat Sunsettias to Become Stronger"?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 collei 03.ogg Collei: A reincarnation isekai story? Those are pretty popular right now.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: "Isekai"? What in the world is that? Also, why does it become stronger by eating Sunsettias?
 Those are what we call "tropes."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: "Tropes"? Ah, those fictional rules used to push the plot forward, yes? They're definitely effective in achieving a distancing effect.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 collei 04.ogg Collei: Uh, sorry, what is this distancing effect?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: However, this book doesn't explain how reincarnation correlates to becoming stronger. Such an illogical rule will affect the coherence of the story. Will readers really accept this?
 There might be people out there who will.
 It's for readers who don't care much for logic.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 farrokh 04.ogg Farruq: H—How about this? I had to fight tooth and nail to get this in stock!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 collei 05.ogg Collei: Oh! That's the latest volume of "Onibudou"!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: Hmm? Now that's a rather normal title length. ...Oh, Collei, do you like this series?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 collei 06.ogg Collei: Y—Yes, but I—I don't like it THAT much! Ha ha...
 (She clearly recognized it as the latest volume with a single glance...)
 (Is she embarrassed to admit that she likes books like that?)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 collei 07.ogg Collei: Uh... Madam, are you going to use this series as teaching material?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: Let me see... The dialogue flows quite well, but there are too many phrases here that I don't recognize.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: "Third Eye of Perception," "Illusory Mirror," and so on. Are these terms that are tied to tropes?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 collei 08.ogg Collei: Haha, I also thought those names were strange when I was reading them...
 She was able to say those phrases in such a serious tone...
 I guess that's a language researcher from Haravatat for you...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: It's impossible to derive the meaning of these phrases in isolation. Also, their morphological properties are quite pedestrian, really.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: Or did the protagonist purposely create these strange names to disorient their foes?
 I think it's because such names are "cool"...
 I think it's because such names are "fancy"...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: So there's no deeper purpose? My, it's quite hard to understand stories written these days.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 collei 09.ogg Collei: Y—You're right... It's such a weird book, haha... but you keep wanting to read the next page...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 14.ogg Faruzan: *sigh* Even the most popular book in Sumeru back then had greater depth than anything written today.
 The most popular book back then?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 15.ogg Faruzan: Yes — a Vahumana researcher wrote it while researching folk legends.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 16.ogg Faruzan: The plot had many twists, the world-building was fantastic, and even the writing could withstand scrutiny. When it was still being published, many people in the Akademiya were reading it.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 17.ogg Faruzan: Even the sages back then all described the story as a timeless classic. The series must have concluded after so many years, right? Perhaps it's even more popular now.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 farrokh 05.ogg Farruq: Is there a book like that in Sumeru? I've never heard of such a thing before. What's the title?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 18.ogg Faruzan: It's called "Tales of Shahryar." Do you sell it here?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 farrokh 06.ogg Farruq: Tales of Shahryar? I don't think I've heard of that before. When was it published?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 19.ogg Faruzan: About 100 years ago...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 farrokh 07.ogg Farruq: 100 years ago? Are you pulling my leg? What sort of book can remain popular for 100 years?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 20.ogg Faruzan: "The Legend of Antara" is popular to this very day, isn't it? I just heard someone telling it a few days ago in a cafe.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 21.ogg Faruzan: If an old story like that is still being shared, then "Tales of Shahryar" must be even more popular.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 farrokh 08.ogg Farruq: Even if that is the case, I really don't carry that book here in my store...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 22.ogg Faruzan: What? Hmm, is that because of the Akademiya's strict control over books in recent years?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 23.ogg Faruzan: I can't believe they've allowed the people of Sumeru to become so uncivilized. How can they not know about the Tales of Shahryar?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 farrokh 09.ogg Farruq: Tales of Shahryar... Oh wait, I think I heard an antique seller on the other end of Treasures Street mention that name before.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 farrokh 10.ogg Farruq: I mean, it is a book from 100 years ago... Why don't you try asking for it there?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 24.ogg Faruzan: Tales of Shahryar is considered an antique now? How could the Akademiya have let such an excellent work of literature be forgotten like this?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 faruzan 25.ogg Faruzan: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), Collei, I'm going to get to the bottom of this. Let's meet at the antique seller's.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 collei 10.ogg Collei: Madam, wait! Oh no, this is bad...
 What's wrong?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 collei 11.ogg Collei: You asked me why I'm scared of Madam Faruzan, right? It's not because I don't know how to respond to her kindness...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 collei 12.ogg Collei: It's because I'm afraid of that ancient language she researches, because I can barely understand any of it. What if she uses ancient texts as teaching material!?
 That book's only 100 years old, Collei...
 I doubt this counts as a book written in an ancient language...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917103 collei 13.ogg Collei: Even so, what if researchers from 100 years ago liked to use ancient languages in their books? We've got to catch up to her!
(Talk to Farruq again, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 farrokh 01.ogg Farruq: A book that was popular 100 years ago? It doesn't sound like something that'd be popular now, to be frank.

(Go to the antique shop at Treasures Street)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Found it! The fifth volume of "Tales of Shahryar"!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 collei 01.ogg Collei: Wow, you actually found it!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 derafsh 01.ogg Derafsh: I never thought that this book would ever get sold...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: All right, that's our teaching material secured. We also now know what to call this course: "Analysis of Classical Texts." After all, this book is definitely worthy of being called a classic!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 collei 02.ogg Collei: C—Can I take a look...?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 collei 03.ogg Collei: Phew... Luckily, the language being used here isn't ancient at all. I can recognize a few words here and there... Huh? But why aren't there pictures in this book?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: As long as the writing is good, readers won't need any illustrations to imagine the scenes.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: Worry not, I shall thoroughly explain the difficult sections. You'll like this book, I know it!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: Ah, after all this time. I wonder if Aliyah and Aziz ended up together. And who obtained the Desert Gem in the end...?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: Sir, do you have the subsequent volumes of this series?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 derafsh 02.ogg Derafsh: Uh, I don't think so.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: Is that so? And here I thought I could finally read the ending... Never mind, I'll keep searching for the later volumes myself.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: If I'm to use it as a teaching material, it's better to start earlier in the series. Where are the first four volumes? Why aren't they all together?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 derafsh 03.ogg Derafsh: Uh, I don't have those either. Actually, this is the only volume I have.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: Is this series really that popular?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 derafsh 04.ogg Derafsh: No, no, no. It's not popular at all. Rather, there's absolutely no demand for it.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: No demand? Impossible! Back then, I'd come across at least three groups of people talking about it during a single stroll at the Akademiya!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 derafsh 05.ogg Derafsh: Seriously? No one told me that this book was anything special when I first got it.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: Where did you get this from? Can you still contact the seller?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 derafsh 06.ogg Derafsh: I'm afraid not. This book was sold together with a whole bunch of antique furniture. I didn't even notice it initially.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 derafsh 07.ogg Derafsh: Otherwise, the matra would've come knocking... Wait, is this book actually worth a lot? It can't be, right?
 I'm afraid not.
 It doesn't look valuable.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: That's impossible! No matter how strict the Akademiya was, there's no way "Tales of Shahryar" could have fallen into such a state...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 derafsh 08.ogg Derafsh: Ah, I do remember a passerby skimming through the book a few days ago. However, he simply sighed and left.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: He sighed? Why would he react like that? Given the quality of "Tales of Shahryar," he should've been entranced after a single glance.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 14.ogg Faruzan: ...I'm sorry, Traveler, Collei. Please give me a moment. I'd like to look through this book first.
Faruzan quickly flips through the pages...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 15.ogg Faruzan: ...Why is there another misunderstanding between Aliyah and Aziz? Also, why is there no mention of the Desert Gem at all?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 16.ogg Faruzan: ...And a new character is introduced with no foreshadowing at all? Also, what are all these new names and terms?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 17.ogg Faruzan: Is this really the "Tales of Shahryar" I know...?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 18.ogg Faruzan: *sigh*
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 derafsh 09.ogg Derafsh: Well, that passerby reacted in much the same way.
 Who was the passerby, in any case?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 derafsh 10.ogg Derafsh: It's Maddah from the cafe over there. You know, the fellow who spends all day telling "The Legend of Antara."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 derafsh 11.ogg Derafsh: Since that's also a very old story, maybe he knows a thing or two about that, uh... Tales of... uh, whatever it's called.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 collei 04.ogg Collei: Then let's go ask around at the cafe... Um, Madam Faruzan?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917104 faruzan 19.ogg Faruzan: ...Oh, yes... Let's go.
(Talk to Derafsh again, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 derafsh 01.ogg Derafsh: Anyway, is there anything else here that has caught your eye? As long as the price is reasonable, I can give you this book as a bonus!

Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 05.ogg Maddah: Huh? "Tales of Shahryar"? Why, I can barely remember the last time anyone talked about it.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 06.ogg Maddah: My master always talked about how incredibly popular that book used to be. However, I tried reciting a few chapters of it at the cafe, and I found that it's even less popular than "The Legend of Antara"...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: Your master?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 07.ogg Maddah: Yes, the one who taught me how to be a storyteller. He said that "Tales of Shahryar" was written by his master's master's master.

Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 09.ogg Maddah: He wrote four volumes back then, and the reviews just got better and better! You couldn't find a single person in Sumeru who hadn't read his books.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: And then? What happened next? Why doesn't anyone know about "Tales of Shahryar" now?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 10.ogg Maddah: Oh, it's hard to tell when it comes to trends. One day, everyone likes stories like that, and the next day, their tastes change completely.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 11.ogg Maddah: Instead of writing a proper ending, this great-great-grandmaster kept trying to extend the story...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 12.ogg Maddah: To tap into popular trends, he added a lot of tropes. Then, starting from the fifth volume, the reviews started to go downhill.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: How could that be...? Then, what happened to "Tales of Shahryar" in the end?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 13.ogg Maddah: In the end? There's no ending. The great-great-grandmaster tried to write a few more volumes, following whatever trends were popular at the time, but the trends kept changing right as he published his books.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 14.ogg Maddah: He got so infuriated that he stopped writing altogether and focused on his research instead.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: What...? So there's no ending? The readers didn't care?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 15.ogg Maddah: Haha, by that time, only a very small number of people were reading "Tales of Shahryar."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 16.ogg Maddah: Anyway, my master probably exaggerated. How could a work possibly have been that popular?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 17.ogg Maddah: The only tangible thing my great-great-grandmaster left is the original draft of "Legend of Antara."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 18.ogg Maddah: He also left behind many theses from his research phase. When my master talked about "Legend of Antara," he'd even quote from those theses.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 19.ogg Maddah: My master is a much better storyteller than me. Even when we're telling the same story about Antara, he's always able to draw in a huge crowd!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 20.ogg Maddah: But even he won't recite "Tales of Shahryar" due to its ever-changing writing style and its lack of an ending.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: So Antara's story is the one that lasted through the years...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 21.ogg Maddah: Well, not even sages can definitively ascertain the quality of something like a story. In the end, only time can separate the classics from the fads.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: Only time...?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 collei 04.ogg Collei: Madam Faruzan...?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: It's been a hundred years... Perhaps some things I once believed to be great aren't so after all.
 You know, I think...
 The story's decline might not have been due to changing trends...
 It doesn't matter if it's a classic or a fad. What matters is that you like it.
 You don't have to worry about that.
 The story's decline might not have been due to changing trends...
 It doesn't matter if it's a classic or a fad. What matters is that you like it.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 collei 05.ogg Collei: Y—Yeah! Master helped me find a lot of famous books at first, but in the end, I realized that I couldn't get into them...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 collei 06.ogg Collei: No matter how good those stories are, I can't improve my skills if I can't bring myself to read them in the first place. I think the best books for me are the ones I like!
 The problem here is not actually about improving your reading skills...
 ...But I suppose the principle is the same.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: ...Indeed.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: That is true. Readers' interests and trends of a time are not things that are so easily predicted.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: What was popular a hundred years ago could be completely forgotten in modern times. And yet a hundred years, as far as history is concerned, is but a blink of an eye.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: If "Tales of Shahryar" hadn't chased after trends and instead stuck to its original style from start to finish...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: It might have stood some chance of gaining renewed popularity... No, even if that didn't happen, at least it would be a work that was true to itself.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 collei 07.ogg Collei: Huh? Our conversation just got a lot more serious...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 22.ogg Maddah: I don't really get what you're talking about, but it does sound sensible. Looks like I also have to hang in there and tell Antara's story well!
 You should think about the present first.
 You should think about your income first.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 14.ogg Faruzan: Hah, how unseemly. I almost got carried away because of a single book. Well then, we should get back to the matter of our teaching material... It looks like we can't use "Tales of Shahryar" now.
 How about "The Legend of Antara," then?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 15.ogg Faruzan: No, it's much too old.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 23.ogg Maddah: Oh...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 16.ogg Faruzan: Collei, you found a book that you liked at the book stall, yes?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 collei 08.ogg Collei: Um... Yes, but I don't really—
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 17.ogg Faruzan: Then we'll use that book as our teaching material. Now that I think about it, using a book that you like is the most suitable choice for teaching you how to read.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 18.ogg Faruzan: As for the Akademiya... As long as we come up with an appropriate course name, we should be able to get away with this...
 I propose "Appreciation of Popular Literature."
 Perhaps "Analysis of Popular Literature" might do the trick?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 19.ogg Faruzan: My, it sounds like you've dealt with the Akademiya before! Let's go with that.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 20.ogg Faruzan: Now then, let's return to the book vendor in a bit and buy the latest volume of this "Onibudou" for Collei.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 21.ogg Faruzan: Ah, but if I wish to use it as teaching material, I have to read it first.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 collei 09.ogg Collei: Huh? Um... Uh...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 22.ogg Faruzan: Speaking of which, other than "Third Eye of Perception" and "Illusory Mirror," I also espy some unfamiliar phrases from the readers' messages at the back of the book.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 23.ogg Faruzan: Such things as "Even if it reminds me of my dark history, I still can't help but be drawn in by the story," and "The author has written all the things that I only dare whisper into a tree hollow!"...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 24.ogg Faruzan: Why do people use "dark history" to refer to awkward or embarrassing memories? Is this some slang that was invented in the last century?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 25.ogg Faruzan: If one of our learning objectives was researching linguistic changes over the past hundred years, it might make it easier to get these books approved as teaching material.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 24.ogg Maddah: Oh, I can tell you what that's all about! Apparently, in their youth, some people used to imagine themselves as someone "burdened by fate," "fighting against the world," et cetera.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 25.ogg Maddah: But as they grew older, they started to become embarrassed by such memories. Some would write those fantasies into novels, while others would entrust such tales to tree hollows...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 collei 10.ogg Collei: M—Maddah! You know, I suddenly have the urge to hear a story about Antara!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 faruzan 26.ogg Faruzan: Huh? Why so suddenly?
 I think we can ignore the whole dark history thing, just for now...
 It's good to reminisce on an old tale in a while.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917105 maddah 26.ogg Maddah: Heh, I knew it — there will always be people who love the golden oldies! Ahem. Now, let me tell you all about the ancient hero, Antara...

Qingce Village Treasure Hunt[]
 Step DescriptionThe Treasure Map that Beidou has acquired is hard to read indeed, but you give your opinion anyway. Now it's off to Qingce Village to help Beidou look for the treasure...

(Go to Qingce Village)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_grannyruoxin_01.ogg Granny Ruoxin: Ah, Beidou! Wow, and the Traveler... my goodness, what's the occasion? Just here to visit us old folks once again?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_grannyruoxin_02.ogg Granny Ruoxin: It hasn't been all that long since we last had a visit from The Crux.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_grannyruoxin_03.ogg Granny Ruoxin: But I'm glad you picked today. You're just the people I need. These two young rascals... they've been arguing with each other non-stop about some petty nonsense or other...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_grannyruoxin_04.ogg Granny Ruoxin: I'm too old to get through to them. They won't listen to me. Please, talk some sense into them!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: Rest assured, Granny Ruoxin. Whatever the situation is, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) and I will take care of it.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_wenjing_01.ogg Wenjing: Oh, thank goodness, it's Captain Beidou! You couldn't have come at a better time. You're the voice of reason I need in this situation!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_ji_01.ogg Ji: Captain, please! Help me get justice!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: Whoa! What exactly's going on here? Spit it out, tell me everything.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_wenjing_02.ogg Wenjing: It makes me mad just talking about it. Ji here — I don't know if he's got a screw loose or what his problem is, but anyway, he took it upon himself to raise, well, practically a whole army of finches, okay, and now guess what? They fly onto my land and completely destroy at least half of my crops!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_wenjing_03.ogg Wenjing: I asked him to pay compensation, but he refused. Now how is that fair?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_ji_02.ogg Ji: Captain, I'm innocent... they're not even my finches!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_ji_03.ogg Ji: I just thought they looked kinda cute, y'know, so I fed 'em a couple times... they're wild birds though!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_wenjing_04.ogg Wenjing: A couple times? Are you kidding me? That's rich. Really rich. There were two of them when you first started. Two finches. Now you have a whole roof full of finch nests.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_wenjing_05.ogg Wenjing: I swear every time I come by your place, I think I'm at a bird market. I'm telling you, you are not gonna get away with this anymore.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_ji_04.ogg Ji: So... yeah, I mean, they laid a few eggs, made a few nests... But finches gonna finch, y'know? These are wild birds, I mean, they'll do whatever they please...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: So that's how it is. I think I got the picture. Hmm...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), what's your take?
 I think Ji is responsible. He has been feeding them too much, and now they're destroying people's crops.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: Yeah, you have a point.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: Ji, let's say I'm interested in buying these finches off you. What would you say to that?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_ji_05.ogg Ji: Are you serious, Captain? Oh, that'd be great! Honestly, with all this trouble they've been causing me lately, they've become a bit of a burden... so if you're happy to take them off my hands, that would be perfect.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: Alright. Deal. My only condition is, you have to use some of the money to compensate Wenjing for her losses.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_ji_06.ogg Ji: Ah, come on... but I never raised them, did I?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: Well, you tell me! You took my deal, that means you admitted to being their owner, doesn't it? Otherwise, what gives you the right to sell them to me?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_wenjing_06.ogg Wenjing: Captain Beidou's right! If you didn't raise them, what makes you think you can go taking her money for them, huh?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_ji_07.ogg Ji: I... uh... well...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: Don't worry. My offer includes plenty left over for you after deducting the compensation.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: This way you get something back for looking after them.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_ji_08.ogg Ji: Okay then... okay! I'll pay the compensation!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_grannyruoxin_05.ogg Granny Ruoxin: I hope you two are very grateful indeed to Beidou. I daresay no one else would be quite so accommodating toward the people of our village!
 I think Ji is innocent. He can't control where the finches make their nests.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_11.ogg Beidou: Hmm. Fair point.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_12.ogg Beidou: Granny Ruoxin, is there anything left over from the relief funds delivered by The Crux on our last visit?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_13.ogg Beidou: Technically, this would be a case of avian damage to agriculture. It meets the relief criteria, so we can use these funds to cover Wenjing's losses.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_grannyruoxin_06.ogg Granny Ruoxin: Why yes, there is plenty left over. The Crux brings such a generous sum each time, there's no way our small village could ever use up all of it.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_wenjing_07.ogg Wenjing: Oh, thank you, Captain Beidou! You can bet I never would have managed to get Ji to pay up, even if I spent my whole life trying to persuade him!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_ji_09.ogg Ji: Thank you, Captain! You can bet I never would have been able to afford the compensation out of my own pocket...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_ji_10.ogg Ji: I'll drive those finches away the moment I get back. I can't let them carry on ruining the neighbors' crops!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_grannyruoxin_07.ogg Granny Ruoxin: Beidou, you do so much for our village, and we could never hope to repay you.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_14.ogg Beidou: Granny Ruoxin, as you know, many of the boys from your fine village do sterling work for The Crux.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_15.ogg Beidou: The fleet wouldn't be what it is today without them. So please, think nothing of it.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_16.ogg Beidou: Ji, Wenjing, I guess you're free to go.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_popsxing_01.ogg Pops Xing: Captain Beidou! Captain Beidou, you're here.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_17.ogg Beidou: Pops Xing! It's been a long time. How have you been?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_popsxing_02.ogg Pops Xing: *sigh* Don't get me started... I've been having some real trouble with that neighbor of mine, Ren. We keep having the same argument, and it just goes nowhere.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_popsxing_03.ogg Pops Xing: I heard you were in the village, so I rushed over to seek your help.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_beidou_18.ogg Beidou: What's the issue?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905401_popsxing_04.ogg Pops Xing: Come with me, you'll see. Let's go find Ren and clear this whole thing up face to face.

 Step DescriptionHearing that Beidou has come to their village, Pops Xing asks her to help mediate in a disagreement. It seems that everyone here thinks very highly of her. Go see what's going on...

(Go to Ren for a little conversation)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_01.ogg Ren: C—Captain Beidou? You're here.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: Heh. I heard that you and Pops Xing had a little misunderstanding. So what's up? Tell me about it.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_popsxing_01.ogg Pops Xing: Ren planted a tree on his property a few years back.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_popsxing_02.ogg Pops Xing: I had no issue with it at the time. It's just a tree. But a few years on, it's grown taller than the roof of my house!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_popsxing_03.ogg Pops Xing: Every morning when I get up and open the window, I just want to feel the sun on my face, but I'm greeted instead by the looming shadow of my neighbor's tree. It really affects my mood.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_popsxing_04.ogg Pops Xing: I asked Ren to cut it down, so I could get some sunlight back on my property.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_popsxing_05.ogg Pops Xing: But he said no! Ugh! It's like he's done this on purpose just to drive me crazy...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_02.ogg Ren: Captain Beidou, you gotta believe me, I didn't intend to block the sunlight, but there's nothing I can do about it now.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_03.ogg Ren: It's not just any old tree, you see... that tree was planted there by my late father!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_04.ogg Ren: Not long after he planted it, he passed away, and just before he passed, he left me with some parting words.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_05.ogg Ren: He said our family's fortune was inauspicious, and we needed something to suppress the bad luck. That's what he planted the tree for... how can I just chop it down?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_06.ogg Ren: I'll be honest, I spent a few years studying in Liyue Harbor, so I don't actually share his superstitious beliefs...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_07.ogg Ren: But still... that doesn't change the fact that this was my father's dying wish.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: Ok. I think I'm all clear on the situation.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), what are you thinking?
 I don't think it's fair for Pops Xing to suffer over this.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: Yeah, you have a point.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: Ren, I'm truly sorry to hear that your father passed away. But look... you can't use that as an excuse for harming other people.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: You really should have thought about the impact that planting that tree would have on your neighbors before you went ahead with it.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: However, this tree is special to you... I understand that, and it would be cruel to make you chop it down.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: So how about you move the tree to somewhere where it won't block the sunlight? Somewhere else in your courtyard, or even outside it if you have to. Just as long as it stops posing a problem for Pops Xing.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: Ren, Pops Xing — thoughts?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_popsxing_06.ogg Pops Xing: Your idea works for me, Captain Beidou! Forcing Ren to cut it down was never my real goal, I just want some sunlight back. That's all I ask.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_08.ogg Ren: *sigh* Honestly, I already considered that. It's a nice idea, but the tree's way too big. We haven't got the manpower in the village to take on a task like that...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: Oh, you don't need to worry about that. I'll just have my crew head down to the harbor and find you a few pairs of strong arms. Problem solved.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_11.ogg Beidou: While they're at it, I'll have them find you a gardener, too. This tree is a little overdue for a manicure...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_09.ogg Ren: Wow, thank you so much, Captain Beidou. Now that this is resolved, it'll be such a relief to be able to put it all behind me.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_10.ogg Ren: On a separate note... I remember The Crux last visited the village not very long ago.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_11.ogg Ren: Is there some special reason why you're back in person so soon?
 I think Ren deserves some leniency.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_12.ogg Beidou: Mmm, I was thinking along the same lines as you.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_13.ogg Beidou: Look Pops, I'm not trying to make excuses for Ren, but just try putting yourself in his shoes for a moment.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_14.ogg Beidou: Ren's desire to protect his tree isn't for money, or because he wants to hurt anyone, or for the sake of any superstition.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_15.ogg Beidou: He just wants to honor his father's dying wish. Pops... you have kids, too, right?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_popsxing_07.ogg Pops Xing: Yeah... when you put it like that...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_16.ogg Beidou: Pops, if you can agree to it, I'll have a word with Granny Ruoxin and see about getting you some money from the relief fund, as compensation for having your sunlight blocked...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_17.ogg Beidou: As for the tree...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_popsxing_08.ogg Pops Xing: Uh... that sounds good to me! Whatever you think, Captain Beidou...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_popsxing_09.ogg Pops Xing: The tree can stay!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_popsxing_10.ogg Pops Xing: Some compensation would make me feel much better about the whole thing.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_12.ogg Ren: Thank you, Captain Beidou! And thank you for understanding, Pops Xing! I'll make sure to trim it back when I get home to let some more light through...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_13.ogg Ren: It'll be such a relief not to have to worry about this anymore.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_14.ogg Ren: On a separate note... I remember The Crux last visited the village not very long ago.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_15.ogg Ren: Is there some special reason why you're back in person so soon?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_18.ogg Beidou: Haha, nothing all that special, just personal reasons. I'm looking for some treasure.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_16.ogg Ren: Huh? Treasure? Wait a second... that reminds me, I saw Changping and Defu arguing in the fields earlier. It sounded like they were both trying to lay claim to some treasure...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_ren_17.ogg Ren: I don't know if it's related to the one you were looking for. But anyway, they're probably still there now.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905402_beidou_19.ogg Beidou: Really? Okay, well, you and Pops Xing can go about your business now. I'll go see what the situation is.

 Step DescriptionYou hear from Ren that Changping and Defu are currently arguing over some treasure. Time to see what's happening...

(Look for Changping and Defu)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_changping_01.ogg Changping: Huh? Beidou!? You're just in time. Defu is being completely unreasonable!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: What happened?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_defu_01.ogg Defu: I'm not being unreasonable, Captain. I got Changping to help me plow my land, because it's the busy season.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_defu_02.ogg Defu: And then, what do you know — he plows up a treasure chest!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_defu_03.ogg Defu: Way I see it, it's my land, so the treasure belongs to me. Right? I think it's a pretty clear-cut case.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_changping_02.ogg Changping: You say that, Defu, but what you're forgetting is that I came to help you plow your fields out of the goodness of my heart, and you haven't paid me a single Mora.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_changping_03.ogg Changping: It was also my plowing that turned up this chest. However you cut it, surely I'm entitled to at least some of the treasure?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: Haha, the domestic drama just keeps coming today. What are your thoughts, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 I know a legal expert. I think she is better suited to handling this kind of stuff.
 I don't have your clout. You should be the one making the call.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: Okay. I think I'm up to speed here. If you two really want to take this further, I can get a legal expert from Liyue Harbor to adjudicate.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: As for the costs, I'll cover them. What do you think?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_changping_04.ogg Changping: Umm...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_defu_04.ogg Defu: Uhh...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: Neither of you seems thrilled about this course of action. Okay, so plan B.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: I'll be straight with you — the reason I came here today was to look for some treasure. Chances are it's hiding right there in the chest you're both fighting over.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: So how about you two stop fighting over it, and do me a favor by handing it to me?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: Of course, I'll be indebted to both of you. If either of you ever needs anything in the future, The Crux will not hesitate to lend you our support.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_defu_05.ogg Defu: Captain, you're far too kind, really. Indebted? That won't be necessary. If you want this chest, you go ahead and take it.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_changping_05.ogg Changping: Yep, totally agree! If only I'd known you were looking for this chest...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_changping_06.ogg Changping: You should've said something! I would have delivered it to you personally to save you the trip.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_defu_06.ogg Defu: It seems like it's been quite a busy day for you. Helping us settle all our little quarrels...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_defu_07.ogg Defu: Come on! Let's go to the village. I'll rally the masses, we'll get some good food and good drink, and have a good old get-together!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905404_changping_07.ogg Changping: Don't worry about the chest. I'll carry it over!

Honorary Villager[]
 Step DescriptionAt your suggestion, the two of you decide to seek the treasure in Qingce Village. What will you encounter on the way?

(Wait until nighttime (21:00–24:00))
(Take part in the village banquet)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905405_grannyruoxin_01.ogg Granny Ruoxin: What a fine day today has been... Beidou has solved an awful lot of problems in our village.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905405_ji_01.ogg Ji: She sure has! Without Captain Beidou, that compensation payment would've bankrupted me.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905405_ren_01.ogg Ren: Yeah, and if it weren't for Captain Beidou, I'd still be arguing with Pops Xing!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905405_defu_01.ogg Defu: Hear, hear! We all have plenty to thank Captain Beidou for, I'm sure. I propose a toast in her honor!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905405_changping_01.ogg Changping: To Captain Beidou! Cheers!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905405_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: I couldn't ask for more than the chance to get everyone together and drink to our hearts' content. Cheers!
After the lively celebration...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905405_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: Whew! That really hit the spot. (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), wanna get some air? The view in this place is pretty good.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905405_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: We can take a look through the contents of that chest while we're at it. Changping placed it by the waterwheel.
 Are you sure you haven't had too much to drink?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905405_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: Pff! Are you kidding? Beidou can handle her liquor!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905405_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: Come on, come on, let's go.

 Step DescriptionAfter three rounds of drinks, Beidou invites you to go out to shoot the breeze — and maybe find out what's in that chest...

(Talk to Granny Ruoxin again)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_grannyruoxin_01.ogg Granny Ruoxin: It's not often this village gets so lively. Make yourself at home, Traveler, help yourself to some food and drink.
(Talk to Ji again)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_ji_01.ogg Ji: It's not just me saying this, honestly — those finches are the cutest little things! So plump and fluffy... Traveler, do you want to swing by my place and see them?
(Talk to Wenjing again)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_wenjing_01.ogg Wenjing: Ji may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but even I can't deny he's just a big softie at heart.
(Talk to Ren again)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_ren_01.ogg Ren: Why isn't Pops Xing here tonight?
(Talk to Defu again)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_defu_01.ogg Defu: Changping, come on, let me top you off!
(Talk to Changping again)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_changping_01.ogg Changping: Thanks, but no thanks... I'm getting a little light-headed...
(Observe Cup, located on the table in front of Ren)
Observe Cup: The crystal-clear fluid that fills this cup is a fruit juice that Beidou specially ordered for you.
(Go to the waterwheel where the chest is)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: So I've been thinking, everyone seems to trust me enough to let me have the final word on their disputes...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: But don't you think some of my solutions can be a little stupid?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: You can laugh, I don't mind. Take Changping and Defu's wrangling over that chest, for instance...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: I had no clue who it should belong to. So I just came up with this stupid idea of taking it for myself. At least that way, neither of them would feel like it was unfair.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: But I mean, I'm no Ningguang. I can't make a perfect deal every time.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: And I'm no Yanfei, either. Not all my judgment calls are gonna be 100% fair and square.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: I am Beidou, and my strength is in trading favors.
 So the captain of The Crux just hands out favors to everyone all the time?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: Haha, you think I should be more selective?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: Some people think their favors are so valuable that they need to plan out how and when to use them to maximize the return on their investment. They view the favor as a bargaining chip.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: Others see doing favors as a burden. Not worth anything in monetary terms, and prone to getting you locked in a cycle of constantly returning the favor back and forth.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_11.ogg Beidou: But the way I see it, favors are what keep people connected to one another.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_12.ogg Beidou: Over thousands of years, the people of Liyue have created bonds between each other by doing someone a favor here, and asking for a favor there.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_13.ogg Beidou: This means that no individual is truly on their own out there. When someone falls down, there's an invisible net made of human connections, waiting to catch them and get them back on their feet.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_14.ogg Beidou: Over the years, I have come to owe favors to a great many people, and many other people have come to owe me one.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_15.ogg Beidou: These are the countless bonds between us, like so many fish in the sea. And they are the reason that The Crux and I have survived the countless hardships we've faced.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_16.ogg Beidou: I believe that if there ever comes a day when the world is overrun by monsters, Liyue's legal system collapses, and the land is thrust back into an age of war...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_17.ogg Beidou: It is these bonds that will see us all through the dark days ahead, until we come out on the other side.
 So the reason you asked for my help with finding the treasure today was so that you can owe me a favor?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_18.ogg Beidou: I'm not saying that. But either way, we have a pretty firm bond between us already, don't you think?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_19.ogg Beidou: Haha! Was this wind brewed in a winery? It's making me light-headed...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_20.ogg Beidou: I feel like I'm forgetting something... something we were literally just talking about...
 If you forgot, that means it's not important.
 You did mention that treasure chest...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_21.ogg Beidou: Oh, yeah! The chest! Haha... I got so immersed in our conversation that I forgot all about the main event...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_22.ogg Beidou: Come on. Let's open it up and see what's inside.
You all open the Chest and are overwhelmed by the putrid smell of years old rotten cabbage.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_23.ogg Beidou: Hahahaha. That's it? A whole lot of nothing?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_24.ogg Beidou: It's not exactly what I was looking for... but you know what, I don't care. The fun part was going on a treasure hunt with you!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905406_beidou_25.ogg Beidou: Come on, let's get back to the party! Tonight, we go big before we go home!

 Quest DescriptionNingguang would like to use the board game she created to commemorate the battle against Osial. As such, she wishes to produce a very special figurine.

(Accompany Ningguang to have the piece made)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 01.ogg Ying'er: Oh, Lady Ningguang, and the Traveler.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: You already know each other?
 We've met before.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 02.ogg Ying'er: Oh, I think it goes a little deeper than that... I don't teach my hard-earned skills to just anyone, you know.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 03.ogg Ying'er: There's a word for people like you, who are warm one minute and cold the next. "Fickle."
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: You seem to be in a good mood today.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 04.ogg Ying'er: As ever. There's nothing special about today, but seeing you two has definitely perked me up.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 05.ogg Ying'er: All jokes aside, how can I be of service today?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 ningguang 03a.ogg Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 ningguang 03b.ogg Ningguang: Remember the custom chess pieces I told you about? I'd like you to take (‍hishisText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) measurements today.
 But isn't she in the porcelain business?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 06.ogg Ying'er: Whatever business I'm in, I am first and foremost a woman of many talents. Don't you remember when I taught you how to make perfume? There was no porcelain involved in that.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 07.ogg Ying'er: As it happens, I am a skilled tailor as well. What can I say, I'm in the prime of my youth and I love all beautiful things... Is that so strange?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: Ying'er is every bit as proficient as any of the top tailors in the land. I've availed myself of her services many times before.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 08.ogg Ying'er: ...Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just realizing that the Traveler only thinks I'm good at one thing. I see how it is. In which case...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 09.ogg Ying'er: You'll find all the tools you could need in the room. Please, help yourselves. I'll stay outside and mind my own porcelain business, as you quite rightly suggested.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: Huh? What are you expecting me to do here...?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 10.ogg Ying'er: Oh, I think the Traveler is the one you should be asking about that...
 I wasn't suggesting anything...
 Stop twisting my words!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 11.ogg Ying'er: Hahaha, I'm kidding! I'm kidding.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 12.ogg Ying'er: It's hard not to tease when you're both so well-matched.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 13.ogg Ying'er: Come on, then. Step inside and I'll examine your body from tip to toe, hehehe.
After all that, Ying'er takes your measurements quite uneventfully.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: *sigh*...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: If I hear any strange new rumors after this, you will be my number one suspect.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 14.ogg Ying'er: Rumors about the Traveler? Or the chess piece?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Either. Both are confidential.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 15.ogg Ying'er: Don't worry. I know where the line is. I'd never take a joke too far.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 16.ogg Ying'er: Secrets are only fun when they're kept secret.
 I hope you do know where the line is...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: Just... enough with the ambiguous phrasing, okay? You'll give people the wrong idea... Ugh, forget it. Let's just go.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913501 yinger 17.ogg Ying'er: You're always welcome at Scent of Spring. Come again anytime.
(After conversation with Ying'er ends)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: *sigh* I slightly regret bringing you here.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: It doesn't bother me. I just hope she didn't make you feel too awkward...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: Now that your measurements are taken, let's go to Mingxing Jewelry and put an order in.
(Talk to Ying'er again)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 yinger 01.ogg Ying'er: You are always welcome to come back, either alone or with your new friend. Hehe.

(Go to Mingxing Jewelry to place an order)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 xingxi 01.ogg Xingxi: Hello, Lady Ningguang. What can I do for you today?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: That chess piece I told you about — we can start work now. I have the Traveler's measurements here.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 xingxi 02.ogg Xingxi: Okay, let me just double-check... Mm-hmm, looks good. This has all the measurements we need. I'll pass them on to the craftsman shortly.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: Good. And as agreed, please use top-grade materials only.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 xingxi 03.ogg Xingxi: Of course. We are professionals, and we will do everything we can to deliver the high standard you expect.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 xingxi 04.ogg Xingxi: Although, speaking to you as a friend, I have to tell you that the sale price you indicated won't even cover the cost of production...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 xingxi 05.ogg Xingxi: I don't mean just the material costs, either. Waiting around for top-quality materials drags out the production time and also reduces the total quantity we can produce.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: That's okay. This one is not for profit.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: With every previous set, there has always been some degree of commercial or marketing considerations to bear in mind. But this one serves more of a commemorative purpose.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: To that point, as you know, the prototype of the Jade Chamber chess piece has been in the works for a long time, but I haven't once followed up on the progress.
 Jade Chamber? There's a Jade Chamber piece in this chess set?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: Yes. And just like your piece, the Jade Chamber piece will be scaled for the game.
 Now I understand Xingxi's concern.
 It's a huge undertaking...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 xingxi 06.ogg Xingxi: Yes, it's a challenging project. But also, "not for profit" is really not something I ever expected from Lady Ningguang...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 xingxi 07.ogg Xingxi: How do I put it? It just seems... out of character.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: In business, everything comes down to profits versus losses. You have to keep a cool head and make rational judgments. In other words, you must be shrewd.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: But shrewdness is easily perceived as cynicism in the eyes of others. People come to think of you as someone who cares only about money, and not people.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: Hardly the worst thing in the world, of course. But it has caused obstacles for me in the past.
 How?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: Well, for example, I once had a case where someone backed out of a deal with me to sell to someone else. We were both offering the exact same terms, it was simply because they didn't like me very much.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: Another case was where I offered distinctly more competitive terms in an investment, and this ended up arousing their suspicion.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: "That Ningguang," they thought... "She must be up to something. We can't let her get away with it..."
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 xingxi 08.ogg Xingxi: I see...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 16.ogg Ningguang: But these problems disappeared all but completely after the battle against Osial.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 17.ogg Ningguang: Why? Because the whole of Liyue witnessed me destroying my Jade Chamber.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 18.ogg Ningguang: At least, that's the most reasonable explanation I can think of.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 xingxi 09.ogg Xingxi: Oh, I get it! You're saying that back when you sacrificed the Jade Chamber, you gained everyone's respect in return.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 xingxi 10.ogg Xingxi: You're not seeking to make a profit from these chess pieces because what you're commemorating is your personal contribution to Liyue Harbor!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 xingxi 11.ogg Xingxi: It was the deal of the century, and as long as you keep capitalizing on it, business will be plain sailing for you in the future.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 19.ogg Ningguang: ...Yes. Exactly. Very to the point.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 xingxi 12.ogg Xingxi: Truly a brilliant strategy, Lady Ningguang! You really are a business mastermind.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 xingxi 13.ogg Xingxi: Now I understand why this set needs to be so perfect and why it's okay that it doesn't turn a profit.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 20.ogg Ningguang: It will be a lot of work, and I'm most grateful to you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 21a.ogg Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 21b.ogg Ningguang: Make sure the Traveler's piece is exactly how (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍) wants it. We can't go letting (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) down.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 xingxi 14.ogg Xingxi: Don't you worry, we'll put our all into it!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 22.ogg Ningguang: Well, that's that then. Let's head back to the Jade Chamber.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913502 ningguang 23.ogg Ningguang: There's something I want to discuss with you.
(Talk to Xingxi again)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 xingxi 01.ogg Xingxi: Lady Ningguang is simply brilliant. Once again, she has blown my mind.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 xingxi 02.ogg Xingxi: There's so much I can learn from her.

After the Descent[]

(Return to the Jade Chamber and talk to Ningguang)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: I have a question for you. I'd like to hear your honest opinion.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: And I, in turn, will tell you how I really think.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: When we were at Mingxing Jewelry, I admitted that my decision to sacrifice the Jade Chamber was a calculated one. I had already considered what I stood to lose and to gain.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: When you heard that... did it make you think that maybe I really was a cynical profit-chaser after all?
 Honestly... yes. I was a little disappointed.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: I see...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: Well then I'm sorry, but what I'm about to say may simply come across as making excuses.
 I think all you're trying to do is make up for your losses.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: Yes, well, at the time, it seemed to me that sacrificing the Jade Chamber was the inevitable decision.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: All that talk about making up for my losses was really just to console myself.
 The point is that you stepped up when the time came.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: ...Thank you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: Yes, you see things the way they are, however they may appear on the surface.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: ...I was lying to Xingxi.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: My decision to destroy the Jade Chamber was nowhere near as thought-through as I made it out to be. I just thought we should do what needed to be done, and this was a decision that only I could make.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: Afterwards, I consoled myself by reasoning that all my wealth comes from Liyue Harbor, so to lose Liyue Harbor is to lose everything. In that sense, giving up the Jade Chamber would be a profitable investment in the long term.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: But it just didn't work — I was grief-stricken, like a huge part of my heart was suddenly missing...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: Because I had just severed ties with a lifelong companion.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 16.ogg Ningguang: I stared out at the sea for goodness knows how long... I just couldn't let it go... I just couldn't.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 17.ogg Ningguang: There was no way I could console myself... So why bother trying?
 ...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 18.ogg Ningguang: But as time went by, I received so many thank-you gifts and letters from people... Everyone was describing how they now saw me in a new light, how I'd become an inspiration to them.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 19.ogg Ningguang: I gave up the Jade Chamber without a moment's hesitation, and I did it for the sake of Liyue Harbor. And now, people are inspired to follow my example, to tackle their life challenges with the same unswerving determination.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 20.ogg Ningguang: All of this was so encouraging to hear. It made me feel that my dear old companion's sacrifice was not in vain.
 So why did you lie to Xingxi?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 21.ogg Ningguang: Because... to most people, the idea that Lady Ningguang is someone who battles with grief and struggles to let go of the past is probably the furthest thing from the truth that they could imagine.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 22.ogg Ningguang: This is one aspect of the truth that I can share only with you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 23.ogg Ningguang: The fact that... I can't always be as strong as everyone thinks I am.
 The most difficult time has passed.
 You've done so well.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 24.ogg Ningguang: Thank you for your comforting words. It feels good even just to be able to talk about it.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 25.ogg Ningguang: I'm sorry that you have to see me in this state...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 26.ogg Ningguang: But look where I am now. Standing on the deck of the Jade Chamber once more, taking in the view... It must be fate's reward to me.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913503 ningguang 27.ogg Ningguang: And if I end up having to do it all over again in the future... I will not hesitate to make the same decision again.

Media:vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 01.ogg Fu San'er: It's dangerous to walk alone here, isn't it?
Media:vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 02.ogg Fu San'er: You have no idea who... or what you'll meet.
 ...
 Hello.
Media:vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 03.ogg Fu San'er: Hmm, you seem to be pretty calm. You know, there's a saying, "you can't keep your shoes dry if you keep walking along the river."
Media:vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 04.ogg Fu San'er: You're bound to run into something in such a strange and eerie place...
Media:vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 05.ogg Fu San'er: And what you encounter here could become a nightmare that haunts you for the rest of your life.
 Oh, really?
 Sorry, I don't get it... What are you doing here?
Media:vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 06.ogg Fu San'er: Huh? How are you so calm? People usually run away in terror before I can finish a sentence.
 You look like just another average person to me.
Media:vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 07.ogg Fu San'er: Yeah... but a more sophisticated way to play a ghost is to create a creepy atmosphere that scares people psychologically.
 Don't you have a costume or anything like that?
Media:vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 09.ogg Fu San'er: Yes, I have one, but it's too hot to wear... and besides, a more sophisticated way to play a ghost is to create a creepy atmosphere that scares people psychologically.
Media:vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 08.ogg Fu San'er: In which case, my appearance becomes irrelevant.
Media:vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 11.ogg Fu San'er: *sigh* Besides, I'll never be able to scare someone like you who doesn't believe in ghosts to begin with.
 Sounds like you're just slacking off to me...
Media:vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 12.ogg Fu San'er: Hey, that's not true! Oh, I'd better go find some wimps to scare now!
Media:vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 13.ogg Fu San'er: You should go back and find your partner. He might be terrified by now.

Dialogue[]
 Quest DescriptionNingguang would like to relive the experiences she had when she was just starting out. She thus invites you to play a game of starting from the very bottom. You head to the wharf together...

(Go to the wharf to search for abandoned goods)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 01.ogg Gou San'er: L—Lady Ningguang, to what do I owe the honor?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 02.ogg Gou San'er: Are you here to inspect the goods in the warehouse? You may have to wait a moment, I, uh, must have not gotten the message...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 03.ogg Gou San'er: Sorry, I won't be long. I'll grab all the paperwork right away!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Calm down, no need to panic. That's not why we're here.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 04.ogg Gou San'er: Uh... Oh, you're just looking for... for me?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 05.ogg Gou San'er: I haven't done anything! Have I? I mean, I don't think so...? Uhhh...
 We want to know about the unclaimed and abandoned goods.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 06.ogg Gou San'er: Oh right. The periodic clearances, yeah. I've been handling those, strictly per the protocol.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 07.ogg Gou San'er: I make sure I post all the necessary notices and notify every individual that I'm required to.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 08.ogg Gou San'er: It used to be a huge problem. But with a bit of hard work, I've managed to reduce the amount of goods we need to clear out by at least half.
 Why do so many goods get abandoned in the first place?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 09.ogg Gou San'er: It's hard to say. It really depends, everyone has their own reasons.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 10.ogg Gou San'er: But as far as the warehouse is concerned, they all fall into these categories: unclaimed goods, damaged goods, or unpaid storage fees.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 11.ogg Gou San'er: As for the damaged ones, I guarantee you it's nothing to do with how they're stored. It's because some things go bad more easily than others.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 12.ogg Gou San'er: If it sits there in the warehouse for too long, it goes without saying that it could start to affect the other goods. But that aside, even the smell is just unbearable...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: So, have you cleared out any of these goods recently?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 13.ogg Gou San'er: Um... I'm afraid we just finished clearing out all the big ones.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 14.ogg Gou San'er: But don't worry, Lady Ningguang! If you're here for an inspection, then I'm here to make it happen. Hang tight, I'll grab some of the smaller items for you right away!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: Hold on...
 Off he goes.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: I don't think he has quite grasped the nature of this situation.
 It's like he was reporting on his work.
 Can't really blame him.
After waiting for a while, Gou San'er comes back, panting for breath.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 15.ogg Gou San'er: Lady Ningguang... I... I had a quick run through the list, and... cleared out some more... items. Please... inspect them... at your leisure...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: Let me see here... soggy food, an odd shoe, a broken mirror, small wooden toy...
 They're in terrible shape. No wonder no one wants them.
 Not a whole lot of use.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: It's a shame we missed the last clearance. We're down to the slim pickings now.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: Hmm... some of these are true junk, but there are a few items of value here.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Take this wooden toy, for example. The wood is good quality. If you took it apart, there is quite a number of useful everyday objects that you could turn it into with a little work...
 Can we have this stuff?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 16.ogg Gou San'er: Huh? ...You want it?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 17.ogg Gou San'er: Well sure, take whatever you want. It's all getting thrown away anyway.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: Great. This is going well.
 Let's take some time to sift through what we have acquired.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: Yes, and once we're done, we will find a merchant to give us an appraisal of their value.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913601 gousaner 18.ogg Gou San'er: (I have no idea what's going on here, and I'm not about to ask, either...)
(Obtain Bag of Retrieved Items ×1)
(Talk to Gou San'er again)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 gousaner 01.ogg Gou San'er: Take care. If there's anything else you need, just give me a shout.

(Sell the material to the merchant)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 01.ogg Bolai: Lady Ningguang, welcome to my humble store. What can I get for you?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Actually, today's a little different. I'm not here to buy anything. I wanted to ask if you could take a look at some goods for me.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 02.ogg Bolai: Just... take a look? What for?
 To give me an estimate on their value.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 03.ogg Bolai: Oh, I see. Let me take a look then.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 04.ogg Bolai: Hmm...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 05.ogg Bolai: I mean, I can take them. I have a few regular customers I can talk to, they should be able to salvage the raw materials. Shouldn't take long at all.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 06.ogg Bolai: But, uh...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: What's wrong? If it's too much trouble, please, there's no need to force it.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 07.ogg Bolai: N-no, no, no, it's nothing like that...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 08.ogg Bolai: Uh... Well, anyway, let's talk prices.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 09.ogg Bolai: So all these together, heh...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 10.ogg Bolai: I'll give you 150,000 Mora. How does that sound?
 (That's so much!)
 (I think he added a couple of zeros by accident...)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: Oh, well...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 11.ogg Bolai: Uh, no worries, no worries. The price is negotiable, of course, so we can discuss it further.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 12.ogg Bolai: If that figure's not what you had in mind, I can, uh... bump it up a little. It'll be fine. I'm sure we can reach an agreement here.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: What are your thoughts?
 Honestly, that's way too much...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: Yes. At most, these items are only worth a couple of thousand Mora.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 13.ogg Bolai: Huh? Wait a minute, so you're really here just to sell a few things?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 14.ogg Bolai: And, uh, specifically... these things?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 15.ogg Bolai: I thought that was all code for some kind of inspection, or something...
 So we were misunderstood again.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: It appears so. We can't go on like this.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: Let's try something else. As long as we're in Liyue Harbor, this kind of misunderstanding is inevitable.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: If I wasn't Ningguang, Gou San'er probably wouldn't have handed all of these over to us.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: And you likely wouldn't be willing to buy them, either.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 16.ogg Bolai: To be completely honest... You're not wrong.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: This goes against the rules we set for ourselves at the start.
 Then we'll just have to leave Liyue Harbor and live an adventurer's life.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: Are there any other ways for adventurers to make Mora besides their remuneration from the Guild?
 We can go treasure hunting in Guili Plains. But the work is hard and the payout is low.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: Great! I don't mind, let's give it a try. Lead the way.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913602 bolai 17.ogg Bolai: You two have a good one...
(Talk to Bolai again)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913603 bolai 01.ogg Bolai: What in the heck has gotten into Lady Ningguang today...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913603 bolai 02.ogg Bolai: Did I say that aloud? Never mind.

Adventurer's Survival Handbook[]

(Go out and search for treasure)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913603 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: This must be the place. Let's do this.
(Talk to Ningguang after defeating the monsters)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913605 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Ahhhh. It feels like it's been a long time since I've gotten so physical.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913605 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: The feeling of creating your wealth with your own two hands is just as exhilarating as ever.
 Even for this paltry amount?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913605 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: Yes, I'd say so. Everything starts out small, you focus on quantity at the outset, and gradually shift to focusing on quality as your wealth builds.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913605 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: And let's not forget we started with no initial capital. It's reasonable to expect building something from nothing to be highly demanding.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913605 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: In any case... the sight of Mora has always had a way of improving my mood, no matter what the sum is.
 Then let's keep this momentum going.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913605 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: I intend to. I am not ready to stop yet.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913605 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: This time, let's try something a little more challenging.
(Obtain Light Mora Purse ×1)
(Continue looking for chests)
(Talk to Ningguang after defeating the second group of monsters)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913606 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Another satisfying haul. Ah, what a feeling.
 You're very good at this.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913606 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: That's very kind of you. But I know I'm no match for a professional adventurer like yourself.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913606 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: For me, a battle is just a form of exercise. A way to keep fit and use up any surplus energy.
 Have you scratched the itch yet?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913606 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: Oh no, not yet! There's more Mora to be made.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913606 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: Hey, look. What's that hole in the ground?
 I think it was dug by a Weasel Thief.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913606 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: Oh, I see. So if we catch it, there's Mora for the taking?
 It's almost as fond of Mora as you are. Go figure.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913606 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: Ooh, how quaint. That was your Beidou impression, was it?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913606 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Hah. Well, I'm afraid I'm having far too much fun to stop what I'm doing and start bickering with you, Captain.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913606 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: Come on. Let's go get this Weasel Thief.
(Obtain Full Mora Purse ×1)

(Look for the Weasel Thief's tracks)
(Check the hole that the Weasel Thief left behind)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913609 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: There it is! After it!
(Find the Mora that the Weasel Thief was hiding)

Open Resourcer, Thrifty Expenditure[]

Media:vo ngcop001 1913603 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Goodness. This reminds me of fishing... not an easy catch.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913603 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: But we didn't let it slip away, and the haul is now ours. That's what counts.
 How much did we make?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913603 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: Let's see... a little over 1,000 Mora.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913603 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: We can't do any serious business with this amount of starting capital. We need to keep working hard.
 Do you need to take a break?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913603 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: Actually, now that you mention it, I'm suddenly a little hungry. Huh. Amidst the thrill of the chase, I didn't even notice.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913603 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: Wangshu Inn is right there, but...
 Based on our current financial position, we can rule that out.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913603 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Same thoughts here. After how hard we worked to get our hands on this Mora, it would be a shame to eat it all in a single sitting.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913603 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: In which case, I think I'll take this opportunity to show you a skill that I used to be rather proud of.
 Fishing?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913603 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: Yes, but the rule of the game is no Fishing Rods allowed. We're going fishing by hand.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913603 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: Come on. Let's go down to the river.

(After catching fish and obtaining Plump Fish ×3 by the river)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913612 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: This should be enough. Let's head back to land and grill them.
(Grill the fish by the shore with Ningguang)
Ningguang grills the fish like a pro.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913604 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Here. Have a taste of my cooking.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913604 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: A fresh catch can go straight on the grill with minimal preparation and it tastes delicious, even with no seasoning.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913604 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: It's a little charred, that's on purpose. I just like how it tastes.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913604 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: Normally, I have to make a special request to the chef if I want it to taste like this.
 Thank you.
 You must be ready for a rest by now?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913604 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: It was nothing.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913604 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: Back in the day, I had to hurry home after work to do my household chores. Then in the evening, it was out to the night market with the family to support our stall.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913604 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: I was always meticulous with the most menial of tasks. My mother always loved that about me.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913604 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: But by the same token, she didn't love the idea of me leaving home and starting my own business. She thought it was just an unnecessary risk when I could just carry on helping out at home instead.
 If you'd followed her advice, people wouldn't be calling you "Lady Ningguang" today.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913604 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: You'd be more likely to see me pulling up outside Wanmin Restaurant and selling Grilled Tiger Fish from a food cart.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913604 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: My childhood memories run deep. I'll always have a special affection for fish.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913604 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: They are confined to the water, and yet they live free, swimming around wherever the mood takes them.
 A lot like adventuring.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913604 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: It is. I have greatly enjoyed experiencing the adventurer lifestyle with you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913604 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: When I think back on all my hard work in the past, it motivates me to face the challenges that lie ahead in the future.
 Next time, I'll grill fish for you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913604 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: Hehe, that sounds great. I'm looking forward to it.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913604 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: But a word of warning, I am very picky about my grilled fish... I can be a tough lady to impress.

 Quest DescriptionAfter hearing about the client's budget problems, Kaveh decides to adopt a more cost-effective and simplistic style.
Field Study[]

Media:vo kvcop001 1907101 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Most materials going from Caravan Ribat to Aaru Village would pass through here.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907101 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: There are a lot of monsters out here today. Let's clear the area. If you find it hard to keep up, just let us know.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907101 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: Oh, don't worry about me, this is nothin'. I'll be careful though, and you should do the same.
(After defeating the enemies)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: Phew... *grimace*...
 Are you hurt?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 02.ogg Badawi: I'm fine. Haha, I've spent my entire life fighting these kinds of monsters in the desert, after all. They won't get the best of me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 03.ogg Badawi: But it's one thing to fight against monsters, and another to fight against an old injury... Ugh, it's something I picked up when I was young. There were many fights between mercenary brigades back then, and one day, someone stabbed me in the back.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 04.ogg Badawi: I didn't think much of it back then, but with age it's caught up to me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 05.ogg Badawi: Few mercenaries get to enjoy their later years. Failing health tends to take the joy out of reputation and wealth, and many mercenaries never even made much of the latter to begin with.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Is there someone you know who can help to look after you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 06.ogg Badawi: Unfortunately, no. My wife passed away at an early age, and I don't have any children.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 07.ogg Badawi: Sometimes I'd close my eyes, and realize most of my life story has already been written. I have many regrets about my past, but at the same time, I also know that there were never many options for me in the first place.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 08.ogg Badawi: I joined the Eremites when I was young, and won many battles with them. My survival was more a matter of luck than actual ability.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 09.ogg Badawi: If at all possible, I want future children of the desert to have some more options in life. I don't want them to turn out like me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 10.ogg Badawi: My apologies. The older we get, the more we tend to ramble. Seems like we've already cleared out most of the monsters. Let's hurry over to Aaru Village.
Badawi walks into the distance as he talks. Kaveh is lost in thought as he observes the figure of the elderly man...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: ...
 What's on your mind?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: I think it's really admirable of him to spend his whole life's savings on people he's never met.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Maybe he's doing this out of the kindness of his heart, a kindness that hasn't been eroded away by the struggles of his life.
 Doesn't that also sound like you, Kaveh?
 You're also that kind of person, which is why you're helping him.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: ...Perhaps. To clarify, though, I don't think I'm quite the same...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Some people call me an idealist. Sure, I do have some "idealist" sentiments, such as wanting everyone to be able to lead a happy life.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: But my situation is... more complex than that. In the beginning, what drove me to harbor those thoughts was less "idealism," and more a sense of guilt.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: When I was young, I encouraged my father on a whim to take part in the first Interdarshan Championship hosted by the Akademiya.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: He set off confidently hoping to win something for me, but failed to clinch the title. What's more, he fell into depression after the competition, and requested to join an investigative research project in the desert.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: I never saw him again. Word has it that he got caught in quicksand. Even if other factors may have contributed to his death, the fundamental cause still circles back to me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: I started doing many things in life because I wanted to make amends. Even in cases where I couldn't do something for a specific person, I still did whatever I could. I think I just wanted... to make myself feel a little better.
 And is that still how you feel?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: At this point, even I don't know.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: I've tried self-reflection, but it didn't help. I can't seem to walk away from many things that I see or hear about, even if they don't directly concern me, and I can't quite pinpoint the source of it.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: Maybe it's just like what those Vahumana scholars often say — it's hard for people to truly understand themselves.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: I could be doing things out of endless guilt, or I could be doing them out of a strong sense of empathy. It could even just be a matter of conceit. The potential motivations could number in the dozens, but the actions they result in are the same.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: Anyway, I suppose I don't really mind being called an idealist. They also used that term to describe my father. It seemed to carry fewer connotations back when he was around.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: I've known Alhaitham for many years now, and discussed my ideology with him for nearly as long. Uh, maybe "argued" is a better word for it...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: He told me a long time ago that no matter how strong of a swimmer you may be, you'll still get dragged under by the others who are drowning once you run out of stamina. He believes this is the fate that awaits all idealists.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: I still believe I should live by my ideals, and I've given him countless reasons why I think it's a good idea to do so. Perhaps my ideals are flawed, but are there really any perfect things in this world?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 20.ogg Kaveh: Unfortunately, he remains unconvinced. His personality is the exact opposite of my own. If someone happens to drown next to him, he'll most likely stand on the shore, and mumble something along the lines of "respecting other people's fates."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 21.ogg Kaveh: But as you can see, I'm not the only idealist in the world. Just as there are different seasons, there are also different people. There are many others who will continue to care about the fates of those who are not directly related to them.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 22.ogg Kaveh: ...And when I finally run out of stamina, someone will also reach out and bring me back to shore...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 23.ogg Kaveh: ...Someone will help me, right? ...Yes, I've already been helped like that before.
 Should I have a life preserver at the ready?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 24.ogg Kaveh: Oh please, it's not like we're actually talking about swimming! ...Also, just so you know, I actually took a swimming elective back in the day. Don't underestimate my skills.
 I'll help you when the time comes.
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 25.ogg Kaveh: Haha, but you've helped me plenty already! If you didn't reach out to me, I would probably be passed out on the tavern table right now instead of talking with Badawi.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 26.ogg Kaveh: Either way, I'm feeling much better than when you first found me at the tavern. I can feel inspiration already welling up inside of me... maybe this will be just the opportunity I needed to create a whole new style!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 27.ogg Kaveh: Alright, let's head to Aaru Village!

Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Now that we're here, it's my partner's time to shine. Mehrak!
Mehrak: Beep-boop!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: What's this?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: My toolbox. I built it using an ancient mechanical core. It's not too smart, but it's super useful, and can help me with a variety of tasks.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: I'll take Mehrak and find a suitable location for the building. Once that is done, I'll get to work on a few designs...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 setare 01.ogg Setaria: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 Setaria?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Ah, you know each other?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 setare 02.ogg Setaria: Hello, I suppose you must be Kaveh from Kshahrewar. I've heard of you before. My name is Setaria, and I'm currently the person in charge of promoting educational assistance programs here in the desert.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: Educational assistance programs... Then you must be familiar with the local conditions here.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 setare 03.ogg Setaria: I can't say I'm too familiar just yet, but if you have any questions, I'll try my best to answer them.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: I've been commissioned by Mr. Badawi to build a library in the desert. We've settled on the general design direction, but we are trying to finalize some details based on the conditions around the intended location.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 setare 04.ogg Setaria: A library? Do you intend to open it to the public for free?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 badawi 02.ogg Badawi: That's right. I want to make sure the children will have books to read.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 setare 05.ogg Setaria: That's fantastic, I'm sure the children will be thrilled. Right now, we don't have access to many paper books, or a quiet place to read. Truth be told, this very thing has been keeping me up at night.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Let me get straight to my questions, then. Can you estimate the number of children around here who'd be interested in reading? Besides the usual noise of village pedestrians, are there any other sources of noise in the village?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: Oh, and have any landslides occurred here recently? And also, where are the spots around the village that have been most affected by wind and erosion?
Setaria considers Kaveh's questions and offers her answers...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: ...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: ...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: ...Alright, that should be everything.
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: Badawi, let's go over the budget again. We'll keep the building structure the same, but make the place a little bigger, so it'll be able to hold more people, and get better natural light.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: The parts of the project that'd cost the most will be the insulation and ventilation materials. I'm sure you understand, no one likes to read in a place that's hot and stuffy.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: I want to make significant changes to the arrangement of the bookshelves, tables and chairs. I'll go over the specifics of that shortly. I have two plans in mind — both are pretty minimalist in style, but will provide a very different ambiance from the world outside.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: Our final cost should be around seventy percent of the last figure I quoted. The whole thing should take around half a year to complete.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: Mehrak has produced a sketch for you all to see. If everyone's okay with it, then we'll proceed with that as the formal plan.
 You've got a new design plan already?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: The inspiration just came to me naturally, all I did was put the thoughts to paper.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: I must give you credit, though, if it weren't for your advice and suggestions, I probably wouldn't have landed on this new style so quickly.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: According to the traditions of my profession, I should probably name this style after you. Let's call it the "(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) Style."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 20.ogg Kaveh: In the meantime, let's look forward to the day when this building is completed and can finally open its doors.

 Quest DescriptionYou were here at the Yae Publishing House to keep watch, but...

(Talk to Gorou, optional)
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 55.ogg Gorou: Hmm? I thought you were going to survey the scene at Yae Publishing House?

(Go to Yae Publishing House and keep watch)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 01.ogg Nobuhiro: Alright, everyone, settle down!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 02.ogg Nobuhiro: We are gathered here today united by a common purpose! Now, who can tell me what they think that might be?
 (Let's see what this is all about...)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 01.ogg Hiroshi: Well of course, it's... to tell the whole world about how wonderful Ms. Hina is!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 03.ogg Nobuhiro: An excellent answer!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 04.ogg Nobuhiro: How gentle she is... how understanding she is... how delightfully mischievous she can be, on occasion...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 05.ogg Nobuhiro: We can all testify to the great joy that Ms. Hina has brought to our lives. But my friends, there are so many people out there in this world who still need Ms. Hina's salvation.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 06.ogg Nobuhiro: We can help by spreading the good news about Ms. Hina to every soul in the world!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 yuka 01.ogg Yuka: My friend... do you have a moment to talk about Ms. Hina?
 I've never heard of her.
 Who?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 yuka 02.ogg Yuka: Friends, I found one! Someone needs our help!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 07a.ogg Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 07b.ogg Nobuhiro: Shhh! Calm your voice down, we don't want to scare (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) off!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 08.ogg Nobuhiro: Hello, my friend. On this joyous day, we would like to open our hearts to you and tell you about the existence of a perfect being.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 09.ogg Nobuhiro: She is gentle, kind, understanding... she is the brightest star in our sky. Here, have this pamphlet.
     Mysterious Flyer  
Mysterious Flyer
Teyvat's Big Sister
Gentle and kind, she answers all your questions
She'll help you be rid of all your troubles!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 02.ogg Hiroshi: So what do you think?
 Looks kind of familiar...
 What's this...?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 10.ogg Nobuhiro: Oh, my apologies. In my excitement, I forgot to give you all the details.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 11.ogg Nobuhiro: Have you ever come across a magazine called "That's Life," published by the Yae Publishing House?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 12.ogg Nobuhiro: It's a monthly magazine featuring, amongst other things, an advice column. We were among the first readers to send in letters seeking advice, and we've received kind and gentle replies to each one.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 13.ogg Nobuhiro: Although the editor chose to conceal her name, gender, and other details, we all see her as an empathetic older sister figure, and feel convinced that she must be the same sort of person in real life.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 03.ogg Hiroshi: There is no mistaking it. Just from her letters, I can feel that she respects me, trusts me... she has a natural ability to connect with people.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 04.ogg Hiroshi: She's so considerate. She can always sense our true emotions from our letters and never fails to deliver the advice and the encouragement we need.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 05.ogg Hiroshi: Except when it comes to the topic of romantic love — she's clearly not an expert there. But even then, that just makes her all the more endearing to us!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 yuka 03.ogg Yuka: Recently, the column went through a low period where it just wasn't popular at all. In fact, they almost axed it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 yuka 04.ogg Yuka: Fortunately, Yae Publishing House made the decision to publicize her image, and then the column finally started to grow in popularity.
 So Ms. Hina is...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 14.ogg Nobuhiro: That's right! Ms. Hina is the person in charge of "That's Life" magazine's advice column. She is the one we all admire and adore so greatly.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 15.ogg Nobuhiro: And so, when we heard that Yae Publishing House would be revealing the official likeness of Ms. Hina today, we immediately came here from wherever we were, all over the nation, to gather together...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 16.ogg Nobuhiro: ...and to witness this grand moment in history!
 (I wonder how Gorou would react to this...)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 17.ogg Nobuhiro: Please, gaze upon the radiant beauty of Ms. Hina, see how truly lovely she is...

 Step DescriptionYou've learned the truth behind Ms. Hina. Do you want to break this news to Gorou?

(Talk to Hiroshi, optional)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 06.ogg Hiroshi: Welcome to the Ms. Hina Fan Club!
(Talk to Nobuhiro, optional)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 18.ogg Nobuhiro: I've been following Ms. Hina's column since the very first issue of "That's Life."
(Talk to Yuka, optional)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 yuka 05.ogg Yuka: I don't know if you know the word "fan"? A friendly adventurer lady taught it to us a few years ago. She seemed to know everything.

(Go back and look for Gorou)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Oh? Hey, there you are.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Is you-know-who at Yae Publishing House?
 No, she isn't.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: Phew... That's good.
 What's up, Gorou?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: I just finished writing my replies, so I was about to head to Yae Publishing House and hand them in.
 Why are you helping to write for them?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: Why...? Hmm.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: I guess it's because I can help people this way. Also, the editor said to me, "This is something that only you are capable of."
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: They made quite a solemn request when they first approached me, so I felt like I couldn't refuse it. But once I'd settled into it, I found myself really enjoying it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: Before I knew it, I had written hundreds of replies, and sometimes they'd respond again just to thank me. It made me so happy whenever they'd compliment me.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: Every time I think about that terrifying woman, I feel like I want nothing to do with Yae Publishing House. But then, whenever I think about how my replies can help so many people, I feel a sense of responsibility.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: By this point, I'm so used to it that I'd probably find it hard to adjust if I ever gave it up.
 (I can't let Gorou know the full story...)
 (I'll just have to hide it from him for now...)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Well... I don't know quite what's going on, but I'd like to get these letters delivered quickly while you-know-who isn't around.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: I'm really looking forward to the readers' reactions when they receive my letters. In the army, people are always a little reserved when talking to me, because I'm a general.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: But those obstacles are removed when you're communicating via letters. Everyone who writes seems to treat me like that one friend who they can share anything and everything with.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: So I'm not about to let them down. Let's head over!
 Why don't I deliver them for you...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 15.ogg Gorou: Hmm? But Yae Publishing House isn't far from here, if I remember correctly. Let's just head there together.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 16.ogg Gorou: Besides, this way, if you-know-who does show up, we can look out for each other. Let's go!

(Temporary) Secret-Keeper[]
 Step DescriptionYou were here at Yae Publishing House to keep watch, but ...

(Go to Yae Publishing House with Gorou to deliver the replies)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Strange, it seems unusually lively here today.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: I don't come here often. (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), is it like this most of the time?
 Not really...
 It's a special case today...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: Hey, there seems to be some commotion over there. Let's check it out.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 01.ogg Nobuhiro: Allow me to reiterate, my friends! We in the Ms. Hina Fan Club must abide by the club rules!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 02.ogg Nobuhiro: Firstly, we mustn't try and probe into Ms. Hina's true identity. We of all people cannot cause her any trouble!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 03.ogg Nobuhiro: Secondly, fans of Ms. Hina are not to make any controversial statements when representing the fan club. We must exercise self-discipline and present a good image in front of other people!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 04.ogg Nobuhiro: Thirdly, while our mission is to promote Ms. Hina in every way possible, if someone we're talking to says they're not interested, we are to respect that, and not go forcing it down their throats!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 05.ogg Nobuhiro: And finally! We are here today because Ms. Hina has brought us together. But we are also here to change ourselves for the better, for her sake! Can we do that, people? Can we do that?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 01.ogg Hiroshi: Yes, we can!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 yuka 01.ogg Yuka: Always make her proud, and never bring her down!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Oh! So this is what they call a "Fan Club."
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: I don't know whose fan club it is, but they are raring to go! Reminds me of the rallying speeches we used to give before going into battle.
 Hehe...
 Heh, yeah...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: Hmm, something's up, isn't it... I can tell, you're avoiding my gaze.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: Did something happen? It's not "her," is it?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 02.ogg Hiroshi: Excuse me, friend...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 03.ogg Hiroshi: Something about you looks awfully similar to Ms. Hina...
 You're imagining things!
 No resemblance whatsoever!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 04.ogg Hiroshi: I see, well, one way or another, fate has brought you here. Have you ever heard of Ms. Hina?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: Sorry, I'm not sure...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 05.ogg Hiroshi: Well, now's as good a time as any for you to find out more!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 06.ogg Hiroshi: Ms. Hina is gentle, kind, and considerate. You can tell her anything that is bothering you, and she will patiently advise you on how to deal with it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: Oh! Well, she sounds like a very pleasant person to be around!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: She must be the polar opposite of Yae Miko... right, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 Haha...
 I couldn't say...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 yuka 02.ogg Yuka: But he's the spitting image of Ms. Hina... I wonder if they're blood relatives...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 07.ogg Hiroshi: Shh! Have you forgotten? We may not pry into Ms. Hina's identity!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 yuka 03.ogg Yuka: At least let's take a photo with him...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 08.ogg Hiroshi: Ahem. Friend, may we... take a photo with you?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 09.ogg Hiroshi: We borrowed a Kamera specifically to witness the official unveiling of Ms. Hina's image today...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Sure, that's fine.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), why do they want to take a picture with me?
 It's a Narukami Island custom!
 It's a quirky practice of the Yae Publishing House!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: Alright, sure...
People cluster around Gorou, and he takes a great many photos with them.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: That should do it... Right, I should really be heading to the Yae Publishing House to hand in those letters now.
 (Phew, managed to keep him in the dark...)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 kuroda 01.ogg Kuroda: Make way, everyone! Make way!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 kuroda 02.ogg Kuroda: The Ms. Hina billboard is here... Please, make some space, coming through!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 06.ogg Nobuhiro: Hey, everybody! It's the real Ms. Hina!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 10.ogg Hiroshi: Ms. Hina! Ms. Hina!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 15.ogg Gorou: Now I'm curious too... Let's go over and take a look, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
 No...
 You can't...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 16.ogg Gorou: Hmm? Why, what's the problem?
 I heard Yae Miko is about to come back!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 17.ogg Gorou: Really!? Then we can't stay, let's get out of here!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 18.ogg Gorou: As curious as I am to see what all the fuss is about... it'll have to wait until next time. So, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), please join me again the next time I'm delivering letters.

Toys and How to Play With Them[]
 Quest DescriptionFaruzan decides to come to the aid of Acara Crafts for the sake of the children and the Akademiya's future...

(Talk to Nadwah again at the Akademiya, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 nadwah 01.ogg Nadwah: Archon be praised, I can finally send a report to my superiors! Thank you so much!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 nadwah 02.ogg Nadwah: I have no idea how we might have persuaded her otherwise...
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Nadwah, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917301 nadwah 01.ogg Nadwah: (How did I end up getting myself into this...)
(Go to Port Ormos and look for Anis)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 anis 01.ogg Anis: Madam Faruzan...! It's really you! Did you... change your mind?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Alright, calm down. Let me be clear: I'm still not all that interested in Kshahrewar. I'm just here to see how the project is going.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: After all, you're here as representatives of the Akademiya in this collaboration. The reputation of all researchers is at stake here, so I will not simply stand by should mistakes get made.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 anis 02.ogg Anis: Haha... Either way, it's good that you were willing to come.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 anis 03.ogg Anis: Now, we've given Acara Crafts many ideas over the past couple of days. However, their owner thinks that our designs are too complicated, which will drive production costs too far up...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: That's expected. Students who have never had to deal with budgetary constraints probably don't understand how important it is to keep costs low. How enviable... Ahem!
 By any chance, has it been very difficult for you...
 ...To get funding for your research?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 anis 04.ogg Anis: If you join the Kshahrewar, your budget will be as big as you want it to be! I guarantee it.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: That's enough. I will not repeat myself. Take me to Acara Crafts' owner first, if you please.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 anis 05.ogg Anis: *sigh* ...Alright. He's usually at the slope up ahead recruiting volunteers to test out his toys. Let's just head over.
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Mamdouh, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917301 mamdouh 01.ogg Mamdouh: (Surely the kids will like this one...?)
(Talk to the staff at Acara Crafts)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 01.ogg Anis: Mamdouh, the one I recommended is here!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 01.ogg Mamdouh: Oh, so you're... uh, Madam Faruzan?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Yes, that's me.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 02.ogg Mamdouh: Ah, wonderful! We haven't been able to make any progress on our collaboration recently.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 03.ogg Mamdouh: We've made many suggestions, but Miss Anis thought that those ideas were too simple and wouldn't be effective in training the mind...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 02.ogg Anis: These early learning toys are meant to help the Akademiya train future researchers, after all. If they're too simple, then how are they any different from regular toys?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 04.ogg Mamdouh: But if they're too complicated, not only will they be expensive to produce considering our production capabilities, but they won't have much broad appeal to Sumeru's children, either.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: So the design can't be too complicated, but it can't be too easy to play with, either? Hmm...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 03.ogg Anis: I remember that, in your notes, many contraptions have managed to fulfill complex functions despite using simple parts. Maybe we can do something similar with these early learning toys...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: The contraptions in my notes? I didn't create those. I simply took the contraptions in the ruins apart and analyzed them.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: But now that you mention it, the ruins did have things like that. Do you have a pen, paper, and scissors? I'll make a paper prototype.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 05.ogg Mamdouh: You have an idea already? ... I suppose I should have expected as much of a respected Akademiya senior researcher. We do have those, yes. Please, help yourself!
Faruzan starts to sketch and cut...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 06.ogg Mamdouh: Oh, you're done already?

Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: Let me explain. These three thick lines represent three poles.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: These paper strips of varying lengths represent rings of different sizes. They can be slotted onto the poles and stacked up like a tower.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 07.ogg Mamdouh: Well... That is easier to make than I expected. So, how is this game played?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: That's very simple as well. You just need to shift the "tower" from this pole to another pole.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 04.ogg Anis: Um, isn't this a little too simple? Even by the standards of an early learning toy, I mean...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: Of course, when moving each "ring," the paper strips in this case, you must follow one rule: You can only move one ring at a time, and you can't place a bigger ring on top of a smaller one.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: It's like building a tower. The rings in the three poles must be stacked from big to small. I name this toy... "Pagoda Stack."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 05.ogg Anis: Hmm, Pagoda Stack...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 08.ogg Mamdouh: That sounds way too simple. Even I feel like it's missing something.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: Give it a try and you'll find out if it's simple or not. I heard from Anis that you find volunteers to try out the toys, right? Why don't we do the same for this game?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 09.ogg Mamdouh: It's such a simple toy. There's no need to...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 06.ogg Anis: Mamdouh, let's just do as she says.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 10.ogg Mamdouh: Huh? Okay then...
Mamdouh gathers the nearby volunteers over, and Faruzan explains the rules to them...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: And that's how you play this game. You can all give it a try. Let's see who's able to move the "tower" to another pole in the smallest number of steps.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 01.ogg Qasit: You called everyone here for such a simple toy?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 01.ogg Alia: It doesn't look like it'll take that many steps...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 ruhi 01.ogg Ruhi: Come on, we all promised to help Mr. Mamdouh test out the new toys. He said he'd give us new Genius Invokation TCG cards!
 So they were lured in by the promise of a different toy...
 So they were lured in by the promise of new cards...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 02.ogg Qasit: Ugh... fine. Let's get this over and done with so we can head back and play cards.
The children start to play with Pagoda Stack...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 ruhi 02.ogg Ruhi: ...Done. It took me 19 steps.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 02.ogg Alia: Huh? It took me over 20 steps!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 03.ogg Qasit: Hehe, I only needed 18 steps!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: Not bad! Looks like you're all familiar with the rules now.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: Then, let's increase the difficulty. The next "tower" will be five layers tall. Now then, give it a shot.

Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 03.ogg Alia: Wait, there's more?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 04.ogg Qasit: Well, since we're already here, why don't we just give it a try?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 ruhi 03.ogg Ruhi: An extra layer shouldn't make it that much harder, right?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 05.ogg Qasit: ...What's going on? I've already moved over 30 steps, but I'm still not done yet.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 04.ogg Alia: Hehe, I'm almost done. Looks like I'm the faster one this time.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 ruhi 04.ogg Ruhi: Done! It took me 35 steps!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 06.ogg Qasit: What, how!?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 ruhi 05.ogg Ruhi: This "Pagoda Stack" toy is pretty fun to play with!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 14.ogg Faruzan: Good. We'll try it one final time. This time, we'll add two more layers, making seven layers in total.

Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 15.ogg Faruzan: Mamdouh, we've still got quite a few paper strips here. Why don't you give this a go as well?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 11.ogg Mamdouh: Do you need that many steps for something this simple? Let me try!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 07.ogg Anis: Madam Faruzan... allow me to try it as well!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 16.ogg Faruzan: You were looking at it quite seriously just now. Are you starting to understand the principles involved?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 08.ogg Anis: I... think so?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 17.ogg Faruzan: If you want to test out your hypothesis, you'll just have to play and find out!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 09.ogg Anis: Got it!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 18.ogg Faruzan: Ah. We don't have enough paper strips left for you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). However, by the looks of things, you seem to have the game figured out.
 Somewhat.
 Just about.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 19.ogg Faruzan: Why don't you guess what the lowest number of steps needed to solve a seven-layer "Pagoda Stack" is?
 100 steps.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 21.ogg Faruzan: What a shame. You were close. However, you did well for someone seeing "Pagoda Stack" for the first time.
 108 steps.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 21.ogg Faruzan: What a shame. You were close. However, you did well for someone seeing "Pagoda Stack" for the first time.
 127 steps.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 20.ogg Faruzan: Oh? Color me impressed. You figured it out so quickly!
 136 steps.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 21.ogg Faruzan: What a shame. You were close. However, you did well for someone seeing "Pagoda Stack" for the first time.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 22.ogg Faruzan: Let's see how well they do, then.
After some time...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 12.ogg Mamdouh: If I move this small ring, then the big one won't be able to go on top of it. This is going to take more steps than I expected...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 07.ogg Qasit: I—I've lost count of how many steps I've taken! Can I restart?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 05.ogg Alia: This got a lot harder...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 10.ogg Anis: Hmm...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 11.ogg Anis: I solved it! Madam Faruzan, it takes 127 steps in total!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 13.ogg Mamdouh: That many? But there are only seven layers!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 12.ogg Anis: For every extra layer in the Pagoda Stack, the move order you need to consider becomes much more complex, and the number of steps required will at least double...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 23.ogg Faruzan: More accurately, it will require double the steps, plus one each time. You did well. You didn't underestimate the "principles" behind it just because it's an early learning toy.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 24.ogg Faruzan: The complexity of any given contraption isn't determined by the number of parts it has. The way the parts interact and the rules behind how it operates are important too.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 13.ogg Anis: Oh, I see. No wonder you emphasized in your notes that no contraption should ever be underestimated.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 14.ogg Mamdouh: I see. So even a simple toy can become complex with the right set of rules...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 25.ogg Faruzan: That's right. The rules used for "Pagoda Stack" are the simplest kind when it comes to ancient contraption-making techniques.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 26.ogg Faruzan: I could spend some time picking out all those machines that do something similar and write you a reference book.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 27.ogg Faruzan: Once that happens, you can give the volunteers the reference book and paper prototypes, and find out which toy is the most popular.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 06.ogg Alia: Do you have any other toys?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 08.ogg Qasit: Yeah, when can we play with them?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 28.ogg Faruzan: Uh, in about two days or so, I think. Anis, if you're free, can you help me with the illustrations for the reference book?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 14.ogg Anis: Of course! I'd be honored!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 15.ogg Mamdouh: Two days should be enough for us to find more volunteers. Then, we can organize a huge conference here, at which we can announce which toy we'll be making.
 Should I come back in two days, then?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 16.ogg Mamdouh: You'd be most welcome! We need more people to get a healthy range of opinions. The more, the merrier!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 29.ogg Faruzan: Thank you for coming here with me today. I'll walk back with you.
(Talk to Mamdouh again)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 mamdouh 01.ogg Mamdouh: No wonder she's so well-respected at the Akademiya. When I first saw her, I thought she might be unreliable because she's so young...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 mamdouh 02.ogg Mamdouh: Ah! Don't let her know I said that. Anis warned me about that before...
(Talk to Anis again)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 anis 01.ogg Anis: Is Madam Faruzan really going to mentor me? What an honor!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 anis 02.ogg Anis: Ah, I'm sure she'll say "helping with illustrations isn't mentoring"... So, ah, don't tell her I said that.
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Anis, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917301 anis 01.ogg Anis: (Ah, if only Madam Faruzan were willing to switch to Kshahrewar... *sigh*)
(Talk to Qasit, Ruhi, or Alia again)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 qasit 01.ogg Qasit: We need to wait two whole days before we get the new toys...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 ruhi 01.ogg Ruhi: It might just be all reference stuff. It'll be a loooong time before we can play with the real toys.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 alia 01.ogg Alia: Guess all we can do is play Genius Invokation TCG in the meantime...
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Anis, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917301 alia 01.ogg Alia: (This new game's not bad, but Genius Invokation TCG is better...)

Question and Answer Time[]
 Step DescriptionFaruzan decides to come to the aid of Acara Crafts for the sake of the children and the Akademiya's future...

Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: I'll be going then. Say hi to Tighnari and Collei for me if you can. Once everything here is settled, I'll make my way over to Pardis Dhyai as quickly as I can.
 So, about Kshahrewar...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: You want to ask why I'm unwilling to join them, yes?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: Putting aside the fact that they're too full of themselves, I actually have no issue with their research methodologies and approach.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: After all, knowledge is either right or wrong. Superiority and inferiority do not come into the conversation. All researchers are just doing their best to shed light on the unknown in their respective fields of expertise.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: No matter what corner of the unknown they shed light on, it's a step forward for us all.
 Then why do you refuse to join them?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: Because I believe wholeheartedly in that principle.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: Even if the others call my research "useless," as long as the knowledge I gain from it is accurate, it could become useful in the future.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: In the end, "useful" and "useless" are concepts that shouldn't be used to evaluate knowledge.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: When I first started deciphering ancient documents, I didn't think about how it'd be "useful" to Kshahrewar.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: That's why there's no need for me to join them to do "useful" research. I'd rather stay in Haravatat. It's much more convenient for me to access the materials I need for my research here.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: *sigh* ... Still, the funding that Kshahrewar has offered me is so hard to get in Haravatat...
 Oh yeah, about Anis...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: Anis? We haven't had much time to get to know each other, but she seems like a good kid.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: She's able to calmly figure out the basic principles behind something without being influenced by others.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 14.ogg Faruzan: I'll do my best to teach her over the next few days... Still, how much she learns will really depend on her.
 Why don't you take her on as your student?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 15.ogg Faruzan: Well, her interest lies in the application of mechanisms.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 16.ogg Faruzan: I do have some old knowledge to share, but if we think about the future, it's easier for her to learn the things she's interested in if she stays in Kshahrewar.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 17.ogg Faruzan: My research into mechanisms is, in a sense, a side effect of my research into ancient texts.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 18.ogg Faruzan: If she becomes my student to learn how to make modern contraptions, it wouldn't benefit either of us in the long run.
 I see. I hadn't considered that.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 19.ogg Faruzan: However, if she develops an interest in deciphering ancient texts over these next two days, that would change things.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 20.ogg Faruzan: If I successfully poach a student... those young punks at Haravatat will have one less reason to cut my budget!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 21.ogg Faruzan: Perhaps if this collaborative project goes smoothly, I can even ignore Haravatat and ask for a higher budget directly from the Akademiya...
 About the collaborative project...
 Do you have any ideas?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 22.ogg Faruzan: Oh, I could come up with lots of ideas. With Anis's help, two days will be enough for our work. However, I'm still undecided as to the style of the reference book's text and illustrations...
 Try to be accurate and detailed?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 23.ogg Faruzan: You're right. Explanations are a core part of early development, too.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 24.ogg Faruzan: By using detailed and accurate illustrations, we can impart knowledge more effectively. It would also make it easier for me to recruit students.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 25.ogg Faruzan: Thank you! I'll take your opinion into account. See you in two days.
(Proceed to A Failed Reference Book...?)
 Try to keep it simple and fun?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 26.ogg Faruzan: You're right. If no one understands the reference book, it doesn't matter how detailed it is.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 27.ogg Faruzan: It's better to make it simpler and fun so that children will be interested in the subject. It'll also make it easier for me to recruit students in the long run...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 28.ogg Faruzan: Thank you! I'll take your opinion into account. See you in two days.
(Proceed to Potential Students...?)
(Talk to Tighnari at Pardis Dhyai before waiting until 2 days later, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Have you met with Madam Faruzan yet?
 Yes. She's still kinda busy...
 She needs about two more days...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: It's fine. Collei has already filled me in, more or less.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: I've also managed to settle some of the problems on my side, so I've got time to wait for Madam Faruzan to arrive.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Can you help me find out how she's faring in two days' time?
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Tighnari, optional)

A Failed Reference Book...?[]
 Step DescriptionFaruzan decided to make the reference book as detailed as possible... Will she be able to pique the children's interest?

(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Faruzan, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917301 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: (Will I finally be able to attract some students?)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 anis 01.ogg Anis: Oh? You're here! We're just starting to set up the venue.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 mamdouh 01.ogg Mamdouh: We've called up everyone we possibly could have. This is going to be quite the event!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Hehe. My masterpiece is going to be exhibited, after all. Let's see what the Akademiya shall say about it this time!
The grand and lively event gets underway...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: ...To sum up, the 24 forms of pressure-based puzzle mechanisms were used in various ruins...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: Alright, let's go to the next page. Now, I'll explain the base layer design of Elemental Monuments.
 How did things turn out like this?
 I feel like I'm in class...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 qasit 01.ogg Qasit: *yawn* Are we done yet? I'm falling asleep...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 alia 01.ogg Alia: I don't understand any of it at all...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 ruhi 01.ogg Ruhi: *snore*
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 servan 01.ogg Servan: Are these really toys?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 nazenin 01.ogg Nazenin: They sound a bit too dangerous to buy for children...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 01.ogg Kamal: Oh...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 mamdouh 02.ogg Mamdouh: Uh, well, we've prepared paper prototypes for everyone. If you're interested in the mechanisms Madam Faruzan's talked about, you're more than welcome to try them out!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 qasit 02.ogg Qasit: This is no fun. Can I try another toy?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 alia 02.ogg Alia: I wanna go home and play Genius Invokation TCG...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 ruhi 02.ogg Ruhi: *snore*
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 servan 02.ogg Servan: Forget it. I don't think anyone would be interested...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 nazenin 02.ogg Nazenin: I should go home and take care of my children...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 02.ogg Kamal: Hmm...
The launch event ends on that note...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 mamdouh 03.ogg Mamdouh: How did this happen...? Forget about getting opinions from others. No one even wanted to stay and try them out...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 anis 02.ogg Anis: I'm sorry. I think we miscalculated...
 I must apologize, too...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: No, you simply gave suggestions. I was the one who decided to follow through. Anis, too, was only following my instructions.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: I will find a way to make up for this error. Please give me some time. I'll write another reference book...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 03.ogg Kamal: Excuse me, but are you the one who wrote this reference book?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: Uh, yes. Who are you?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 mamdouh 04.ogg Mamdouh: Ah, you're that man-mountain who was in the crowd just now!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 04.ogg Kamal: Haha, do I stand out that much? Well, I guess I don't look like someone who'd have anything to do with toys...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 05.ogg Kamal: Let me introduce myself. I'm Kamal, the Branch Master of Sumeru's Adventurers' Guild.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 anis 03.ogg Anis: What's the Branch Master doing here? Were you looking for us, or did something happen?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 06.ogg Kamal: Ah, I came to Port Ormos to visit some old friends. On the way over, I saw the booklet you all were handing out, so I came to take a look.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 07.ogg Kamal: Can you print a few more copies of this booklet and sell them to the Adventurers' Guild? Also, could you make full-fledged models of those paper prototypes and sell them to us as well?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 mamdouh 05.ogg Mamdouh: What does the Adventurers' Guild want with these toys?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 08.ogg Kamal: You may see them as toys, but to adventurers who need to deal with all sorts of machines and contraptions within ancient ruins, this booklet is a true treasure!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 09.ogg Kamal: We have many members who can't read, so books are of little use to them. What they know of handling mechanisms has been learned solely through word-of-mouth.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 10.ogg Kamal: Even if the Akademiya granted public access to all their books, there are people who can't use them...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 anis 04.ogg Anis: Ah, and our booklet is practically all pictures!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: Well, it IS designed for children...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 11.ogg Kamal: It might be a bit too difficult for children, but it's perfect for adventurers. Also, those paper strips... Uh, you called them paper prototypes?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 12.ogg Kamal: If you can make wooden versions for demonstration purposes, even the most illiterate person would be able to follow along and understand.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 13.ogg Kamal: If we can supply a model set for each branch and if each adventurer carries a booklet with them, then ruin exploration will become much safer!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: Y—You really think so? *cough* I mean, yes, yes, I always knew it! Knowledge will always be needed one way or another!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 mamdouh 06.ogg Mamdouh: Making models of contraptions for the Adventurers' Guild? To be honest, that sounds like a good avenue to explore to me.
 Will there be an issue with the Akademiya?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 anis 05.ogg Anis: Uh, we'll probably have to send in a separate application, but it shouldn't be an issue.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 anis 06.ogg Anis: After all, this concerns safety during the exploration of ruins. It's a problem that the Akademiya is actually trying to address as well...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 14.ogg Kamal: Then let's cut to the chase and discuss the details of our first order. The amount we're offering to pay in advance is...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 15.ogg Kamal: ...This much.

Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 alia 01.ogg Alia: If the mechanism was bigger, you could make a rabbit appear, right?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 ruhi 02.ogg Ruhi: Then you can't use a cane. Could you switch it out with a hat or something?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: You're applying what you learned creatively. Not bad.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: Let's look at the next page. If you fold an origami bird like this, it'll fly further and more stably...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 qasit 02.ogg Qasit: Whoa... you can make a mechanism using just a piece of paper?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: Hehe. The "principles" at play are even more important than the parts that make up a mechanism.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 servan 01.ogg Servan: These are pretty cool. I'm tempted to try them out.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 nazenin 01.ogg Nazenin: I'm not that interested in toys, but if they'll be beneficial for children's development...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 mamdouh 02.ogg Mamdouh: Everyone, we have paper prototypes and craft materials that you can use to make your own toys! Come try them out!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 servan 02.ogg Servan: This is such a well-prepared event! I'll give it a go.

Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: Ahem! Just "Madam" will do. Maybe, in the future, you may indeed get the chance to call me "Professor"...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: You may wish to pay attention to these few details. Here, for example... Alright, try it again.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 ruhi 05.ogg Ruhi: Wow! It really did fly farther!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 alia 02.ogg Alia: Madam Faruzan, will we learn origami at the Akademiya?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: Of course you will. If you become a researcher, you can explore any field you like to your hearts' content.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: In the future, if you want, you can even become one of my students...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 alia 03.ogg Alia: But Mom and Dad said that there are six Darshans in the Akademiya... Wait, was it seven?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 alia 04.ogg Alia: Which Darshan teaches about mechanisms and origami?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: Well, uh, in this case, it wouldn't be Haravatat...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 qasit 04.ogg Qasit: I know! We need to choose Kshahrewar!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: Huh!?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 qasit 05.ogg Qasit: I want to attend Kshahrewar in the future and fold even better origami birds!

 Looks like these early learning toys are a success.
 However, looks like recruiting students might be an issue...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 14.ogg Faruzan: How did this happen...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 alia 05.ogg Alia: What if we end up in a Darshan we don't like? Does that mean that we won't get to learn about the things we do like?

Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 16.ogg Faruzan: *sigh* No, that won't happen. Take me for example. I'm a researcher from Haravatat, but I research mechanisms, see?

 Quest DescriptionNoelle reveals to you that she is very anxious about the Knights of Favonius selection exam. At your suggestion, she decides to join you on a trip to Liyue to relieve her stress...
Levity in Liyue[]

Media:vo noecop002 1908201 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: I can't believe I have really come all the way to Liyue...
Media:vo noecop002 1908201 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Wow... The architecture here is so unique, and there are so many people around... But somehow, I feel like I'm constantly being watched...
 Well, you do look especially good today.
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo noecop002 1908201 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: No~ Please don't make fun of me.
 Well, Knights of Favonius are a rare sight around here.
(−1 Heart)
Media:vo noecop002 1908201 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Oh, I am not a Knight of Favonius yet...
Media:vo noecop002 1908201 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Tsk, you shouldn't make jokes like that in public, people may hear you and get the wrong idea.
Media:vo noecop002 1908201 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Huh, how strange... Back in Mondstadt, I never feel shy around strangers, but over here I feel so tense...
Media:vo noecop002 1908201 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: I—It's probably because I'm in a completely different environment. I don't know how I should act to make sure I don't make a fool of myself...
Media:vo noecop002 1908201 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: And speaking of... I heard that it's customary to eat with chopsticks in Liyue...
Media:vo noecop002 1908201 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Back in Mondstadt, I have previously provided chopsticks to visitors from Liyue, but I have never used them myself... Ohh, I hope I won't become a laughing stock...
 Some foods here can be eaten without chopsticks. Want to have a look?
 I can teach you how to use chopsticks. Want to try?
Media:vo noecop002 1908201 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: Huh? Oh, I... I was just thinking aloud. Don't worry about it.
Media:vo noecop002 1908201 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: My time here in Liyue is precious. I should make good use of it to study...
 You never know, the exam may test your ability to work with partners from Liyue.
(−1 Heart)
Media:vo noecop002 1908201 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Wh—What? Could that really come up in the exam? Wait, you're right... maybe it will!
 Understanding the local culture will help you connect with people and learn more.
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo noecop002 1908201 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: Hmm, true... If I offended the locals by not knowing their customs, I wouldn't have the chance to learn from them...
Media:vo noecop002 1908201 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: Huh, then... okay... Let's start by learning about the local cuisine. (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), do you have any suggestions?
 You can trust me with this.
 Let's go to Wanmin Restaurant.
Media:vo noecop002 1908201 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: Okay! (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), if it comes recommended by you, I'm excited to find out what kind of food it is...
(Go to Wanmin Restaurant)
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 01.ogg Chef Mao: If it isn't the Traveler! What would you like to order today? Wanmin Restuarant will cook it just how you like it!
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 02.ogg Chef Mao: Oh, is this a new customer you've brought with you? Based on Madam's attire... it would appear that...
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 03.ogg Chef Mao: ...Even a Knight of Favonius will travel all the way to Liyue just to try Wanmin Restaurant's cooking!
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Knight of Favonius? Oh... I—I'm not...
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 04.ogg Chef Mao: Haha, I'm just joking, of course. You must be in Liyue on official business?
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 05.ogg Chef Mao: But anyway, while you're here in Liyue, I can confidently say that you won't regret stopping by Wanmin Restaurant to try our tasty dishes!
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: That... that's not what I meant...
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 06.ogg Chef Mao: Not what you meant... Oh, I see... I suppose you must be looking for Liuli Pavilion or Xinyue Kiosk?
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 07.ogg Chef Mao: *sigh* Most first-time visitors have only heard of these two places. I just didn't expect the Knights of Favonius to be the same way...
 Chef Mao... that's not what she meant...
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Wh—What I meant was... I am not an official Knight of Favonius. I'm just a knight-in-training currently serving as a maid...
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 08.ogg Chef Mao: Goodness... They really distinguish between knights to that degree? Well, anyway, as long as you dine at Wanmin Restaurant, rest assured you will leave here a satisfied customer!
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 09.ogg Chef Mao: Since this is your first time in Liyue, perhaps you are not used to chopsticks yet? If so, might I recommend the Grilled Tiger Fish — fresh, fragrant, and easy to eat...
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 10.ogg Chef Mao: If I tone down the spice a little, it should be perfect for the Mondstadt palate. Want to try it?
 Noelle, what do you think?
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Um... I want to learn about the Liyue diet. Adjusting the dish to accommodate what I'm used to seems to defeat the purpose of coming here...
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 11.ogg Chef Mao:  Oh? You want to try something with more of a local flavor? Well, in that case, you've got to try our signature dish: Black-Back Perch Stew!
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 12.ogg Chef Mao: The only thing is, you can't really eat it without using chopsticks, and the level of spice is not for everyone.
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 13.ogg Chef Mao: I pour oil into a hot pan, throw in a big handful of Jueyun Chilis, and stir-fry them to release the flavor. Then, I sprinkle in some powdered Violetgrass to enhance the spiciness...
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Phew! I can already feel the spiciness just by listening to your description! ...Will I be able to handle it?
 Come on, you can do it!
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: ...Right! I can't give up so soon!
 Don't force it if you're not going to enjoy it.
(−1 Heart)
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: But if I give up so soon... how can I learn to overcome future obstacles?
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Hmm... It's just a harmless bit of chili pepper... I—I can take it!
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Chef Mao, I will go with your recommendation!
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 14.ogg Chef Mao: Haha, great! Please have a seat. One Black-Back Perch Stew, coming right up!
You and Noelle dine on Black-Back Perch Stew together...
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: *cough* *cough* *cough* So spicy... I can't even hold... my chopsticks steadily... *cough* *cough*
 Are you okay...?
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: I'm fine... I'm fine... It's certainly very spicy, but once you get over that, it' quite delicious...
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: What surprised me is how the freshness of the fish still shines through, despite how heavily seasoned the dish is...
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: Hmm... the next time I entertain guests from Liyue... I wonder if I'll be able to prepare such delicious food for them...
 Your cooking is delicious, too.
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: R—Really? Then, let me bake some muffins for you when we get back...
 Liyue cuisine is in a league of its own.
(−1 Heart)
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: So... So this is the kind of food you like? After I get back, I will have to study it properly...
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 15.ogg Chef Mao: Wow, you've already finished? How do you feel? Even locals rarely finish the dish so quickly...
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: Oh, it was very good! Thank you, Chef Mao.
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 16.ogg Chef Mao: Ah, you're very welcome! Seeing customers satisfied is my greatest pleasure.
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 chefmao 17.ogg Chef Mao: But... I must say, I really didn't expect you to drink the soup! It's so spicy that most people here in Liyue can't even handle it.
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: Wha— The soup...? W—We weren't supposed to drink it!?
 Ahem... Time to move on.
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: Oh, um... Yes. Let's.
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: *sigh*... Next time I eat in Liyue, I'll be sure to check how each dish is meant to be consumed first...
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 20.ogg Noelle: Oh... That sounds like ironwork going on over there. Is it a blacksmith?
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 21.ogg Noelle: ...From the kind of weapons made here, I should be able to learn something about the local combat style. Will you come with me to the blacksmith, so I can take a look?
 You mean Hanfeng's Ironmongers? Sure, follow me.
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 22.ogg Noelle: Oh, great!
Media:vo noecop002 1908202 noelle 23.ogg Noelle: ...It's almost like you're the host and I'm your guest. As a maid... I can't help but feel a little guilty!

Liyue Local Weaponry[]

(Go to Hanfeng's Ironmongers)
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Wow, just from looking at these weapons, I can tell they have great power. This is the nation built by the Geo Archon, after all...
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: I wonder how Favonius Bladework could be applied to these weapons, and what kind of modifications would be needed...
 Seems like you are getting some inspiration?
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Yes... And even though I am just thinking through problems as I always do, I don't feel as nervous as I did when I was in Mondstadt...
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 dugushuo 01.ogg Dugu Shuo: Hey! You over there! What are you doing?
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Ah? What's wrong, little boy?
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 dugushuo 02.ogg Dugu Shuo: Wh—Who're you calling "little boy"? I'm a mighty warrior! I see you, with your strange attire, acting all mysterious, loitering around the Ironmongers... Yeah, you're up to no good!
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: *gasp* I'm not up to anything...
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 dugushuo 03.ogg Dugu Shuo: Hmph! You can't hide it from me! I see the way you look at those weapons... Same way I look at 'em too!
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 dugushuo 04.ogg Dugu Shuo: You must be planning to sneak over and steal a couple of blades when the man's not looking, huh? Well, I'm warning you. Quit while you're ahead! Stop before you do something you'll regret! 'Cause if you get caught, uh... that man is gonna yell at you!
 She's a Knight of Favonius. She wouldn't do such a thing.
(−1 Heart)
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Honorary Knight, please... I told you not to call me that...
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 dugushuo 05.ogg Dugu Shuo: Knight of Favonius? Huh... Then she's no small fry after all...
 She has her own weapon already, she wouldn't need to.
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Yes, that's right. In any case, my weapon of choice is the greatsword... And I don't see any of those here.
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 dugushuo 06.ogg Dugu Shuo: Greatsword, huh... Well, you got one thing right: The man refuses to show anyone his greatsword in the store, no matter how many times you beg him. Trust me, I would know...
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 dugushuo 07.ogg Dugu Shuo: But let's not get ahead of ourselves here, I still don't think I can trust you! Unless... unless you show me your greatsword, and also your Vision!
 Oh, so that's what you're really after.
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 dugushuo 08.ogg Dugu Shuo: Th—That's not true! No greatsword can outshine the mighty Dugu Longsword! And one day... I'm gonna get my Geo Vision! So... I'm not jealous! Who said anything about being jealous? Hmph!
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: The cat is out of the bag... *sigh* Alright then, if you insist...
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Um... Please be careful with them. Don't hurt yourself.
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 dugushuo 09.ogg Dugu Shuo: You... You're really gonna let me have a look? Wow, you're so nice!
Dugu Shuo carefully studies Noelle's weapon and Vision...
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 dugushuo 10.ogg Dugu Shuo: Wow... That glow, it really is a Geo Vision... And this sword is so heavy... I can't hold it...
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 dugushuo 11.ogg Dugu Shuo: Ugh... It's not fair. If only I were a bit bigger...
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: Be patient. You'll get there.
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Besides, I'm sure your dream will come true one day.
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 dugushuo 12.ogg Dugu Shuo: Uh... hmph. It's clear to me now. You bear a Geo Vision... You wield a greatsword... You're a nice person from Mondstadt...
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 dugushuo 13.ogg Dugu Shuo: ...You must be a fabled Knight of Favonius!
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: ...Huh?
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 dugushuo 14.ogg Dugu Shuo: Hmph! I must accept that the Knights of Favonius of Mondstadt live up to their name... But I shall not concede defeat!
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 dugushuo 15.ogg Dugu Shuo: As surely as the hills are green and the rivers flow into the sea... our paths will cross again!
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: Wait... I...
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: Ohh, he's gone... I do hope there are no further misunderstandings today.
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: Children in Liyue have these dreams too. I never would have thought...
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: When I was little, the other Mondstadt kids and I always used to imagine what kind of Visions we would have when we grew up... I hope that, someday, this boy's dreams will come true, too...
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: Anyway, what's next? Should we visit Liyue's harbor, or take a short break?
 The harbor. We may learn something from the Millelith.
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: Yes, there does seem to be a large number of Millelith stationed at the harbor. It would be great if I can learn something from them.
(Proceed to While the Millelith Stands Guard)
 Let's head to Third-Round Knockout, then keep exploring.
Media:vo noecop002 1908203 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: Yes, if we plan to explore further, let's take a short break first.

 Quest DescriptionNoelle is mistaken for a Knight of Favonius several times over the course of the trip. After things have calmed down a little, you decide to see what Noelle could learn from the Millelith down by the harbor.Down at the dock, you and Noelle meet Sha'yin, a Millelith seeking the assistance of the Knights of Favonius. You follow him to Stone Gate to help with the arrest of some Treasure hoarders on the Run.It seems that Noelle wants to spend some quality time with you before you both head back to Mondstadt.
Crook-Catching Commission[]

Media:vo noecop002 1908301 shayin 01.ogg ???: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail. Wow, it's good to finally meet you two.
 You've been looking for us?
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 shayin 02.ogg ???: Yes. Word is that a Knight of Favonius has appeared in Liyue. That's why I came to have a look. I never expected that one of you would be the honored guest of the Qixing. And the other one...
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 shayin 03.ogg ???: ...Must be the rumored Knight of Favonius.
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Oh, um... Sorry, I am not yet a Knight...
 Here's the situation...
You explain the situation to the Millelith...
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 shayin 04.ogg ???: I see, I see. Please excuse me for the misunderstanding.
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 shayin 05.ogg Sha'yin: Allow me to introduce myself first. My name is Sha'yin, a Millelith responsible for garrison and patrol duties.
 I am (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), a traveler.
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: And I am Noelle, maid of the Knights of Favonius... Of course, I am not yet an official Knight.
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 shayin 06.ogg Sha'yin: Understood. Allow me to apologize on behalf of all the residents of this area for the misunderstanding earlier.
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: It's no big deal. More importantly — is there a reason why you were looking for a Knight of Favonius? May I be of any assistance?
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 shayin 07.ogg Sha'yin: Well... Let me fill you in. I just received some intel that a group of Treasure Hoarders, originally from Mondstadt, has shown up in this area recently.
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 shayin 08.ogg Sha'yin: According to the intel, they have set up camp near Stone Gate. If we act too rashly and let them escape back to Mondstadt, then it will be difficult for the Millelith to continue pursuing them.
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 shayin 09.ogg Sha'yin: That's why I was hoping the Knight of Favonius could join me in the arrest, so we could act as each others' witnesses. But it seems like this is easier said than done...
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: I'm sorry... If only I could have passed the selection exam earlier...
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 shayin 10.ogg Sha'yin: Uhh... If I submitted an official request for assistance to the Knights of Favonius, all I would achieve is to buy the Treasure Hoarders time to plan their escape... Might I ask if there are any other Knights of Favonius in Liyue Harbor at present?
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Hmm, any other Knights in Liyue... Oh! Of course! If it's a knight you need, well, there's one right here!
 Now you mention it... I am technically an Honorary Knight.
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 shayin 11.ogg Sha'yin: An honored guest of the Qixing, and an Honorary Knight, too... Well, if someone who's independently a hero in two different nations is willing to lend me a hand, I can't exactly do better than that... It's just that...
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 shayin 12.ogg Sha'yin: ...I feel a little ashamed calling on a hero who defeats ancient gods to assist with something so trivial.
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Wait, so... (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), as well as Stormterror... you defeated an ancient god, too?
 It's honestly no trouble.
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 shayin 13.ogg Sha'yin: Then I am truly honored! Please excuse me while I catch up with my comrades stationed at Stone Gate. I will confirm the details of the arrest with them. Whenever the two of you are ready, please come and find me there.
Media:vo noecop002 1908301 shayin 14.ogg Sha'yin: Let's rendezvous shortly. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail.
(Head near Stone Gate)
Media:vo noecop002 1908302 shayin 01.ogg Sha'yin: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail. Thank you both for your help. We've confirmed the location of the Treasure Hoarders and we will move out shortly.
Media:vo noecop002 1908302 shayin 02.ogg Sha'yin: In case any of them slip through our grasp and try to escape to Mondstadt, we will need someone to guard this path.
Media:vo noecop002 1908302 shayin 03.ogg Sha'yin: As I said earlier, it would not be appropriate for the Millelith to take action here, so I will have to rely on you two.
Media:vo noecop002 1908302 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Um... Though I am not a Knight of Favonius yet... May I still help in some capacity?
Media:vo noecop002 1908302 shayin 04.ogg Sha'yin: Oh, I only asked the Honorary Knight here to act as a witness. There are no specific restrictions over how the arrest is carried out. So please, there's no need to feel apprehensive about your involvement.
Media:vo noecop002 1908302 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: If that's the case, I... I shall be glad to help to the fullest extend that I am able.
 I'll help too.
Media:vo noecop002 1908302 shayin 05.ogg Sha'yin: Then I will meet up with my comrades first. If the Treasure Hoarders try to escape, they will have to pass through here. So, I am counting on you two.
(Head to the location to stand guard)
Media:vo noecop002 1908303 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Um... (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), would you mind... letting me handle this mission?
 Noelle, you want to guard this place by yourself?
Media:vo noecop002 1908303 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Yes... If it hadn't been for you, I would not have been able to participate.
Media:vo noecop002 1908303 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: As expected, compared to the Honorary Knight, I still have a long way to go...
Media:vo noecop002 1908303 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: But I still want to do everything within my ability to share the load!
 I will stand by and watch. Try not to push yourself too hard.
Media:vo noecop002 1908303 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: As you wish! Then, leave it all to me!
(Treasure Hoarders appear)
Media:vo noecop002 1908303 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Ah, they're coming already! Facing them alone... Do I have what it takes?
(After defeating opponents)
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: I did it... I actually did it!
 Because you have what it takes.
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: No... It's all because of your encouragement... Otherwise, I...
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 shayin 01.ogg Sha'yin: Thank you! We've successfully detained all the Treasure Hoarders who tried to escape through here.
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 shayin 02.ogg Sha'yin: We've double checked the numbers against the intel we were given, and it looks like none of then escaped. ...Small wonder that you are the honored guest of the Qixing and Mondstadt's Honorary Knight...
 I actually did nothing.
 Noelle took care of it all.
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 shayin 03.ogg Sha'yin: Oh? It was Miss Noelle who defeated the Treasure Hoarders? Thank you so much!
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Y—You're quite welcome!
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: To be of help to you, Sir, and to the Millelith... It is my great honor.
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 shayin 04.ogg Sha'yin: You are too humble. I hear from the merchants that the Knights of Favonius of Mondstadt are both highly skilled and only too willing to rescue people in the direst of situations.
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 shayin 05.ogg Sha'yin: With the skills and integrity you've shown, it's no wonder that the residents of Chihu Rock mistook you for a real knight.
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Sadly they are quite mistaken! I am still far from becoming a real knight...
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 shayin 06.ogg Sha'yin: Heh, then I sincerely look forward to seeing you in action in the future, after you do become a real knight.
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 shayin 07.ogg Sha'yin: It's getting late. I should escort these Treasure Hoarders back. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail. Hope to meet you both again.
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Goodbye, Mr. Sha'yin!
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: A real knight... How much longer until I become worthy of this title...?
 We should probably head back, too.
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Oh, you're right... Wow, the time flew by so quickly...
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Is it really time to go back already?
 Noelle?
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: Apologies, I know that this is a lot to ask, but...
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: But could you... spend a little longer with me?
Media:vo noecop002 1908304 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: I still have somewhere that I'd like to visit.
(Head to the place Noelle wants to go)
Media:vo noecop002 1908305 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: This is the place.
 So you wanted to visit a tea stall.
Media:vo noecop002 1908305 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: That's right. I often make tea for the Knights of Favonius, so I wanted to come here and see what I can learn.
Media:vo noecop002 1908305 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), would you care to join me for some tea?
 Of course.
You and Noelle enjoy some of Liyue's tea together...
Media:vo noecop002 1908305 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: *blowing* ...Liyue's tea is certainly different from that of Mondstadt.
Media:vo noecop002 1908305 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Both the taste and the consistency are different, but the warm and soothing sense it brings me as I drink it... That feels the same.
Media:vo noecop002 1908305 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: When I read about the Knights of Favonius and the Millelith in books, their rules and philosophies seem to different...
Media:vo noecop002 1908305 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: But it seems the desire to protect one's own people is the same everywhere.
 Whether in Mondstadt or Liyue, everyone just wants to have a better future.
 And whether by Anemo or Geo, people will seek to protect what is most important.
Media:vo noecop002 1908305 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Yes, deep down, people everywhere are the same...
Media:vo noecop002 1908305 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), I don't think I'm so afraid of my exam anymore.
Media:vo noecop002 1908305 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: I know I still have a long way to go compared to the Honorary Knight — listening to your stories is like reading about myths and legends...
Media:vo noecop002 1908305 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: But still... This motivates me to work harder and look forward even more to the day when it finally comes...
Media:vo noecop002 1908305 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: ...The day that I can fight side by side with you as a knight.
Media:vo noecop002 1908305 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), let's come back to Liyue again... after my exam is over.

The Forgotten Cat[]

(Talk to Euphrasie)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918501 euphrasie 01.ogg Euphrasie: Every stupendous day starts with The Steambird! Oh, hi Lynette! Hi (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! What can I help you with?
 We wanted to ask about the latest "Tales of Humanity" column...
 Any commissions in there about a missing cat?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918501 euphrasie 02.ogg Euphrasie: Hmm, I don't think so... Have you picked up a stray?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918501 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: Yep. If there's no commission to follow up on, could we post a notice about the missing cat instead?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918501 euphrasie 03.ogg Euphrasie: Why, of course! What a kind thing to do! Just fill out the form.
Bonnie: Meow!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918501 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: Well, we've registered you as missing... You can stay at my place until your owner finds you.
Bonnie: Meeoow!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918501 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: Also I just wanted to say... Thanks... for keeping us company for so long.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918501 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: Well, I should probably head back to the drinks reception. Hopefully most of the people have left by now.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918501 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: If you've got some time, you should stop by my place tomorrow to see Bonnie. There's a nice cup of tea in it for you.
 Looking forward to it.
 I'll be there!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918501 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: Alright. See you then.

 Step DescriptionYou and Lynette have agreed on the time of your next meeting...

(Wait until 7:00 — 9:00)
(Approach Lynette)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 benoit 01.ogg Bernard: ...I believe this cat belongs to me...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 01.ogg Elodie: ...I already told you — this isn't your cat!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: ...Just take a breather, you two...
Bonnie: Meow...
 What's going on?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: Oh, you're here... As you can probably see... You'll have to take a raincheck on that tea I promised you — at least for now.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 02.ogg Elodie: ...This is my friend's cat! He's preoccupied with some important business, so I came to retrieve her in his stead.
(Passive Check succeeds)

(Insight Check Success) This lady's expression seems a bit unnatural...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (The way she speaks is loud and authoritative... It's like she's deliberately using her tone of voice to dispel any doubts about her integrity.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 benoit 02.ogg Bernard: ...No, no. It's far more likely this cat, uh... escaped from the Humane Society.
(Passive Check succeeds)

(Insight Check Success) This gentleman's expression seems a bit unnatural...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (The hesitation in his voice... It seems like he could be hiding something. His gaze keeps drifting off to the side. It's like he's trying to not draw attention to himself.)
 How about... we let Bonnie decide?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 benoit 03.ogg Bernard: Bonnie...?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: Ah, that's the name I've given her in the meantime.
Bonnie: Meow!
 [Animal Handling] (Let's see who Bonnie decides to approach...)
(If the card drawn is less than 8)

Bonnie: Meow...
Bonnie instantly runs to hide behind Lynette, poking her head out ever so slightly to assess the situation...
(If the card drawn is greater than or equal to 8)

Bonnie: Meow!
Bonnie happily runs up to you and begins to weave through your legs...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: Well, this complicates things...
 I didn't think she'd be so attached to you.
 This is no way to tell who her owner is...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 03.ogg Elodie: *sigh*... I told you before. This is my friend's cat. It's normal for her not to trust me.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 benoit 04.ogg Bernard: Listen... I'm the director of the Humane Society, okay? We've got so many strays... dogs, cats — you name it. I'm not even the one feeding them most of the time... You can hardly expect the cat to recognize me...
 ...Then how are you so sure she belongs to you?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 benoit 05.ogg Bernard: She just... looked somewhat familiar, so I came to check just in case.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 benoit 06.ogg Bernard: If she turns out to be one of ours, I'll take her back, simple as that. Even if that's not the case, the Humane Society could still take her in — if no one else comes to claim her, that is.
 What's the Humane Society?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 benoit 07.ogg Bernard: Ah, we're an organization that specializes in rescuing and sheltering stray animals. We've been in business for several decades now! I'm Bernard, the current director.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: The Humane Society... Huh, the name sounds familiar. I remember hearing good things. You're the one in the Quartier Lyonnais?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 benoit 08.ogg Bernard: Yes, yes! That's the one! Anyway, um, if it's not too much trouble, could I possibly take a closer look at the cat?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 benoit 09.ogg Bernard: If it turns out I really am mistaken, I suppose that means the cat belongs to this lady here — she would be the only remaining option, after all.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 04.ogg Elodie: ...It belongs to my friend!
 (With us here to keep watch... it should be fine...)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: Go on, Bonnie.
Bonnie: Meow...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 benoit 10.ogg Bernard: Hmmm...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 benoit 11.ogg Bernard: ...Ah, nope. Looks like I was mistaken. They do look similar, but there's an ever so slight difference in this one's fur color. Deepest apologies, friends.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 benoit 12.ogg Bernard: ...Well, I suppose this means I still have a missing cat to search for! Apologies again for the confusion!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 05.ogg Elodie: Hmph...
 So... is this your friend's cat?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 06.ogg Elodie: Hmm? Oh, uh... yes, exactly.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: Wait a second — you lied earlier, didn't you?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 07.ogg Elodie: ...Lied? I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: A liar always has a tell — the look in their eyes, their breathing pattern, the way they hold themselves... The things that can give you away are often more numerous than you would think...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 08.ogg Elodie: ...What are you talking about? The way I see it, you're conflating baseless conjecture with fact.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: Normally, when someone is called out, their breathing speeds up as they begin to panic... But your breathing pattern hasn't changed one bit — in fact, it's been strangely calm and measured this entire time... It stands to reason, then, that your agitated behavior earlier was all an act.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: If you're a bad guy, I'm sure you'll take off running the first chance you get. If you're a good guy... The most likely explanation is that you're a member of the Gardes or some similar organization.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 09.ogg Elodie: And you're basing this off of...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 lynette 11.ogg Lynette: ...Intuition, nothing more.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 10.ogg Elodie: Hah... Intuition? Well, I have to hand it to you, Lynette...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 11.ogg Elodie: You're right. I'm a member of the Gardes — the name's Elodie. I'm currently investigating a cross-border smuggling case. This cat here... "Bonnie" was her name? Well, her owner is one of the prime suspects of our investigation.
 ...!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 12.ogg Elodie: A couple of days ago, our suspect got wind that we were on his tail and fled. That's most likely how he got separated from the cat.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 13.ogg Elodie: I just so happened to stumble upon your notice in The Steambird, so I decided to see if he'd come back for her... But, it looks like I overestimated him.
 If I were on the run...
 I don't think I'd come back either...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 14.ogg Elodie: The impact of this case has been huge. The Marechaussee Phantom, the Gardes, and the Special Patrol have all launched investigations. If there was even the slightest chance that he would show himself, I had to follow up on the lead.
 So, what's being smuggled?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 15.ogg Elodie: ...A new kind of illegal drug: Imitation Sinthe.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 16.ogg Elodie: We confiscated all the Sinthe on the market, but addiction isn't something that goes away overnight. Even without substances on the market, people are still looking for a way to get their next fix.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 17.ogg Elodie: And criminals... are all too eager to capitalize on that addiction. That was the impetus for Imitation Sinthe. Needless to say, a small-scale market opened up very quickly...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 18.ogg Elodie: After the original Sinthe debacle, we put several measures into place to prevent similar incidents from occurring. The perpetrators got smart, though, and shifted their sales overseas before those measures could kick in. That's when the Imitation Sinthe smuggling began.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 19.ogg Elodie: We only recently got word of the presence of Imitation Sinthe overseas. We managed to track down evidence of some early transactions. What we were able to find out, however, hasn't proven that useful given the amount of time that has passed.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 20.ogg Elodie: The Marechaussee Phantom launched an investigation to track down every person in Fontaine capable of producing a drug like that. That's how we learned about Bonnie's owner...
 Who is he exactly?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 21.ogg Elodie: He's a researcher at the Fontaine Research Institute. His name is Pierre... Pierre Lefevere, to be exact.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 lynette 12.ogg Lynette: Lefevere!
(If Passive Check succeeds)

(Insight Check Success) Lynette's expression seems a bit unnatural...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (A slight look of dread just crossed Lynette's face... Strange, she usually schools her expressions with mechanical precision...)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 22.ogg Elodie: ...The Marechaussee Phantom found him in Poisson. In addition to the cat, he also had a pendant with him.
Missing quest item picture
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 23.ogg Elodie: At first, there wasn't much cause for suspicion. A search of his house didn't reveal much to go off of either. The Marechaussee Phantom very nearly left it at that.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 24.ogg Elodie: It was only later that we realized the coat of arms on his pendant... belonged to none other than the Lefevere family, one of the most infamous aristocratic families in Fontaine.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 25.ogg Elodie: ...Obviously, this discovery prompted a further investigation into Pierre. At that point, however, we discovered that he had already fled. Now, the Gardes and the Special Patrol are all searching for him.
 Could his family be hiding him?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: That's not possible, actually. The Lefevere family... has been gone for a long time.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 26.ogg Elodie: Exactly... Many years ago, several important members of the family, including the patriarch, were murdered by an assassin of unknown origin. From that point on, the family's power and influence took quite the hit.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 27.ogg Elodie: The family has engaged in all manner of crimes. As you can imagine, there's no shortage of people waiting in the wings to take their revenge. And with the family severely weakened, they were able to do just that. Most of the remaining family members succumbed to sickness or hunger. The ones that survived are currently living out their days under a new identity.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 28.ogg Elodie: Pierre is one of those very survivors. He's been hiding away in the Fontaine Research Institute all these years, his true identity unbeknownst to all... until now, that is.
 Is it really okay to share all this information with us?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 29.ogg Elodie: ...Well, my fellow Gardes have told me all about how smart and courageous you both are, and I know you possess a strong sense of justice.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 30.ogg Elodie: There could be a chance that Pierre, or one of his accomplices, might attempt to get close to Bonnie. Now that you've been briefed on the situation, I was hoping you'd help us keep a lookout.
Bonnie: Meow...?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 31.ogg Elodie: If I take Bonnie back to the Gardes with me, there's no way Pierre will try and come for her — not even the most daring of criminals would attempt something like that.
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (So we should keep Bonnie with us for the time being?)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 32.ogg Elodie: I have to admit — I'm not holding out too much hope that Pierre will come back for her... But if there's even the slightest chance, then it's worth a shot.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918504 elodie 33.ogg Elodie: Well, I've got some other leads to follow up on. If Pierre does appear, please contact me right away.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: ...
 What's wrong?
 You don't look so good...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: ...It's nothing. I'm fine.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: It's just... The head of the Lefevere family — he was the "eminent person" who kidnapped me all those years ago.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: ...It was at a dinner party. Someone tricked me into boarding the Lefevere family carriage. Whoever it was, they took me back to their home.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: ...But, before anything worse could happen, "Father" intervened.
 So that's what happened...
 Then the assassin Elodie mentioned...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: Yep. Father was the one who orchestrated the fall of the Lefevere family. That's what led Lyney and I to join the House of the Hearth.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: After all these years... I never thought I'd hear the Lefevere name again.
 ...Are you okay?
Bonnie: ...Meow?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: Don't worry about me. I wasn't feeling sorry for myself... I was just thinking about Lyney.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: He's been acting strange recently... He avoids me for days on end, consumes himself with some secret investigation, and then out of the blue pushes me to do that acting job...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: Thinking about it now... It's almost like the "1" I drew from that deck of cards was part of his plan all along. He must have asked Freminet to help him out. In any case, I know he's hiding something from me. He's really pulled out all the stops this time.
 You think he knows about Pierre?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 11.ogg Lynette: It's very possible. I'm sure he tried to send me away because he was afraid it would bring up some painful memories for me... It wasn't necessary, though.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 12.ogg Lynette: ...Even after all these years, he's still as overprotective as ever.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: You'll have to help me teach him a lesson if we run into him along the way.
 Along the way? Are we going somewhere?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 14.ogg Lynette: Yep. I want to head to the Fontaine Research Institute to learn more information about Pierre. Just let me activate search mode, and then we'll head out... Who knows — maybe we'll run into Lyney along the way.
 Are you trying to help out Lyney with his investigation?
 Or are you trying to prove yourself?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 15.ogg Lynette: A little bit of both, perhaps. For the most part, though, I just have this sense that something's not right. Something isn't adding up about Pierre's story... I'm just not sure what...
 I also want to know what secrets he's hiding...
 Sometimes, you've just got to take the bull by the horns, right?
Bonnie: Meow!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918505 lynette 16.ogg Lynette: Okay, I'll write a letter explaining everything to the crew. Once that's done, we can head out.

Lefevere's Curse[]
 Step DescriptionBonnie's "master" seems to be a problematic character. You decide to investigate...

(Approach Lyney and Chevreuse)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 01.ogg Lyney: Lynette...! Y—You're, uh, not at rehearsal?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: ...You can drop the act, Brother. In fact, I don't think either of us will have a need for acting any time soon. You should know better than to try and keep something from me — you've never been able do to that, even when we were kids.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 02.ogg Lyney: *sigh*... And that's why I tried to distract you with the masked mime show... But I guess you're just too good.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: Care to introduce us to your "new assistant"?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 03.ogg Lyney: Ahem... This is Officer Chevreuse, captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. You may have met her already...
(If the player has met Chevreuse)

 We meet again.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 01.ogg Chevreuse: Nice to see you.
(If the player has not met Chevreuse)‍[verification needed]

 Hello.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 02.ogg Chevreuse: It's an honor to meet you. I have to admit — I'm quite familiar with you both already.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 03.ogg Chevreuse: ...I should clarify something — Mr. Lyney's here at my invitation, not the other way around. To borrow your expression, Miss Lynette, I suppose that would make him "my" assistant more than anything.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 04.ogg Chevreuse: We've brought on Mr. Lyney as a consultant in the past. He was instrumental in helping us crack a case involving a perpetrator who used magic tricks to commit crimes. I was hoping he'd be able to provide some valuable insight this time around as well.
 Are you here because of the Lefevere case?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 05.ogg Lyney: Ah, so you've... heard everything then?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 05.ogg Chevreuse: That's exactly why we're here. There's always been questions surrounding the fall of the Lefevere family. Some people even believe the House of the Hearth was involved.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 06.ogg Chevreuse: Whoever was behind it all was extremely cautious. They didn't leave a shred of evidence... This very fact, however, leads me to believe it was indeed the work of that Harbinger.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 07.ogg Chevreuse: I took a look at the entrance and exit records of all the carriages that night. Let's just say, it wasn't hard to deduce that there's ill-will between you two.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 08.ogg Chevreuse: Don't worry. I don't have any evidence to that effect, and I certainly don't plan on going to bat for such a despicable family. Plus, you were victims back then more than anything.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 09.ogg Chevreuse: I sought Mr. Lyney's help with the smuggling case, nothing more.
 ...You're really teaming up with the House of the Hearth?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 10.ogg Chevreuse: The way I look at it — it's a collaboration between us as people, not the organizations we represent. Besides, by working together, we can expose the truth as quickly as possible — you can hardly say that's at odds with the justice my organization strives for.
 I'm assuming you wouldn't be opposed to some extra help?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 11.ogg Chevreuse: Not at all. I was planning to invite you from the very beginning, Miss Lynette... It's just that my "assistant" here raised some objections.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 06.ogg Lyney: ...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: ...Lyney, I'm not the same person I was back then.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: That little girl who did nothing but cower in the corner in fear — she doesn't need saving anymore.
 I know you want to protect your little sister...
 But little sisters don't stay little forever.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 07.ogg Lyney: ...*sigh*
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 08.ogg Lyney: I'm sorry, Lynette. You're right. I let my concerns get the better of me.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: Oh, and the next time you want to distract me... you should try a different approach.
Bonnie: Meow!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 09.ogg Lyney: Who's this? You pick up a stray while I was gone?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: Uh... It's a bit complicated. I'll explain later. Anyway, her name's Bonnie.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 12.ogg Chevreuse: Well, if there are no objections, then I suppose the only thing left to say is... Lynette, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) — welcome to the team.
Chevreuse and Lyney share with you what they've learned over the past few days...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 10.ogg Lyney: ...It appears the Lefevere family was very particular in their use of insignias and emblems.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 11.ogg Lyney: The family would use different emblems to mark differences in status, blood relation, and the like. In fact, the insignia that was discovered on the pendant was used to represent an illegitimate child.
 So that would mean... Pierre is a bastard child?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 13.ogg Chevreuse: It's highly likely. That very status might have been what allowed him to emerge from the fall of his family relatively unscathed. It would also explain why he was able to assume a new identity as a researcher with relative ease.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 12.ogg Lyney: We discovered something interesting, though. After talking to some of his coworkers, it appears he pretty much works at the Institute in name only. He's practically been cast out.
 Wait, what happened?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 14.ogg Chevreuse: Apparently, Pierre was once addicted to Sinthe. He tried to use the resources at the Institute to create a substance with a similar effect.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 15.ogg Chevreuse: He claimed it was just for research purposes, but the Institute revoked his access to the relevant materials regardless. He was placed on disciplinary leave pending a thorough investigation of his actions.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 16.ogg Chevreuse: But, it seems the Institute ran into some trouble along the way. Could have been a lack of personnel or a timing issue. In any case, they had to table their formal investigation into Pierre. Unfortunately, that also included reporting any relevant information to the higher authorities.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 17.ogg Chevreuse: As for his family background, it appears none of his coworkers at the Institute were aware of that information. All they could tell us was that he was quite the recluse.
 Hmm, maybe we'll have to take our investigation elsewhere then...
 Did you find anything useful at his residence?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 18.ogg Chevreuse: Other than the pendant, we didn't find anything else of note at his residence in Poisson.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 19.ogg Chevreuse: Based on the samples of Imitation Sinthe we've been able to analyze, it appears the substance leaves behind strong traces wherever it's produced or stored.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 20.ogg Chevreuse: Those traces might not be obvious to the casual observer, but they're not something our Guard Poodles would miss. Pierre's home, though... came up completely clean.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 21.ogg Chevreuse: We didn't find any records indicating possible involvement in overseas transactions, either. So, the Marechaussee Phantom didn't view him as a major suspect at first.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: Hmm... Maybe he had a separate, dedicated area where he made the Imitation Sinthe?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 13.ogg Lyney: Well, his neighbors did say he was often gone for long stretches of time. You would think, with him out and about so much, people would have spotted him around Poisson, but residents said they barely ever saw him in town.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 14.ogg Lyney: If his reclusive nature was just a matter of keeping a low profile, I guess it would make sense for him to have a secret base to carry out his business.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 22.ogg Chevreuse: ...After he disappeared, the Gardes conducted a thorough search of Poisson, but they didn't come across any suspicious locations.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: Poisson...
 ...What is it, Lynette?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: ...You know Hotel Debord, where I first found Bonnie? To get there from Poisson, you have to cross a stretch of ocean... It's not somewhere a cat could just wander off on its own.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 23.ogg Chevreuse: A cat? You mean...
Bonnie: Meow!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: Bonnie is Pierre's cat.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 24.ogg Chevreuse: Oh, that's right! When the Marechaussee Phantom first tracked him down, I remember there being something about a cat in their report... So this is her?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 15.ogg Lyney: From what we've learned about Pierre's habits, he doesn't seem like the type to venture out without a purpose... So what you're saying, Lynette, is that Bonnie couldn't have gone missing in Poisson. If that's true, then...
 She must have wandered off only after Pierre brought her to his secret base.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 11.ogg Lynette: Exactly. Bonnie might even know where it is.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 25.ogg Chevreuse: Wait... you think the cat can lead us there? But, she's not trained like one of our Guard Poodles. How is she supposed to understand what we want her to do?
 Lynette could give it a try.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 14.ogg Lynette: Meow... Meow meow. Meow...?
 [Animal Handling] I can give it a go... Meow... Meow meow...
(If the card drawn is less than 12)

Startled, Bonnie rushes to hide behind Lynette... She stays there for quite some time before reluctantly emerging from her hiding place...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 12.ogg Lynette: ...Ah, guess she's a little skittish around strangers.
 I'll leave it to you, then...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: Meow... Meow meow. Meow...?
(If the card drawn is greater than or equal to 12)

(Dialogue continues)
Bonnie: Meow!
Bonnie seems to understand what you want her to do... She flicks her tail and meows loudly in the direction of the cliffs and the coast.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 15.ogg Lynette: Hmm, near the coast... the beach... and beneath the cliffs... The place we're looking for is most likely north of the Court of Fontaine...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 chevreuse 26.ogg Chevreuse: ...Well, I've certainly never taken a witness statement like this before.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 16.ogg Lyney: Haha... Well, if it works out, maybe it's something worth getting used to.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 16.ogg Lynette: Cats and humans are actually pretty alike — when it comes to communication, most of what we want to convey can be accomplished through body language alone. But humans tend to rely too much on speech to ever take advantage of that fact...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lynette 17.ogg Lynette: ...Of course, body language has its limitations. You're not gonna be able to get across anything too complicated...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918506 lyney 17.ogg Lyney: The important thing is that we now have a lead. Let's try and find the place that matches the clues Bonnie gave us.
(Approach the marked location)
Bonnie: Meow!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918507 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: Seems like Bonnie is trying to take us somewhere...
(After following Bonnie)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918502 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: Gardemeks ahead!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918502 lyney 01.ogg Lyney: Look out!

Pierre's Lost Base[]

(Approach the base)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918509 chevreuse 01.ogg Chevreuse: Wow, Lynette. You found this place so easily. If I thought there was any chance you'd say yes, I'd recruit you into the Special Patrol here and now — no questions asked.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918509 lyney 01.ogg Lyney: Haha, sounds familiar. I pretty much receive letters daily from people trying to poach her from me.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918509 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: ...Let's just focus on our search. There's a lot to investigate.
(Investigate the bottles near Chevreuse)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918511 chevreuse 01.ogg Chevreuse: Aha, just as we thought — this is where the Imitation Sinthe was being made...
 These bottles and jars... They're all Imitation Sinthe?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918511 chevreuse 02.ogg Chevreuse: ...Looks like he's got more than just Imitation Sinthe stashed around here... In addition to the raw materials needed to synthesize the substance itself, there's a large quantity of cleaning agents and a few drugs I haven't been able to identify.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918511 chevreuse 03.ogg Chevreuse: These cleaning agents are likely used to dispel traces of the substance... like its smell.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918511 chevreuse 04.ogg Chevreuse: The Special Patrol did some digging into Imitation Sinthe. Our records indicate that it's very difficult for ordinary people to detect traces left behind by this stuff. I'm sure that was the case for Pierre as well.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918511 chevreuse 05.ogg Chevreuse: It must have taken a considerable amount of time and skill to ensure all those traces get washed away.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918511 chevreuse 06.ogg Chevreuse: But what are these other drugs for...
(Talk to Chevreuse again, optional)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918511 chevreuse 07.ogg Chevreuse: But what are these other drugs for...
(Investigate the bags near Lyney)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918512 lyney 01.ogg Lyney: The material these bags are made of... It's quite rare...
 Doesn't it look similar to the material used for your Magic Pockets?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918512 lyney 02.ogg Lyney: ...It's the very same, actually — Romaritime Flower fiber. But, there's something special about the composition of these bags. I took a closer look, and it appears they're not only waterproof but also corrosion and leak-resistant.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918512 lyney 03.ogg Lyney: Even the strings look specially designed to keep the bags closed nice and tight.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918512 lyney 04.ogg Lyney: I came across some bags made of the same material just now, but they were much smaller and thinner. From the look of them, they seemed far less durable as well.
 So... kind of like one of those small, sealed bags?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918512 lyney 05.ogg Lyney: ...Very similar, actually. Normally, it would be easy for a Guard Poodle to sniff out the Imitation Sinthe, but if it was sealed away in a bag like that, it might be possible to elude detection for some time.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918512 lyney 06.ogg Lyney: But what could these big bags be for then... If the goal is to keep the Imitation Sinthe hidden and sealed away, these bags seem a bit too conspicuous...
(Talk to Lyney again, optional)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918512 lyney 07.ogg Lyney: But what could these big bags be for then... If the goal is to keep the Imitation Sinthe hidden and sealed away, these bags seem a bit too conspicuous...
(Investigate the barrels near Lynette)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918510 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: ...When the Marechaussee Phantom searched Pierre's house, there was no sign of these barrels, right?
 He must've moved them. But carrying them all the way out here would attract way too much attention.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918510 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: You're right. That doesn't seem like his way of doing things... How did he get them here then?
 (Examine the barrels...)
Examine Barrels: (The barrels show signs of water damage. Dried-up water stains can be seen around the circumference of the barrels...)
Examine Barrels: (There seems to be a pattern to the location of the water stains. For some reason, they appear to be limited to the lower half of the barrels.)
Examine Barrels: (The lids don't seem very tight, leaving sizeable gaps around the edges. But, there doesn't appear to be any traces of water inside the barrels.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918510 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: Only the lower halves of the barrels appear to have been submerged in water...
(Talk to Lynette again, optional)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918510 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: Only the lower halves of the barrels appear to have been submerged in water...
(After the player has investigated all three)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 chevreuse 01.ogg Chevreuse: ...Based on the various ingredients we've found, this appears to be where Pierre was cooking up his Imitation Sinthe.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 chevreuse 02.ogg Chevreuse: It looks like he used a special cleaning agent to get rid of any residual traces of the substance on his person before he left. That's how he was able to get past the Guard Poodles.
 That's why the Marechaussee Phantom didn't find anything suspicious in his home...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 lyney 01.ogg Lyney: ...So then he transferred the Imitation Sinthe into small, sealed bags and took it somewhere else for the dropoff?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 chevreuse 03.ogg Chevreuse: No. I don't believe our suspect is the kind of person who'd go around carrying incriminating evidence with him. That would potentially create too many eyewitnesses.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 chevreuse 04.ogg Chevreuse: The cleaning agent and the sealed bags might get past the Guard Poodles, but if a member of the public or even a Garde on patrol happened to see him during the dropoff, a quick search would reveal everything. That's still a very risky operation.
 What about if the dropoff happened at sea? There'd be no one around to see him.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: ...The barrels we found were wet around the base, but the top half was dry... As if they'd been standing upright in the water.
Missing quest item picture
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: Hmm... If you put a barrel in the water, it will normally float on its side. Unless it's heavily loaded, in which case it'll sink.
 So he must have used something...
 ...Turning them into airtight flotation devices.
 ...To tightly seal big bags full of air...
 ...Turning them into airtight flotation devices.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 lyney 02.ogg Lyney: Yes... With flotation rings around the body of the barrels, they'd stay upright in the water. And then, he could afford to load them more fully.
Missing quest item picture
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 chevreuse 05.ogg Chevreuse: You think he used floating barrels? Hmm, I suppose if he acted at night, when there are very few other boats around, and visibility is low... It's a valid theory. We can't rule it out.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 lyney 03.ogg Lyney: But then, wouldn't the barrels be carried off by the waves, or the currents? How would the person doing the pickup know where to look?
 Barrels that could float away and get lost at sea...
 Sounds difficult to keep in one place. Kind of like certain pets...
Bonnie: Meow...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: ...(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), can you come take a dip in the sea with me? I have a feeling that somewhere down there... we might find some rope. If a rope can be used to keep a pet from running away... then why not a barrel?

(Talk to Chevreuse, optional)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 chevreuse 06.ogg Chevreuse: I can't believe how much progress we're making with this investigation... Without your help, getting this far would have taken me an awful lot of time and manpower.
(Talk to Lyney, optional)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 lyney 04.ogg Lyney: It's rare to see Lynette in serious mode... I wonder how long she'll keep it activated for.
(Investigate the boat)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: (The wreckage of a small boat...?)
(Investigate near the rocks)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: (This isn't the place...)
(If a certain amount of time passes)

(Perception Check Success) There seems to be something odd over there...
(Investigate the rock with rope tied around it)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918513 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: (Got it. Time to go up and report.)
(Approach the base)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: ...As expected, we found a few pieces of rope and some anchoring stones underwater. If you attach them to a floating barrel... It would look like this.
Missing quest item picture
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: With this anchoring system, it would be possible to use floating barrels for the drop-off. You would just need to drop them in the water at the agreed-upon location.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: We also came across the wreckage of a small boat... It must have been left out on the water and capsized due to the force of the wind and waves. Its small size, however, would have made it perfect for staying undetected.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 chevreuse 01.ogg Chevreuse: Let's talk this through — based on the evidence we've collected, it seems like Pierre would row a small boat out to the agreed-upon transfer point, drop off the barrels, leave, and then row back and retrieve them after the transfer was complete...
 Why use such a convoluted drop-off method, though?
 Wouldn't it be easier for both parties to meet up at the transfer point on their respective vessels and exchange the goods right then and there?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 lyney 01.ogg Lyney: It could be that he was trying to avoid meeting up with his associate face-to-face. As one of the sole survivors of the Lefevere family, maybe he was just used to that sort of elusive lifestyle.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: ...It seems like Pierre deliberately chose the floating barrel method so that the goods could be dropped off and picked up at separate times. That way, the two parties wouldn't have to meet each other.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 lyney 02.ogg Lyney: Well, if that's the case... They must not have a very close working relationship.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 chevreuse 02.ogg Chevreuse: Let's not jump to any conclusions just yet. Assumptions can be detrimental to solving a case. It's possible they were just trying to keep a low profile — two boats sailing to the same location at once could be too conspicuous.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 chevreuse 03.ogg Chevreuse: The most important thing is that we can now confirm Pierre wasn't acting alone. The floating barrel drop-off system is proof enough of that.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 chevreuse 04.ogg Chevreuse: Let's say for now that he was only in charge of producing the Imitation Sinthe. That would mean there has to be at least one other person involved in the operation — likely in charge of transporting the goods across the border.
 That explains why we couldn't find evidence linking him to any overseas operations.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 lyney 03.ogg Lyney: Since we've determined that the goods were transported by boat, maybe we can track down some travel logs or something?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 chevreuse 05.ogg Chevreuse: We can certainly check the various ports for that information. It's possible, however, that Pierre's associate also used a small boat for the transport and docked along the shore rather than at a large port. If that's the case... It's unlikely there would be any record left behind.
 Have you looked into the ports already?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 chevreuse 06.ogg Chevreuse: Absolutely. Before Pierre disappeared, we made sure to investigate all sorts of outward-bound vessels. We also had port authorities keep a lookout for anything suspicious.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 chevreuse 07.ogg Chevreuse: ...Unfortunately, we were never able to find out how they managed to get the Imitation Sinthe across the border.
 A small boat and a few barrels isn't going to get you very far...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 chevreuse 08.ogg Chevreuse: You're right. Whatever vessel was used for the pick-up, the person responsible for smuggling the substance out of Fontaine would have had to use a larger vessel for the actual transport. That's the only way they would be able to smuggle on a large enough scale to make a profit.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 chevreuse 09.ogg Chevreuse: They must have found a way to disguise the Imitation Sinthe to clear port inspections.
 Well even if we can't find any travel logs...
 We can still search for other clues.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 chevreuse 10.ogg Chevreuse: Exactly. We can't let any opportunity slip through the cracks. Although... given the amount of ports that could be involved, we should probably split up.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 lyney 04.ogg Lyney: I'll run home and ask some of my brothers and sisters to try and dig up some information.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 chevreuse 11.ogg Chevreuse: I should also head back and update my platoon on our progress. I'll grab some reinforcements while I'm at it. Lynette, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), why don't you head to Lumidouce Harbor and see what you can find out?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918515 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: Alright. Come on, Bonnie. You too.
Bonnie: Meow!

Harbored Secrets[]

(Approach Elodie and Chourei)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 elodie 01.ogg Elodie: Oh, Lynette, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)... and Bonnie, too! What brings you all here?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 chourei 01.ogg Chourei: Hmm... Did something happen?
 We're here to check the travel logs...
You update them on the situation...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 elodie 02.ogg Elodie: Ah, I see! Thank you for everything you're doing for the people of Fontaine.
 What are you doing here?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 elodie 03.ogg Elodie: I'm in charge of guarding the port. You mentioned you were after some travel logs, right? I can go fetch those for you.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 chourei 02.ogg Chourei: Looks like I've got another hard day of work ahead of me... *sigh*...
 Are things usually pretty hectic around here?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 chourei 03.ogg Chourei: No, not usually... It's this incident that happened recently. Before that, everything was normal... All we had to do was confiscate anything suspicious and we could call it a day — pretty simple stuff.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 chourei 04.ogg Chourei: But things are much more complicated now. We somehow let suspicious cargo pass through the port undetected, not even our Guard Poodles were able to sniff it out. Even worse, we still don't know how the perpetrator was able to conceal the goods so well...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: By suspicious cargo, do you mean Imitation Sinthe?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 chourei 05.ogg Chourei: Yep. However, prohibited substances are just one example. We confiscate all sorts of contraband during the course of our inspections... Or, at least, we're supposed to...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: ...So what happens to the goods you confiscate?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 chourei 06.ogg Chourei: Oh, we keep them in a storage locker. If they turn out to be something particularly dubious, we'll turn them over to the Maison Ordalie...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 chourei 07.ogg Chourei: If the goods are only slightly suspicious but could otherwise be harmless — like raw materials that could potentially be used to create contraband — we return them to the ship they were confiscated from, instead of letting them pass through the port.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 elodie 04.ogg Elodie: ...Sorry for the wait! These are the travel logs for all the recent activity at the port.
Girard: Woof! Woof!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 chourei 08.ogg Chourei: Oh... You brought Girard with you...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 elodie 05.ogg Elodie: Ah, actually, he followed me here himself. It's like he smells something on me...
Girard: Woof! Woof!
Bonnie: Meow!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 elodie 06.ogg Elodie: Huh...? I wonder why Girard is reacting to you two so strongly...
 Could be because we just left the place where the Imitation Sinthe was made...
 Whatever Girard smelled on you probably came from us...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: Huh, we were so careful not to touch it, but we still ended up with traces on us... If it leaves a residue so easily, I just don't understand how the culprit was able to disguise the goods at all.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 chourei 09.ogg Chourei: Why don't you have a look at the travel logs first? All ships coming in and out of the port are recorded here... except for the ones the port authorities ride to and from work!
You flip through the numerous travel logs...You notice several instances where the "Humane Society" is listed... The name really seems to stand out.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: The Humane Society...
 We've encountered that organization before, right?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: Their name is all over the exit logs... The purpose for leaving is always listed as "overseas adoption."
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 chourei 10.ogg Chourei: Ah, the director of the organization explained that, actually. He said a lot of the cat and dog breeds unique to Fontaine are also very popular overseas... So his organization offers an overseas adoption program.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: Bernard, the director of the Humane Society, was the man who came looking for Bonnie earlier...
Bonnie: Meow...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (The cat that fled from Pierre looks just like the cat that the Humane Society is looking for... Could that really be a coincidence?)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (It seemed as if Bernard was also hiding something... He seemed so insistent, but only ran a cursory check before just leaving like that.)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (When he came looking for Bonnie earlier... What if he wasn't actually there to check if Bonnie was his missing cat...? Maybe he was there for some other purpose...)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: ...Have you figured it out too, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? The way the criminal "disguised" the goods.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: When Bernard asked to take a closer look at Bonnie... He was actually checking whether there was any Imitation Sinthe in her stomach.
 He was using the animals at his shelter...
 To smuggle Imitation Sinthe...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 chourei 11.ogg Chourei: W—Wait, what!?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: The sealed bags we found at the secret base... They were specially made to be corrosion-resistant...
 ...So that they wouldn't be digested.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 11.ogg Lynette: There were gaps around the lids of the barrels, and airbags were used to keep them upright in the water....
 ...So that the animals would be able to breathe.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 12.ogg Lynette: Those drugs Chevreuse found at the secret base... She most likely didn't recognize them because they're not used on human beings... It's an anesthetic used on pets. The perpetrator must have given it to the animals...
 ...So that they would keep still in the floating barrels.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: Pierre... must have made the animals swallow the sealed bags full of Imitation Sinthe at his secret base. Then, he stuffed them into floating barrels and left the rest to Bernard.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 elodie 07.ogg Elodie: The sealed bags combined with an animal's body odor would certainly be enough to mask the scent of Imitation Sinthe...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 chourei 12.ogg Chourei: During our inspections... We would have never thought to inspect the bellies of those animals for anything suspicious... Even if we tried to feel around for something, I'm sure it would be difficult to detect!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 14.ogg Lynette: Exactly. I bet Bernard even transported animals with Sinthe in their stomach alongside ones without... That way, it would be even harder to say with certainty that something was amiss.
 Do you think Bonnie could have Imitation Sinthe in her stomach?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 15.ogg Lynette: ...She's probably in the clear. Otherwise, Bernard would have never left without her. I'm guessing he didn't know whether Pierre had already "hidden" the next batch of Imitation Sinthe before he fled.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 16.ogg Lynette: Just imagine — he sees the notice we put in the Steambird, and it turns out that one of the very cats he gave to Pierre for the smuggling operation is out in the open, roaming the streets of Fontaine...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 17.ogg Lynette: If Pierre had already "hidden" the next batch of Imitation Sinthe, then Bonnie would practically be living proof of their crimes. He would have had no choice but to go after her.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 elodie 08.ogg Elodie: So that's why he came to find you and insisted on taking a closer look at the cat...
 Pierre must have fled in a hurry...
 That fact is probably what spared Bonnie.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 chourei 13.ogg Chourei: Uh... Wait a second. I'm a little lost here... I get the part about hiding the substance in the pets, but those... What did you call them again? Floating barrels? Why even put the animals in there in the first place?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 chourei 14.ogg Chourei: If you've got something as convenient as a floating barrel, why not just stuff it with the Imitation Sinthe directly? Why not wait to "hide" the stuff until after the exchange has been made?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 18.ogg Lynette: In order to make sure the animals could swallow the sealed bags, they made them extremely thin. Had they not done that, the animals would have likely bitten or chewed through them.
 And if any of the Imitation Sinthe leaked out...
 They also would have needed a lot of cleaning agents to get rid of the resulting smell.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 19.ogg Lynette: That step would have required a lot of energy, as well as a certain amount of technical expertise, so it was better left to the more experienced Pierre.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 lynette 20.ogg Lynette: We've already proven how easy it is to pick up trace amounts of Imitation Sinthe, so I'm sure Bernard was taking all the precautions he could to avoid the same fate.
Girard: Woof! Woof!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 elodie 09.ogg Elodie: Okay, then let's head to the Humane Society right away and bring that guy to justice! I'll bring a Gardemek to speed up the process.
(Talk to Chourei again, optional)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918516 chourei 15.ogg Chourei: Ah, sorry, but I can't go with you... Surely, you'll be able to handle him, what between Elodie's Gardemek and all three of you?

(Approach the marked location)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918517 elodie 01.ogg Elodie: The headquarters of the Humane Society should be somewhere around here. Bernard could show up any moment now...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918517 benoit 01.ogg Bernard: ...Ah! You're the people from earlier... Wait, you're from... the Gardes!?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918517 elodie 02.ogg Elodie: After him! We can't let him get away!
(While chasing Bernard)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 01.ogg Bernard: Huff... huff...
(After catching Bernard)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 elodie 01.ogg Elodie: Give it up, Bernard!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 02.ogg Bernard: —Oof!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 03.ogg Bernard: —Mercy, have mercy! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything I know!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: The Humane Society has done so much good over the years, and yet, you have committed such an atrocious deed in its name...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 04.ogg Bernard: L—Look, I didn't have a choice, okay!? My father cared about those blasted animals so much that he didn't bother to take care of his human wife and son at all... While those animals were showered with love, I lived worse than a dog...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 elodie 02.ogg Elodie: No one asked! Tell me, how did you first get to know Pierre?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 05.ogg Bernard: Well... After I took over the Humane Society, it gradually became harder and harder to maintain its operations... Until one day, someone suddenly passed me a letter...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 06.ogg Bernard: It said that I could stand to get a large sum of money as long as I helped them to transport some animals abroad... It was only after a few such "transports" that I finally understood what I was really transporting.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 07.ogg Bernard: But then, Pierre wrote to me, saying that we were already partners in crime and that I better keep cooperating with him if I didn't want to be reported to the Gardes...
(If Passive Check succeeds)

(Insight Check Success) Bernard's expression seems a bit unnatural...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (There was a hint of dishonesty in his trembling voice...)
 He's lying.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: ...You knew it from the very beginning, didn't you? The reason why you had to go through so many steps just to transport some "animals."
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 elodie 03.ogg Elodie: I'd suggest that you confess everything right now if you don't want to add anything else to your list of crimes.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 08.ogg Bernard: Eek! Y—Yes, officer...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 09.ogg Bernard: I would order wooden barrels and flotation devices according to his instructions, and then load the sleeping animals onto a boat. Once I sailed to the location he provided, I would dump everything together into the sea...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 10.ogg Bernard: And a few days after that, I'd come by again in my boat, and pick up the animals sleeping in the barrels. Once I had received enough of them, I'd bring them to the Harbor to be adopted abroad.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 11.ogg Bernard: That guy Pierre... He was running the entire show! He set up all the meeting times and found all the foreign adopters... Oh, and he even supplied all of the goods, too! I just did the transport, he was the one who planned out and executed everything else!
 So, where is he now?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 12.ogg Bernard: L—Look, I don't know, okay!? I've never ever met him in person! We've only ever communicated through letters...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: And when did he send his final letter to you?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 13.ogg Bernard: J—Just last night! He said that the Marechaussee Phantom is now after him, so he's planning to go into hiding for some time. He didn't mention where he's thinking about going, though... But he did tell me to look out for the Gardes...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 elodie 04.ogg Elodie: It's been a few days since Pierre's last appearance... I'd wager that he sent that letter after he found his hiding spot.
 So, where is that letter now?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 14.ogg Bernard: I—I burned them... It was on his orders. I had to burn every letter after reading them — I wasn't even allowed to share them with the rest of the Society employees.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: ...Sure sounds like you're trying to use the lack of witnesses or evidence to pin the blame on Pierre.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 15.ogg Bernard: N—No! I swear, this time, I'm only telling you the truth!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 elodie 05.ogg Elodie: Well, we can check the truth of your statements at the opera house. I hope you know what'll be coming for you if I were to find any discrepancy between the evidence and the testimony you just gave!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 benoit 16.ogg Bernard: I know! I know! I swear I was just telling the truth!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 elodie 06.ogg Elodie: Phew... My thanks to you both. Had it not been for you, I really don't know what would have happened to this case...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: Bonnie helped, too.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 elodie 07.ogg Elodie: Haha, that's true. It was all thanks to her that Bernard was finally exposed.
Bonnie: Meow!
Bonnie suddenly runs and hides behind you and Lynette.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 elodie 08.ogg Elodie: Haha, and it looks like she's grown quite fond of you two as well. Then I'll leave you be — just let me know if you find any other new leads.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918522 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: ...
(If Passive Check succeeds)

(Insight Check Success) Lynette's expression seems a bit unnatural...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (It seems that Lynette still has something on her mind...)

Falling Into Layers of Fog[]

(Talk to Lynette)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: ...
 Something on your mind still?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: Ah, it was that obvious, huh... Well, even though it didn't feel like Bernard was lying, after talking to him, I'm getting an even stronger sense that something's not quite right.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: We investigated so quickly that perhaps we've missed a thing or two along the way. Let me activate deduction mode and consider things again from the top to see if we can find anything new.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: ...Is there still anything unresolved or strange that we should try to consider?
 About what we found in Poisson...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: The Marechaussee Phantom found Bonnie and the Lefevere pendant at Pierre's residence. That was the beginning point of our investigation.

(The Traveler enters Contemplation)
Why is Pierre a suspect?
 
(Interpret - Bonnie)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): Bonnie has been with Pierre ever since the first meeting between Pierre and the Marechaussee Phantom, and that's why Elodie came looking for her... But that shouldn't be all...
 
(Interpret - The pet handoff)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): According to Bernard, the trafficked animals were taken directly to Pierre's base, rather than to Poisson.
 
(Interpret - Pendant)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): The pattern on the pendant is proof that its owner is an illegitimate child of the Lefevere family... But this shouldn't be all...
 
(Interpret - The end of "Lefevere")
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): The Lefevere family is infamous in Fontaine, and even their innocent scions became targets of revenge. But Pierre just carried the pendant with him as if it was an ordinary piece of jewelry.
 
(Associate - The end of "Lefevere" to The pet handoff)
(Interpret - Initial suspicions)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): Pierre became the key suspect in the case because of a suspicious cat and a suspicious pendant.
 
(Submit the wrong association)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): Hmm... I can't seem to piece everything together into a cohesive picture.
 
(Submit the wrong conclusion)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (No... I don't think that can be used to answer the question at hand.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: There's no need to rush. Let's see if we can find any other suspicious points about this case.
(Return to option selection)

(Submit conclusion - Initial suspicions)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: Why would he leave such an obvious trail for us to follow when he took so much care to not leave any traces of Imitation Sinthe in his home?
(Return to option selection)
 About Bernard's letters...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: Bernard claims to have received a letter last night from Pierre. In the letter, Pierre stated that he had gone into hiding. Is there something wrong with the letter...?

(The Traveler enters Contemplation)
What's suspicious about the letter Bernard received?
 
(Interpret - The letter's delivery method)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): Regardless of whether he sent it anonymously or secretly delivered it himself, it's no longer something we can follow up on.
 
(Interpret - Escape location)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): The letter didn't mention Pierre's hiding spot... Although it makes sense that Pierre wouldn't want anyone to find him.
 
(Interpret - The lost cat, Bonnie)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): Bonnie had already been on the loose for a few days when we found her yesterday morning. That means she had already broken free when the letter was written.
(Unlocks - The letter's purpose)
 
(Interpret - The letter's purpose)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): If the point of the letter was to tell Bernard to get on his guard, then why didn't it also warn him about Bonnie?
 
(Submit the wrong conclusion)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (No... I don't think that can be used to answer the question at hand.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: There's no need to rush. Let's see if we can find any other suspicious points about this case.
(Return to option selection)

(Submit conclusion - The letter's purpose)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: If Bonnie had Imitation Sinthe in her body, then she was a liability that had to be recovered at all costs. But if she wasn't carrying anything, then it would have made sense to tell Bernard not to worry.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: And thinking about it, Bernard only attracted our attention in the first place because he came to look for Bonnie.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: Could it be that the person who wrote the letter also knew nothing about Bonnie's whereabouts... or they had a separate goal entirely?
(Return to option selection)
 There's an unexplained part in the operations of this traffikcking ring...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 11.ogg Lynette: Well, we've discovered that Bernard is responsible for the trafficking, while Pierre deals with "supplying the goods." Is there something else in this scheme that we're missing?

(The Traveler enters Contemplation)
Is there anything else that is difficult to explain?
 
(Interpret - Ingredients)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): According to Chevreuse's investigations, Pierre has been formally reprimanded for his Sinthe-related research, and can no longer get any materials from the Fontaine Research Institute.
 
(Interpret - Handoff)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): We've already proven that Bernard and Pierre coordinated their handoffs by passing floating barrels to each other on open stretches of water.
 
(Interpret - Ledger)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): Bernard can be compensated for his work after completing a shipment. No suspicious record would be left as long as he receives the funds as an individual, rather than through the Humane Society.
 
(Interpret - Communication)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): They always communicated in writing, and all of those letters have been burned, so we can no longer confirm or trace anything.
 
(Interpret - Connections)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): Any past member of the Lefevere family would probably have a number of connections outside of Fontaine.
 
(Submit the wrong conclusion)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (No... I don't think that can be used to answer the question at hand.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: There's no need to rush. Let's see if we can find any other suspicious points about this case.
(Return to option selection)

(Submit conclusion - Ingredients)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 12.ogg Lynette: Yeah, according to Bernard, Pierre also supplied all of the goods... But if the Marechaussee Phantom's records are correct, Pierre should have lost all access to the materials required to create the Imitation Sinthe, and the Institute has also not reported any theft of their stocks.
(Return to option selection)
(If all conclusions were correctly deduced)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 14.ogg Lynette: The final question is: why did I sense that something wasn't right after hearing Bernard's testimony? Even more so than before...

(The Traveler enters Contemplation)
The "truth" behind this "testimony" is...
(Interpret - Bernard's statement)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): Both written letters and hand-offs using floating barrels are methods of communication that can be intercepted.
(Unlocks - The "accomplice" that was never met)
(Interpret - The "accomplice" that was never met)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): Bernard has never met Pierre in person.
(Interpret - Pierre's conflicting behavior)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): Pierre made such a complicated operations plan, yet also exposed himself so easily to the investigating Gardes...
(Unlocks - Does Pierre have multiple personalities?)
(Interpret - Does Pierre have multiple personalities?)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): It almost feels like the "plan" and the "expose" were done by two separate individuals, and Pierre was set up.
(Associate - Does Pierre have multiple personalities? to The "accomplice" that was never met)
(Interpret - There's still a third person out there)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): Even Bernard himself never knew that it wasn't Pierre that had been pulling his strings all along... It was someone else.
(Submit the wrong association)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): Hmm... I can't seem to piece everything together into a cohesive picture.
(Submit the wrong conclusion)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): That doesn't sound right... I need to carefully think things through...

(Submit conclusion - There's still a third person out there)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 15.ogg Lynette: Deductive mode deactivated. I think... we may be close to the actual answer.
(Talk to Lynette again, optional)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918519 lynette 16.ogg Lynette: Perhaps... we are now closing in on the truth.
(Talk to Elodie)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 01.ogg Elodie: Now behave, and follow me to the interrogation room!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 benoit 01.ogg Bernard: Ow — that hurt — oww!!
 [Contemplation] (They're about to leave. Is it really okay to let them go?)
 (If the card drawn is less than 20) (This dialogue option leads to Ending: Save the Kitty!.)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (We can leave Bernard's interrogation to the Gardes. Let's first rescue the animals at the Humane Society.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: Is everything... really over?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: I still feel like... the relationship between Pierre and Bernard is not as simple as it appears.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: Also, I've had this strange sense that something's off the entire time we've been on the case... and it has only gotten worse.
(-1 heart)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: Ah...
(-1 heart)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: Uhh...
(-2 hearts)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: ...No good... I've still got nothing, and I'm nearly out of energy.
 Don't force yourself.
 Just leave it to Lyney and the others.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: ...Alright, I'll stop thinking about it for now. At the very least, we've made it so that no more animals will suffer like those poor animals did. That's what I hope...
Bonnie: Meow...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: Let's go to the Humane Society, and see if there are any animals left that might still need our help.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: Before my energy for today completely runs out...
(Continues to Ending: Save the Kitty!)
 (If the card drawn is greater than or equal to 20) (This dialogue option leads to Closure.)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (No! We can't let her get away!)
 Hold it right there!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 02.ogg Elodie: Uh... is there something else you need from me, Traveler?
 ...Bernard and Pierre. They weren't really acting alone, were they?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 benoit 02.ogg Bernard: Huh...?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: ...I see. It all makes sense now.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 03.ogg Elodie: ...Hey, what are you talking about? Haha... Look, even our confessed criminal here has no idea what you're saying.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 11.ogg Lynette: Because he has been kept in the dark all along... and I assume it's the same with Pierre.
 Bernard thought he was communicating with Pierre...
 But for all this time, neither of them knew...
 That there was a third person all along.
 And Pierre thought he was taking orders from Bernard.
 But for all this time, neither of them knew...
 That there was a third person all along.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 04.ogg Elodie: —!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 12.ogg Lynette: That never quite added up for me. Why did Pierre feel compelled to return to his home with Bonnie and the pendant, and make them so easy to find for the Marechaussee Phantom?
 Any animals Pierre received from the floating barrels should have been taken directly to his base.
 And considering his precarious situation, the pendant should have been the last thing Pierre would leave lying around.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: Both of these things are in stark contrast to his usual meticulous and vigilant behavior. There's only one reasonable explanation — he was following orders, just like Bernard.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 14.ogg Lynette: He probably received the following instructions right before the Phantom came knocking on his door: "Bring the cat and the pendant, and our undercover agent will be sure to help you."
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 15.ogg Lynette: Unbeknownst to him, however, the "third person" who wrote that letter to him... had long decided to sacrifice him and Bernard to save themselves.
 They instructed the two men to communicate through letters and barrels specifically so that they'd never get to meet each other.
 Honestly, this third person probably planned to sell both of them out from the very beginning.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 benoit 03.ogg Bernard: What... You can't be serious... There was a third person involved!?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 16.ogg Lynette: ...If you focus only on Bernard's testimony, it's easy to believe that only Bernard and Pierre were working together. The case appeared extremely simple — Bernard did the trafficking, Pierre the Imitation Sinthe production, drugging, and stuffing.
 With everything accounted for, the third person would then be cleared of all suspicion.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 05.ogg Elodie: W—Wait, but that doesn't make any sense. If that's the actual truth, then as soon as Pierre is caught, he will explain his side of the story, and the third person will—
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 17.ogg Lynette: Yep, which is why... the third person made sure that Pierre would never be found again.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 18.ogg Lynette: Once they had instructed Pierre to expose himself, the third person wrote to Pierre again, suggesting that everything had been taken care of, and he should take Bonnie and safely return to his base.
 They then ambushed Pierre...
 And made him "disappear."
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 19.ogg Lynette: Of course, Pierre's disappearance at such a sensitive time immediately made him a prime suspect. Knowing that Bonnie had last been seen with him...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 20.ogg Lynette: All the third person would have to do from that point on would be to lead the Phantom to investigate the Humane Society, and get Bernard to confess the "truth."
 Bernard would then testify that Pierre was the one who came up with the whole plot.
 And Pierre would be seen as having gone into hiding in anticipation of getting caught.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 benoit 04.ogg Bernard: Wait... So you're saying... That the letter I received yesterday, the one that made me think Pierre was still alive... It was also sent by the third person?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 06.ogg Elodie: Is... Is that what happened!? I'll get back to headquarters right away, and re-investigate this case from the top!
 Not so fast.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 21.ogg Lynette: Chevreuse said that "assumptions can be detrimental to solving a case." Someone among us, however, has been feeding us all kinds of preconceived notions ever since our first meeting.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 22.ogg Lynette: They suggested that Pierre's disappearance was an attempt to escape the judgement of the law, and that Pierre was a scion of the Levevere [sic] family...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 23.ogg Lynette: But if the "disappearance" is truly just a coverup for a murder, then couldn't the true scion have been an illegitimate daughter, rather than an illegitimate son?
 Miss Elodie Lefevere?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 benoit 05.ogg Bernard: ...Huh?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 07.ogg Elodie: Ha.. Haha... Hahahaha!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 08.ogg Elodie: Haven't you taken this joke a bit too far? You're right, I did let a lot of assumptions get to my head when I first started to talk to you about the case. I'll make sure to correct my behavior...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 24.ogg Lynette: You deliberately fed us lies, but even you could not control every last detail of your plan. There was a flaw in your scheme... and something didn't quite go as planned.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 25.ogg Lynette: Getting the Marechaussee Phantom to notice Pierre was only the first part of your plan. Had they failed to take notice of the Humane Society, they could have cast a wider net...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 26.ogg Lynette: And you couldn't predict what they might possibly find, if given enough time. This, of course, was the main weakness of your plan.
 And once the Special Patrol and Lyney got involved...
 It became even harder to control the outcome of the investigation.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 27.ogg Lynette: As someone accustomed to acting from behind the scenes, you didn't want to take the risk of personally proposing a raid on the Humane Society. So, you thought about pulling a few more strings, so all the suspicion would point towards Bernard and his Society...
 A great option, of course, would be to also dispose of Bonnie, and leave her body at Pierre's base in anticipation of a later discovery.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 28.ogg Lynette: Once the Phantom expanded their search, it would only be a matter of time before they found Pierre's base. If a cat last seen with the suspect turned up dead at the Imitation Sinthe base...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 29.ogg Lynette: It wouldn't be long until the Phantom would figure out exactly how she had been mistreated, and turn their eyes towards the one organization that has been sending boatloads of animals out of Fontaine.
 However, something unexpected happened at the base...
 Bonnie managed to escape in the chaos.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 30.ogg Lynette: It was probably during your ambush of Pierre... You didn't even have the time to check if she had already been stuffed full of Imitation Sinthe.
Bonnie: Meow!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 09.ogg Elodie: ...!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 31.ogg Lynette: Still, you soon found another opportunity. Before long, Bonnie had made her way back into the city, and even popped up on the Steambird...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 32.ogg Lynette: Like Bernard, you desperately wanted to confirm the contents of her stomach, so you hurried to find us. Unlike Bernard, however, you were hoping that Pierre did have the time to make her swallow a load of Imitation Sinthe.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 33.ogg Lynette: While investigating the suspect's cat, we unexpectedly discovered that the suspect has been smuggling Imitation Sinthe using living animals as intermediaries. That was your plan, in any case. With that, you'd have been able to lead the investigation towards the Humane Society.
 But Bonnie was very lucky.
 But you were extremely unlucky.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 34.ogg Lynette: ...Bonnie had managed to escape before Pierre was able to stuff her full of Imitation Sinthe. That part of your plan could no longer be carried out. But as shrewd as you were, you came up with another plan right away...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 35.ogg Lynette: You manipulated the Traveler and I to help you identify Bernard as a key suspect.
 You knew Lyney was investigating the case with Chevreuse...
 And you also knew of Lynette's previous encounter with the Lefevere family.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 36.ogg Lynette: You used the Lefevere name as bait to get us to join your investigation. With two extra bodies around, the Special Patrol is sure to soon take note of the strange event of Bernard somehow having a reason to look for Pierre's cat.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 10.ogg Elodie: ...Ha, so what you're saying is... I went to all that trouble, just for the chance that you might put forth a suggestion that would lead you down the wrong path?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 37.ogg Lynette: Of course, you did far more than that. Just now, at Lumidouce Harbor... Were you not the person who highlighted the suspicious activities of the Society?
 By showing us the port's travel logs...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 11.ogg Elodie: ...Oh!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 38.ogg Lynette: You even highlighted the Society's activities during your compilation of the logs, so they'd be immediately visible to anyone examining the records.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 39.ogg Lynette: Moreover, the logs contained no records of the port authorities' activities. In other words, your activities.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 12.ogg Elodie: ...And what are you trying to suggest with that?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 40.ogg Lynette: I am insinuating that you had plenty of opportunities to transfer the raw materials for Imitation Sinthe from the harbor to a boat, and then sail over to the meeting place full of floating barrels.
 Once Bernard had placed the animals in the barrels...
 As long as you did it before Pierre came for his pickup, there'd be no one the wiser.
 You'd open the lids and also dump in the raw materials.
 As long as you did it before Pierre came for his pickup, there'd be no one the wiser.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 41.ogg Lynette: And that's how neither the trafficker nor the manufacturer knew there was a third person who supplied the raw materials, and surreptitiously operated between them.
 First, you got in touch with both parties, and secured the raw materials.
 After that, you slipped the raw materials into the barrels next to the animals...
 And requested that Pierre pick up the barrels and bring them back to his base.
 Then, you instructed Bernard to prepare the floating barrels and the animals.
 After that, you slipped the raw materials into the barrels next to the animals...
 And requested that Pierre pick up the barrels and bring them back to his base.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 42.ogg Lynette: Pierre manufactured Imitation Sinthe using the raw materials you provided, stuffed the animals, and placed the animals back into the barrels.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 43.ogg Lynette: Having received the green light from you as "Pierre," Bernard then retrieved his animals, and shipped them out of Fontaine once he had received enough for a full batch. This is the truth behind your smuggling ring.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 benoit 06.ogg Bernard: I can't believe it... I never put two and two together...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 13.ogg Elodie: Hahaha... You've sure got an extremely lively imagination.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 44.ogg Lynette: So, what do you think she's going to say next?
 Ever thought about a career in writing crime novels?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 14.ogg Elodie: Ever thought about a career in writing crime novels, huh?
 But do you have any evidence?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 15.ogg Elodie: But do you have any evidence, hm?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 45.ogg Lynette: Mhm, it appears that it's quite easy to predict what you'll think or say. Then, if we apply that to this case, we can also think of a few places to look for incriminating evidence.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 46.ogg Lynette: You know very well that this case will not end until Pierre is found, so you will have him "commit suicide" out of fear and shame to end the investigation for good.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 47.ogg Lynette: That way, you can also pin the blame for the overseas smuggling activities, the theft of the harbor's confiscated raw materials, and even the Lefevere name on him. After all, dead men tell no tales.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 48.ogg Lynette: But you still want it to appear as if he had sent that last letter to Bernard, so you have to make sure he cannot be found until after Bernard has confessed to the authorities.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 49.ogg Lynette: To do that, you either will hide his body until you've found an appropriate time to set up a fake suicide scene, or you'll dump it someplace where it'll be hard to determine the exact time of death. Submerged in water, for instance...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 50.ogg Lynette: The location would ideally allow you to keep the body hidden for some time while also letting you keep an eye on it.
 An example of such a place may be... somewhere in your own boat.
 Or underneath the waters near Lumidouce Harbor.
 You could also keep him in a very cool environment to be handled later.
 Or set fire to make it look like he had burned himself to a crisp.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 51.ogg Lynette: There are only so many options to hide a person's time of death, after all. As long as the Phantom investigates each of the possibilities in turn, they'll surely find Pierre's remains.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 52.ogg Lynette: Especially since... as the prime suspect who will now be taken into custody, you will no longer have the time to move him, or set up a fake suicide scene to cover up the murder.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 16.ogg Elodie: How absurd... And on what grounds will you order my arrest? Don't think for a second that your spouts of nonsense will amount to any kind of real argument. After all, I'm—
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 chevreuse 01.ogg Chevreuse: Elodie Lefevere!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 chevreuse 02.ogg Chevreuse: As the captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, I hereby declare you as a suspect in the case. If you have any objections, you may raise them later during interrogation.
 Chevreuse! Lyney!
 You're here, too!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lyney 01.ogg Lyney: That's right, we received a message from Lumidouce Harbor that you were going to investigate the Humane Society. We didn't expect to run into you at such a critical moment.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 chevreuse 03.ogg Chevreuse: While at the Harbor, we noticed something else extremely interesting... Apparently, you often used all kinds of excuses to swap your shifts.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 chevreuse 04.ogg Chevreuse: And if one were to match the times of your shifts to the activities of the Humane Society and those of certain foreign ships, they'd find them to be an exact match.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 17.ogg Elodie: Th—That's just a coincidence!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 53.ogg Lynette: Yes, I'm sure you have already thought of a dozen different ways to explain away the suspicious activities, but as far as evidence goes... that should be enough to warrant taking you into custody.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lyney 02.ogg Lyney: Don't worry. If it turns out that the Gardes are still unable to find any evidence after all of this, Lynette and I will do everything in our power to clear your name.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 18.ogg Elodie: Huff... huff...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 55.ogg Lynette: ...Although judging by her reaction, I assume no follow-up from us will be needed.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 elodie 19.ogg Elodie: Tch...!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 chevreuse 05.ogg Chevreuse: The Lefeveres were infamous for using disguise and infiltration to achieve their goals... Who would have thought that they would have planted someone within the Gardes.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 lynette 54.ogg Lynette: Judging from the timeline, they likely arranged for you to enter the Gardes before the fall of the clan... But they probably didn't expect you to turn it to your advantage, and use your job to save yourself during the purge.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 chevreuse 06.ogg Chevreuse: Not only that, but you actively participated in the interrogation, arrest, and judgement of the Lefeveres during their fall, thus clearing yourself of suspicion.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 chevreuse 07.ogg Chevreuse: You brutally and cruelly abandoned your allies as soon as they outlived their usefulness, just like a lizard cutting off its own tail in order to live... You've been doing this for years!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918520 benoit 07.ogg Bernard: So... So you played me like a fool after all! Ugh...!
Bernard is suddenly knocked out by a sudden strike...

Media:vo bblcop001 1900501 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: No, no, no, we don't need a reward! Rescuing those in need is only natural...

Media:vo bblcop001 1900501 caishan 09.ogg Caishan: Yes, adventurers are savvy when it comes to rewards... What'll it be? Liyue's famous Chilibrew, sweet Flowers, or Mora?
 Well, we were looking for Sweet Flowers...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900501 caishan 15.ogg Caishan: Really? Sweet Flowers in a Chilibrew...? I guess it's all Chilibrew at the end of the day, but the Mondstadt version sure sounds... interesting.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900501 caishan 16.ogg Caishan: Sweet Flowers it is, these are an excellent batch. Thanks again for your help, I better get moving.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900501 barbara 13.ogg Barbara: These Sweet Flowers look fantastic, and now we've finally got all the ingredients we need for the Chilibrew.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900501 barbara 14.ogg Barbara: Let's get back to Mondstadt. When we're inside the city, why don't you wait for me in the garden next to the Adventurers' Guild?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900501 barbara 15.ogg Barbara: When the Chilibrew is ready, I'll bring it straight over.
(Continue to Home-Made Chilibrew)
 I'd like to try that Liyue Chilibrew...
(Continue to A Spicy Brew)
 Let's go with Mora.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900501 caishan 13.ogg Caishan: The sensible option, hahaha. A seasoned adventurer, I see.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900501 caishan 14.ogg Caishan: Here you go. Thanks again for your help, I better get moving.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900501 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: Mora? That is sensible... But I guess that's to be expected from a seasoned adventurer.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900501 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: *sigh* It's getting late... and I doubt there's enough time to go looking for Sweet Flowers...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900501 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: Let's head back to Mondstadt, as for the Chilibrew... I'll have to make some for you next time.
(Hangout event ended)

A Spicy Brew[]

(While talking to Caishan)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900501 caishan 10.ogg Caishan: This? I mean, sure! I don't know if you'll enjoy it...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900501 caishan 11.ogg Caishan: There are two of you, so you'll be needing a couple of bottles.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900501 caishan 12.ogg Caishan: Here you go, pace yourselves! Thanks again for your help, I better get moving.
(Caishan leaves)
(Talk to Barbara)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900502 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Liyue Chilibrew... I've never tried it, I wonder what the flavor's like...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900502 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Well, here goes nothing.
The Traveler and Barbara try the Liyue Chilibrew...

Media:vo bblcop001 1900502 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: *coughing*
Media:vo bblcop001 1900502 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: Wh—Whoa... spicy... throat's on fire...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900502 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: ...This isn't like the Chilibrew I make at all...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900502 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: ...Wh—What do you think?
 It's... something new...
 *coughing*
Media:vo bblcop001 1900502 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: Whew... I guess we don't have to finish them. It's getting late, and I doubt there's enough time to go looking for Sweet Flowers...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900502 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: When we get time, I'll make some for you. My version's a little easier on the tongue. Less... stimulating.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900502 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: Let's head back to Mondstadt, my break's nearly over.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900502 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: Thanks for your company today, Honorary Knight. Even though it was only half a day, I had a great time.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900502 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: Next time, you can try my special Chilibrew.

Home-Made Chilibrew[]

(Head to the garden near the Adventurers' Guild and wait for Barbara)
(Talk to Barbara)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Sorry for the delay, the Chilibrew's ready! Why don't we drink these here?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Here, this one is for you. Let me know what you think!
 This is... pretty good.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Really? Is the flavor okay for you?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: I was worried you might not like it.
 So what got you into Chilibrew?
 You've got an... interesting taste in drinks...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: Um... Now that you mention it, I guess I'm the only one in the whole of Mondstadt that likes Chilibrew.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: Well... I like Chilibrew because... actually, it's a little embarrassing...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: At first, I drank Chilibrew just to keep me awake...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: When I first began singing practice, I had to get up early every day.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: After practice, I would go work at the Church to take care of official matters.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: But because I was getting up so early... my singing wasn't getting any better. Sometimes I'd be half asleep, singing the wrong lyrics, it was a disaster...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: I went to people for advice on how to stay awake. They had all kinds of methods: running, chewing mint... one adventurer even told me they'd fight slimes to stave off sleep...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: None of these ideas worked for me, they were too time-consuming. By the time I started to feel awake, there was hardly any time left for practice.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 13.ogg Barbara: Hehe, that was until I started chewing Jueyun Chilis...
 And that didn't... affect your voice?
 Sounds bad for singing...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 14.ogg Barbara: Hehe, that's what Sara said... She told me not to chew them, but to use the Jueyun Chilis to make some kind of drink, something milder in flavor...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 15.ogg Barbara: Using Sweet Flowers to temper the flavor was also her idea.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 16.ogg Barbara: That's when I started using this new and improved Chilibrew method. After a while... I actually started to enjoy the flavor.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 17.ogg Barbara: Whenever I drank it, the spiciness would always push me to work harder...
 I guess that's what "hard work" tastes like...
 Sounds like this bottle of Chilibrew is a reflection of your determination.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 18.ogg Barbara: I don't know what to say...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 19.ogg Barbara: My determination is nothing compared to yours. I heard Amber say that you're traveling far and wide, looking for your sibling. Is that true?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 20.ogg Barbara: Oh, the things you've faced, and those yet to come... are more difficult than a few bad songs.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 21.ogg Barbara: Even if I can't assist you in other ways, when it comes to healing, you can count on me. No matter the wound, I will help you recover.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 22.ogg Barbara: Uh- have I said too much? Sorry, I'm not used to taking a break, I keep boring you to death...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 23.ogg Barbara: It's not often I get so much freedom. Let's just... take our time and drink our drinks.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 24.ogg Barbara: Tomorrow, it's back to chasing our dreams with hard work.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900504 barbara 25.ogg Barbara: I hope our dreams can come true, in the end.

Dialogue[]
 Quest DescriptionSo Sayu wanted you to learn ninjutsu so that you could replace her at work...
Twinjutsu[]

(Approach the location)
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: I'll show you my favorite skill to practice. Basically, it's an escape technique — I use it to make a quick getaway whenever the shrine maiden's after me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: *sigh* Alright, Sayu, just leave the explanation to me. This is a technique to help ninja train their agility.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 02.ogg Kano Nana: When the unpredictable happens during a mission, ninja must be capable of traversing a variety of terrains.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 03.ogg Kano Nana: During our training, we often set up obstacles on both sides of this stream and have Sayu make her way up the course.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: I often slipped when I was little and either found myself falling face-first into the mud or getting battered as I tumbled down.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: So don't underestimate this little course of ours, it's not as easy as you think.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 04.ogg Kano Nana: Sayu may be exaggerating a little. With your adventuring experience, I'm sure you'll do fine.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: Yeah, go ahead and give it a try, I'll guide you through it.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 05.ogg Kano Nana: Nice try, Sayu. You'll run the course first. Quickly, now.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: Aw...
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 06a.ogg Kano Nana: Come now, no stalling. Give the Traveler a proper demonstration.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Alright, alright. Leave it to me.
Sayu agilely comes upstream and reaches the destination.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 07.ogg Kano Nana: Although Sayu doesn't usually exert her best effort, she does have strong ninja fundamentals.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 08.ogg Kano Nana: Do your best. I'll be waiting at the finish, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).

(If time runs out)
You could not complete the training within the time limit...
(Return to the previous step)
(If you're out of the track)
You left the training area, thus failing the training.
(Return to the previous step)
(Redo the challenge)
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 08.ogg Kano Nana: Do your best. I'll be waiting at the finish, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).

(After finishing the training)

(If you finished it within 30 seconds)
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Wow, impressive. You've really got some talent.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: If I were to rate your performance, I'd say you're like... a strong, fast mujina.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Anyway, nicely done. I was *yawn* ...rooting for you.
(If you finished it within 30—60 seconds)
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: You're still a way off from my personal record, but don't worry, just keep it up.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: If I were to rate your performance, I'd say you're like... an average, everyday kitsune.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: A kitsune is pretty good, you know...
(If you finished it within 60—90 seconds)
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: Ouch, that was... a little unfortunate.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: If I were to rate your performance, I'd say you're like... a slow, arthritic turtle.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: But don't let that bother you, more practice is all you need.
 Why are you talking so different all of a sudden?
 You're still Sayu... aren't you?
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Hehe, don't mind me, I just happened to remember the words of my sensei.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: After each training session, sensei would give me a score and encourage me based on my results.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: I'm surprised you remember your sensei's words so clearly, Sayu, hehe. But don't you think your sensei would disapprove of you copying their words?
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: Hehe, no way! Sensei wouldn't be mad at all.
 Where is your sensei now? Have they already left these lands?
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: Yep, Sensei said there were some important matters to attend to.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: Sensei told me that they hoped I would become a responsible ninja while they are away. You know, the kind of ninja everyone can trust.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 kanonana 02.ogg Kano Nana: You remember your Sensei's words, but you sure don't seem to act on them, skipping work all the time...
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: Hey, I work hard... when I'm not sleepy. It's just that this season is perfect for napping, I really can't help it.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 kanonana 03.ogg Kano Nana: *sigh* The problem is that to you, every season is perfect for napping.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 kanonana 04.ogg Kano Nana: Anyway, you've certainly handled the training well so far. The next exercise is live-combat training. Let's go, shall we?
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 kanonana 05.ogg Kano Nana: Considering that you have yet to grasp the art of ninjutsu, we'll let Sayu demonstrate in combat first. And this will be a prime opportunity for you to see her ninjutsu first hand.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Sure thing, just leave it to me. Let my example illuminate your path to ninjutsu.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 kanonana 06.ogg Kano Nana: *sigh* There you go again, Sayu. You know, imitating what other people say is a poor habit.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: S—Sorry...

Live Combat Observation[]

(Approach the location)
Media:vo zycop001 1901504 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: Here we are. Now, please carefully observe Sayu's skills in combat.
Media:vo zycop001 1901504 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: I'll do my best to make my ninjutsu a little easier to understand.

(After the battle)
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Whew, I'm tired.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: At least I didn't get my outfit dirty... *yawn*
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: So, did you pay close attention to my ninjutsu?
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: Here, I'll teach you. First you stretch your upper body a bit, do a little wiggle... And then turn yourself into a ball, like this...
 Hold on.
 No need to rush.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: Huh? What's the matter? You don't want to transform into a ball?
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Don't worry, you might feel a little dizzy at first, but you'll get used to it.
 I don't think this technique is as easy as it looks...
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: I thought you'd be able to catch on after seeing a quick demonstration.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: *yawn* Anyway, I'm beat and need a good nap now. Hopefully I won't need to demonstrate that again.
 But didn't you say that you would show me the path to ninjutsu?
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: Uh yeah, that was my sensei's teaching... Very strong and patient... which is a little too much work for me.
 I'm really starting to wonder what kind of person your sensei was.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Strong, responsible, and kind. Sensei never pushed me to do more work.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: Uh...
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: Actually, after hearing myself say that, I suppose Sensei was a lot like you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: Although you don't know ninjutsu like Sensei did, your other qualities are enough to make you my sensei.
 Your sensei was also a ninja? Did they go by a special name?
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: Sure, Sensei's name was... Uh, what was it now...? Huh, I guess I never asked, I just called them "sensei."
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: I think Sensei was a ninja. Actually, Sensei never really mentioned it...
 Okay... Well, how about some other qualities like their height?
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Sensei's height... Hmm, they were taller than me. As for other qualities...
 It seems there was a lot you didn't know about your sensei.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Sometimes it's hard to tell from just appearances... But these details don't matter to me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: Alright, that's enough idle chatter for now. If Sayu's sensei ever returns, I'm sure you'll have the chance to meet.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 kanonana 02.ogg Kano Nana: As for our next exercise...
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: Uh wait, I'm not quite up to it yet... I need to take a break first.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 19.ogg Sayu: We agreed on a break after every two exercises, didn't we? Remember, to keep training from being too forceful...
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 kanonana 03.ogg Kano Nana: Fine. Even if I did push you, I suppose you would end up napping on the field anyway.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 kanonana 04.ogg Kano Nana: Go, have a rest. I shall wait for you here. Remember, no running off.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 20.ogg Sayu: Got it. Come with me, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). I'll take you to a nice place to relax a bit.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 21.ogg Sayu: Whew. Finally, time for a break!
(Talk to Kano Nana again)
Media:vo zycop001 1901505 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: You may go have a break with Sayu. It's important to recover your stamina and stay hydrated.

Break Time![]

(Approach the location)
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Just as I thought, exactly the same as before...
 What is the rope there used for?
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Sensei knew that I was concerned about my height, so before leaving, Sensei measured my height and used the rope to mark it on the tree over there.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: "Nothing is more satisfying than growing." At least, that's what Sensei told me...
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: But even after all this time, not only have I yet to outgrow the rope... I think the rope is getting higher with the tree.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: *sigh* Maybe it's because I'm not sleeping enough.
 It's normal for trees to grow taller than people.
 Trees should be taller than people.
 I don't think a tree of this height will grow any taller.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: I get it, and that's exactly what I told Sensei at the time.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: But Sensei only laughed, though they didn't scold me at all... I guess Sensei had their own way of looking at things.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: I really couldn't tell what Sensei was thinking in moments like that. Do you have any idea what Sensei might have meant?
 I think I have an idea, but it is just a guess.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: That's okay, just say it. Either way, I'm sure you understand more than me.
 All trees will grow sooner or later.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Grow...
 All trees will bloom sooner or later.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: Bloom...
 All trees will cast shade over someone they can protect sooner or later.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: Shade...
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: Hmm, I think I understand now.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: I love to take naps under a tree, or hide in the shade, or eat some of its fruit. This is how the tree provides for me.
 I believe Sensei hoped that one day you would provide for someone in the same way.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: I see...
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Okay, just wait here. Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Sayu swiftly fetches a pile of fruit and returns.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: These fruits are for you.
 I think you're taking this a little too literally.
 Seems you haven't grasped the deeper meaning at all.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: No, no. I get it now! Uh, how should I put it...
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 19.ogg Sayu: Sometimes I think that the Shuumatsuban is more trouble than it's worth. Everyone's trying to keep me from getting enough sleep and growing taller... Sometimes I wonder why I even bother sticking around with them.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 20.ogg Sayu: But every time I think about it, I can't help but remember Sensei's smile, and then I think of this tree, and my Vision.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 21.ogg Sayu: Someday, this tree will also be shelter for a kitsune, or some other animal. In the same way, someday, after I've grown nice and tall, I'll be protecting someone with my ninjutsu.
 Which is exactly why you should take your work more seriously.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 22.ogg Sayu: I know...*sigh* Sorry. I guess I was hoping that I'd grow faster, and then I could work hard. But it seems that I've already spent too much time trying to grow...
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 23.ogg Sayu: "If I gave up my dreams of growing tall, could I still fulfill everyone's hopes?" I've always avoided asking myself this question, it just makes me feel a little nervous... And I've yet to find an answer.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 24.ogg Sayu: I still don't know what to do. *sigh* I don't even know what I actually can do... But, I thought that at least I can give you some fruit to eat, hehe.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 25.ogg Sayu: You remind me of Sensei — you're kind and can even understand what Sensei was thinking.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 26.ogg Sayu: So I thought I should at least show a little bit of enthusiasm.
 You can call me "Sensei" if you like.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 27.ogg Sayu: Huh? But wasn't I the one teaching you ninjutsu just now?
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 28.ogg Sayu: Although, I'm sure you know a lot more about life than me... So I guess you could still count as my teacher in that regard.
 Why don't we just relax for now. We're supposed to be taking a break, remember?
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 29.ogg Sayu: Oh yeah, you're right. Hehe, I was getting a little carried away.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 30.ogg Sayu: Why don't we go practice a little more ninjutsu after our break is up? Today is one of those rare days when I feel super motivated!
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 31.ogg Sayu: But never mind that for now, we've got lots of fruit to eat. C'mon, take whichever you like, hehe.

Trivia[]
変わり身 Kawarimi in the Japanese name is likely a reference to the fictional ninja technique Kawarimi no Jutsu (Japanese: 変わり身の術 "changed body technique") in which a ninja disguises and substitutes their body for an inanimate object.

 Sounds like Ginna got more than she bargained for out of that backstage job...
 You gave her your supporting role in the play, too?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918401 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: Merieux said she's a very promising young actress, and she has natural chemistry with her older sister. In their capable hands, the show doesn't need me to attract an audience anymore.

 Quest DescriptionNoelle reveals to you that she is very anxious about the Knights of Favonius selection exam. At your suggestion, the two of you head to the Adventurers' Guild, hoping to get some extra exam experience.

Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 01.ogg Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild. What kind of commission would you like to take on today?
 About the adventurers' ranking exams...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 02.ogg Katheryne: You wish to take an exam? Please wait while I verify your adventure record and the status of your recent commissions...
 I wasn't asking for me...
 I meant Noelle...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Sorry, Ms. Katheryne. Actually, I am the one who wishes to take the exam...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 03.ogg Katheryne: Oh? Noelle... You are finally ready to join the Adventurers' Guild? Wonderful, I will process your application at once...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: No, no... I just want to take an exam for the experience...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Right now, I don't have any plan to become an adventurer... I'm sorry...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 04.ogg Katheryne: I see... What a pity.
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 05.ogg Katheryne: Our exams are only available to official members of the Guild. The content of each exam is determined based on the adventurer's individual experience and commission status. As such, I am unfortunately unable to arrange for you to have an exam.
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 06.ogg Katheryne: However... since you just want to experience what an exam is like, perhaps you can talk to Cyrus, the branch master?
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 07.ogg Katheryne: As it happens, he has recently been working on a new entrance exam for the Guild. It has not yet been approved for official use... Perhaps you could give it a trial run?
 Pretty sure there was no such exam when I first joined...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 08.ogg Katheryne: Indeed... Although, the entrance exam does have something to do with you joining the Guild...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 09.ogg Katheryne: You can ask Branch Master Cyrus if you require more details. He should be at Angel's Share right now drafting a syllabus. He said he gets more "inspired" when he's there...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 10.ogg Katheryne: We don't yet know what's included in the syllabus. Others in the Guild have produced several drafts, but all of them were rejected by Cyrus...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: It sounds as if I'll have a good chance of running into something unexpected.
 Let's give it a try.
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Yes, let's... I wonder what will be on the exam...

Adventurer's Entrance Exam[]
 Quest DescriptionFrom Katheryne, you and Noelle learn that the Adventurers' Guild Branch Master, Cyrus, is currently working on an entrance exam for new adventurers.

(Go to the Angel's Share and find Cyrus)
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Hunt down three Ruin Guards... Hmm, could it be a little too difficult? Ugh, what am I thinking, the newcomers will run a mile...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Hunt down three boars in the forest... Nay, the Guild will never approve that...
 What are you doing?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Oh, it's you... and Noelle, I see...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Hello, Mr. Cyrus. Are you working on the exam syllabus? How is it coming along?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Ugh, don't get me started... Since (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) solved the Stormterror crisis and became Mondstadt's hero, a whole load of young people got excited and decided to join the Adventurers' Guild...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: But most of them have no experience at all. They can't even handle a single slime without getting all battered and bruised in the process. So, some genius in the Guild decided: Why don't we make an entrance exam? *sigh*
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: That sounds... like a good idea, no? This way, the adventurers won't get hurt so easily.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: ...Yes, but if the exam is too difficult, no one will want to join!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 07.ogg Cyrus: A few scrapes and bruises is nothing a strong will can't compensate for! Why doesn't anyone else in the Guild understand this...?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 08.ogg Cyrus: Anyway, I already rejected two drafts, and now I am working on a third one myself. It's absolutely crucial that I get the difficulty level right...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 09.ogg Cyrus: *sigh* If only someone could give it a test run... At least then I could decide where the upper limit of difficulty should be...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Then... Mr. Cyrus, may I give it a try?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: I am very interested in... in experiencing the adventurer's entrance exam!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 10.ogg Cyrus: Oh? Noelle, you mean... you want to take the adventurer's entrance exam?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 11.ogg Cyrus: Haha! That's fantastic! Well, if it's you, Noelle... even with every challenge at the highest difficulty, you shouldn't have any problem at all.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Yes, please make sure they are the most difficult!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 12.ogg Cyrus: Excellent! That's the spirit of a true adventurer! Now, let me explain the rules of the exam.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 13.ogg Cyrus: First, since adventurers often work in groups, you are welcome to invite others to assist you during the exam.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 14.ogg Cyrus: If (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) is willing, please join Noelle.
 So even at the highest difficulty, you can just get someone else to help...?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 15.ogg Cyrus: Indeed. Second, there are three parts to the exam, which are basic knowledge, survival skills, and a combat exercise.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 16.ogg Cyrus: You only need to pass two out of three parts to succeed in the exam... but of course, Noelle should find she has no trouble getting a perfect score.
 So you can still pass the exam even if you're no good at combat...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 17.ogg Cyrus: Ahem... And finally, remember at all times that being an adventurer takes courage and resilience! Ad astra abyssosque!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Ad... Ad astra abyssosque...!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 18.ogg Cyrus: Haha, that's the spirit. Without further ado, let's start part one — basic knowledge.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 19.ogg Cyrus: A true adventurer must be well-versed in all sorts of relevant knowledge to handle whatever may come their way.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 20.ogg Cyrus: I will ask you three questions. You may discuss among yourselves first before giving me an answer.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 21.ogg Cyrus: Question one. An adventurer must be well acquainted with their environment to make sure they can obtain any resources they need.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 22.ogg Cyrus: Tell me, which of the following local specialties of Mondstadt cannot be found near Wolvendom? Dandelion Seeds, Calla Lilies, Windwheel Asters, or Small Lamp Grass?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Hmm, Wolvendom... I remember reading that there are Wolfhooks everywhere, but the book made no specific mention of any other plants...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Hmm... No, I must approach this question differently... Is there anything here that requires specific environmental conditions in order to grow? Conditions that Wolvendom cannot provide?
 Dandelion Seeds.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 24.ogg Cyrus: Ooh, I'm afraid... That's the wrong answer...
 Small Lamp Grass.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 24.ogg Cyrus: Ooh, I'm afraid... That's the wrong answer...
 Calla Lily.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 24.ogg Cyrus: Ooh, I'm afraid... That's the wrong answer...
 Windwheel Aster.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: That's it! The Windwheel Aster mostly grows in Stormterror's Lair, at Windrise, and near Statues of The Seven. All the others are much more widely found...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: Mr. Cyrus, our answer is Windwheel Aster!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 23.ogg Cyrus: Correct! There's no fooling you two, eh?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 25.ogg Cyrus: On to question two. An adventurer must always learn from their experience and keep track of everything they encounter in the form of a diary.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 26.ogg Cyrus: There is a famous adventurer who once went exploring all over Liyue, documenting his whole journey.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 27.ogg Cyrus: Thanks to the notes he took of each location that he went, young adventurers are now able to plan ahead and avoid the dangers there. What is the name of this adventurer?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Learning from experience, writing diaries... It seems like adventuring requires constant self-reflection, just like studying.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Regarding this adventurer... I do believe I have read about him. He even made his mark on Dragonspine. Yes, it must be him... Hmm... Oh, what was his name...?
 Wilde.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 29.ogg Cyrus: Ooh, what a pity... You were so close, but not quite close enough. Never mind, eh.
 Sayid.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 29.ogg Cyrus: Ooh, what a pity... You were so close, but not quite close enough. Never mind, eh.
 Wyatt.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 29.ogg Cyrus: Ooh, what a pity... You were so close, but not quite close enough. Never mind, eh.
 Roald.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: That's it! It's Roald!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 28.ogg Cyrus: Correct! I had thought this question would be a little more challenging to adventurers from Mondstadt. Once again, Noelle, you never fail to impress.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 30.ogg Cyrus: Last question. Let's have some fun with this one. The most terrifying domain for adventurers from Mondstadt, the infamous windless land...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 31.ogg Cyrus: All that awaits you there is a sea of ashes and the deathly silence in the air... So, what is the name of this taboo territory?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: A sea of ashes... A windless land... What could it be...?
 Mare Safari.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 33.ogg Cyrus: Wrong answer! Huh... Was that supposed to be some sort of joke?
 Jare Mivani.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 33.ogg Cyrus: Wrong answer! Huh... Was that supposed to be some sort of joke?
 Mair Javiri.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 33.ogg Cyrus: Wrong answer! Huh... Was that supposed to be some sort of joke?
 Mare Jivari.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 32.ogg Cyrus: Correct! Keep this name in mind. Some day, you too will pass through this domain!
(If answered all questions correctly)

Media:vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Hahaha, that's three for three! As expected, these questions were no match for you.
(If answered at least one question incorrectly)

Media:vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Hmm... Are the questions too difficult? If even Noelle wasn't up to the task...
Media:vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Never mind, don't worry too much. This was just testing your rote learning ability, anyway. It wouldn't be much practical help on an adventure.
Media:vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: But be warned, things start to get a little trickier in the survival skills test!
Media:vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: Now, go and prepare yourselves. Meet me at Good Hunter when you think you're ready.

 Quest DescriptionAfter fully understanding Noelle's reasons for seeking him out, an elated and excited Cyrus decides to put you both through his new exam at the highest difficulty level.
(Head to Good Hunter and talk to Cyrus)
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Okay, let's begin with part two of the entrance exam.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Ready and willing, Mr. Cyrus.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Staying well-fed and making sure to prepare sufficient food supplies is a key survival skill for adventurers.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: That's why the second part of the exam is to prepare a food item fit for an emergency out in the wild. There are three criteria:
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Firstly, the ingredients must be easily accessible in the wilderness.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: Secondly, preparation and cooking must be quick and easy.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: Thirdly... Well, the food item in question must be able to help someone in dire straits to bounce back from the brink and regain their strength!
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 07.ogg Cyrus: So go ahead, cook something full of passion and packed with flavor! Just bring it to me whenever it's ready. Noelle... I await your dish with the greatest anticipation! Haha!
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Hmm... simple ingredients, easy to cook, helps you rally...
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), do you have any idea?
 Emergency Food.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Emergency Food...? Though I have never tried any, it doesn't sound like a specific dish... Let's think of something else.
 Mondstadt Grilled Fish.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Mondstadt Grilled Fish... You have a point. All it needs is a fish fillet and some pepper.
 Steak.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Steak? Good point! In a real emergency, all you'd need is a piece of meat... you wouldn't even need any seasoning.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Okay then. Once it's ready, let's take it over to Mr. Cyrus.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: We can always change our minds if we have a better idea. One must be careful not to act too hastily when taking an exam.
(Talk to Cyrus and give him the dish that meets his requirements)
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: ...Oh, you're ready to go? Don't be too hasty, now. You still have time to prepare, use it wisely.
(If Mondstadt Grilled Fish is given)

Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: *sniff* Mondstadt Grilled Fish, if I'm not mistaken? The fragrance is certainly rather rejuvenating.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: So... Mondstadt Grilled Fish... is the correct answer?
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Well, uh, the issue is... many people can't eat fish that hasn't been seasoned with plenty of pepper.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: I, for one, am quite happy to eat it straight from the grill with no seasoning at all... But basically, I think there are more straightforward dishes available.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Oh, I see... I'm sorry, I didn't take that into consideration...
(If the player passed the first test)

Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Ah, don't get down in the dumps! I've saved the best part of the exam for last.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: Go get yourself ready and meet me at Brightcrown Canyon.
(If the player failed the first test)

Hangout Failed
(If Steak is given)

Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Steak! Steak! Hahaha, hands down the top choice of a true adventurer!
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Simple ingredients, high nutritious, and most importantly, all you need to cook it is an open flame!
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Mm... And when it's not an emergency, adding a bit of seasoning makes it even better. Succulent and juicy, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside... The perfect accompaniment to an alcoholic beverage...
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Really?
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: If you like it so much, I can always make a few more!
 This was all a ploy to get Noelle to cook some drunk food for you...
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Ahaha, not at all! I was merely contemplating having a celebratory libation on Noelle's behalf.
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: In any case, congratulation on passing part two of the exam! Up next is the final stage.
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: Go get yourself ready, then meet me at Brightcrown Canyon.

(Talk to Cyrus at Brightcrown Canyon)
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Ad astra abyssosque, and welcome to the third and final part of your exam. Are you ready?
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Please... begin. I am ready.
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Good! Now. The most important skillset for an adventurer is, of course... combat skills!
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Ferocious monsters, dangerous machines... Only in the heat of the battle against your enemy does that surge of adrenaline really kick in!
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: This is the last part of the exam... Defeat the nearby Ruin Guard as quickly as you can.
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: I will be watching from here. Give it all you've got, Noelle!
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Okay! This time... I am confident I will pass!
(Talk to Cyrus again)
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: Go for it, Noelle! Remember, keep track of your time!

Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: *catches breath*
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Honorary Knight! I did it!
 This is all the result of your hard work.
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Not entirely... whenever I've taken an exam in the past, I always get nervous and I can't control it.
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: I know that it's just like in training, but I always end up worrying I might fail...
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: But not this time... This time, it seems I was able to remain calm.
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Somehow, having you by my side is... soothing...
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: It must be because you are here with me that I was able to complete the exam.
 No, Noelle. It's because you have what it takes.
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Thank you, thank you...
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: ...On the day of the real exam, if — and I mean only if...
 I will have time.
 I will be there.
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: Great! Maybe, just maybe, things will be different this time...
 
(Talk to Cyrus)
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Oh, back already? Seems like...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Even the third part of the exam is a walk in the park for you!
(Failed to defeat opponent within the time limit)

Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Ohhhh...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: In the end, I... I couldn't do it...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: My palms were sweating, and my heart was racing, and...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: I know that it's just like in training, but still, I always end up worrying I might fail...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: And in the end, I couldn't even solve the problem at hand...
 It's not because you lack the ability...
 It's because you were too fixated on the formality of the exam...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: But if I cannot perform well in an exam, what good is my ability...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: *sigh* Maybe... I should train some more...
 
(Talk to Cyrus)
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Oh, back already? Seems like...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Hmm... Maybe the difficulty level is too high after all...

Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Now, please allow me to announce the results of your adventurer's entrance examination...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: ...You passed with a perfect score! Noelle, you are incredible, as always!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: It's all because... I had an Honorary Knight by my side...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: Without further ado, it gives me great pleasure to officially grant you the title of adventurer!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 07.ogg Cyrus: May your days ahead be filled with adventure, and may you boldly explore the stars above and the abyss below! Ad astra abyssosque! Hahaha!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 08.ogg Cyrus: My, my, I never thought I'd see the day when Noelle would finally come around to the idea of joining the Adventurers' Guild...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Oh — oh Mr. Cyrus, I... I'm terribly sorry, but actually, I...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 09.ogg Cyrus: There's no need to talk like an outsider anymore! From now on, you can call me Branch Master, and I will call you Adventurer!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: I'm very sorry, but... I actually wasn't planning to join the Adventurers' Guild at all.
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: I just wanted to take an exam, so I could get used to the atmosphere... I thought it might help me better prepare for the Knights of Favonius selection exam.
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 10.ogg Cyrus: Ah? You mean...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 11.ogg Cyrus: How... How can this be? I was just about to recommend you to the perfect Adventure Team...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 12.ogg Cyrus: Wh—Why not give it some more thought? Even if you're not ready to be a full-time adventurer, you'd be more than welcome to help out every now and then.
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 13.ogg Cyrus: Just think of it as, uh... Ah, yes, think of it as part of your exam preparation!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 14.ogg Cyrus: You know, if you think about it, adventurers have a lot in common with the Knights... both want to defend Mondstadt!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: ...Exam preparation? ...Defend Mondstadt?
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 15.ogg Cyrus: Yes, precisely! I assure you it won't take up too much of your time. I believe it's only around four commissions per day...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Four commissions... M—Maybe if I can squeeze out some time from my breaks...
 Noelle, stay strong!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Argh, if I'm not careful the urge to accommodate just takes over...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: I'm sorry, Mr. Cyrus. But I'm afraid that my answer is still—
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 16.ogg Cyrus: Please, Noelle! I'm begging you, we need your help!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Ooh, uhh... Well, if my assistance is required...
 Noelle, let's go back and do some studying!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: Ohh... Okay! Sorry, Mr. Cyrus, maybe next time!

Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Now, please allow me to announce the results of your adventurer's entrance examination...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 17.ogg Cyrus: ...You successfully passed the exam! And you were so close to getting a perfect score... It feels like a missed opportunity...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 18.ogg Cyrus: But... if even Noelle could not get a perfect score, then maybe... I still need to adjust the difficulty level a little further...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 19.ogg Cyrus: Yes, the barrier to entry must be lowered to cater to the newcomers, then we can raise the difficulty at a later stage... Only in this way can we successfully attract newcomers...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: I... I didn't get a perfect score...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 20.ogg Cyrus: Hey now, first things first! Allow me to congratulate you on what was nevertheless a sterling performance in your exam! I will have Katheryne handle the admission process for you right away...

Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: ...Where did I go wrong? Is there any hope for me to improve? If I could start over...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: Oh, I'm sorry... Mr. Cyrus, what were you saying just now? I was a little lost in my own thoughts...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 22.ogg Cyrus: Huh... I was about to ask whether you would have the time to visit the Guild with me...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: I do apologize, Mr. Cyrus... I must get back to my exam preparation.
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: If I don't review my mistakes, I will only repeat them the next time I run into the same problem...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: It seems... I still have lots to learn...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: I will head back to the library now, and continue studying!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 23.ogg Cyrus: N—Noelle? You... you already passed your exam. What do you need to study for? Sure, you made a few mistakes, but this is an overreaction...
 Here's the situation...
You explain everything to Cyrus...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 24.ogg Cyrus: ...I see. *sigh* Well, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), when you get back, would you mind going to the library and checking on Noelle?
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 25.ogg Cyrus: I hope my exam hasn't affected her mood...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 26.ogg Cyrus: How can I get the exam to the right difficulty level? Hmm... I should go back to the Angel's Share and give this some careful consideration over an alcoholic beverage...
(Return to the library and find Noelle)

 Noelle... Are you okay?
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Ah... sorry, I zoned out a little... I didn't notice you there...
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: I've summarized my experiences from the mock exam and created a new reading list...
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: "Getting to Know Mondstadt's Geography" and "A One-Minute History of Adventuring in Mondstadt"... There is so much I can learn from them.
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Then there's "Eating Well in Mondstadt"... I never realized there were so many ways to cook in the wild.
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: And also "Self Defense: The Art of Down-to-Earth Dialogue With Monsters"... The combat approach of adventurers is definitely worth further study.
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: The only thing is... There is so much to get through. Will I really be able to finish them all?
 Surely these topics won't be covered in the Knights' selection exam?
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: But, but... what if this is the one time they do come up? What then?
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: What if they ask me... How to rescue an adventurer... Or how best to collaborate with the Adventurers' Guild...
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: If I neglect these topics now... I may live to regret it later.
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: *sigh* It looks like every second I have between now and my exam is going to count.

Noelle's Study Notes[]

 Noelle's Study Notes
Noelle's Study Notes: "Windwheel Asters commonly found at Stormterror's Lair and Windrise," "Hit Ruin Guards in weak spots to gain upper hand"...
Noelle's Study Notes: Each and every new detail learned during the adventure is recorded in neat and tidy handwriting — though it starts to get messier as you go down the page.
Noelle's Study Notes: Some vague descriptions are closely followed by precise annotations adding further detail. This seems to be evidence of the writer fighting a valiant battle against sleepiness.

Treasure Rumors[]
 Quest DescriptionGorou says that his box is at the Adventurers' Guild. Go with him to ask Katheryne.

(Ask Katheryne about the fate of the box)
You tell Katheryne about how Gorou is looking for a box he buried.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 katheryne 01.ogg Katheryne: Hmm, I'm afraid that will be a little difficult...
 Why, what's happened?
 Has the box gone?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 katheryne 02.ogg Katheryne: Don't worry, the item you are looking for is safe and sound. However, I'm unable to return it to you at present.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 katheryne 03.ogg Katheryne: The reason being, it is connected to a case involving the Treasure Hoarders, which is still under investigation.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: That's strange... I buried that box there — what does it have to do with the Treasure Hoarders?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 katheryne 04.ogg Katheryne: Allow me to explain. Not long ago, we received a commission concerning a theft by Treasure Hoarders at Komore Teahouse.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 katheryne 05.ogg Katheryne: The adventurer who accepted the commission followed their trail, and heard that they had buried the treasure at Nazuchi Beach.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 katheryne 06.ogg Katheryne: But when we went to dig up the stolen items, we found many other things buried there along with them. As such, we cannot ascertain which of the items have to do with the Treasure Hoarders at this stage.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 katheryne 07.ogg Katheryne: For now, all we can do is hold all related items at the Adventurers' Guild until such a time as we have caught the group of Treasure Hoarders in question. Then, we will see that all items are returned to their rightful owners.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: I see... I never expected that other people would be burying things in the same place.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: Well, since these are the rules, I won't press you for it. But might I ask how the investigation is coming along?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 katheryne 08.ogg Katheryne: This is where the difficulty arises. To date, we have still not been able to locate the hiding place of the Treasure Hoarders, so I'm afraid it still could take some time.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: So there's no knowing when this will be resolved...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: Maybe I could help? I could find the Treasure Hoarders for you, and once you confirm everything is in order, you'll be able to return my box to me.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: It's very important to me, so the sooner I get it back, the better.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 katheryne 09.ogg Katheryne: That is perfectly acceptable.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 katheryne 10.ogg Katheryne: However, many adventurers have investigated this case recently. They have searched far and wide, but their efforts have been fruitless.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 katheryne 11.ogg Katheryne: If the two of you are still interested in taking the case, you may have to devise an original approach...
 Let's head to Komore Teahouse first.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: Yes, it seems like the only sensible place to start.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: With any luck, we might be able to find some clues there... actually, since it's come up — what's the Komore Teahouse like?
 A place to have tea.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: Well obviously, hehe, anyway...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: Let's go take a look.
 It's actually a hot pot place.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Hot pot? So they call it a teahouse, despite the fact that it is obviously a hot pot restaurant... How confusing.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: Anyway, let's go take a look.

 Step DescriptionYou never expected that the box would be become embroiled in a theft case involving the Treasure Hoarders. Well then. Time to bring them to justice.

(Go to Komore Teahouse to investigate)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 kozue 01.ogg Kozue: ...Are you here to investigate the recent theft as well?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 kozue 02.ogg Kozue: We're grateful for the assistance. However, I'm afraid I don't have any more clues...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 kozue 03.ogg Kozue: It was Taroumaru's No. 2 Reserve Fund that they stole. They struck late at night while there was no one in the surrounding area, so they could slip in unnoticed.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 kozue 04.ogg Kozue: By the time we realized, it was too late.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 kozue 05.ogg Kozue: They left enough clues for us to retrieve the box, but we've found no trace of the group of Treasure Hoarders who dared to target our teahouse.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 kozue 06.ogg Kozue: I've asked around many times, and there were no eyewitnesses at all. We're definitely dealing with experienced crooks here...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 taroumaru 01.ogg Taroumaru: Woof!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 kozue 07.ogg Kozue: Taroumaru? What are you doing out here?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 taroumaru 02.ogg Taroumaru: Woof! Woof, woof!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 kozue 08.ogg Kozue: How strange. I don't know what's gotten into Taroumaru today...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: He says he knows where the Treasure Hoarders are hiding.
 You understand Taroumaru?
 Does that mean that you're a...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: How can I describe it... It's like listening to a regional dialect. A lot of it goes over my head, but I can still get the general gist.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: Anyway, he says he was there at the scene of the crime. The Treasure Hoarders didn't see Taroumaru as a threat, so he stayed and listened in on their whole conversation.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Since there were so many of them, and they were armed, Taroumaru didn't dare to bark loudly. So he just had to let them go.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 kozue 09.ogg Kozue: No wonder!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 kozue 10.ogg Kozue: Poor boy, he's been acting more anxious than usual lately, and is always looking outside. And I thought he just wanted someone to take him for a walk...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 taroumaru 03.ogg Taroumaru: Woof... woof, woof! Woof, woof, woof!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: Yes... that does sound like quite a predicament.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 taroumaru 04.ogg Taroumaru: Woof! Woof, woof! Woof!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: Okay, I think I understand now.
 I don't...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: Taroumaru says he heard the Treasure Hoarders conspiring to hide out at the beach directly below Tenshukaku.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: No one usually thinks to look there, and it's become something of a safe haven for Treasure Hoarders.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: He also mentioned that they were a gang of five people, the leader's name is Kousuke, and the second-in-command is called Yasuhisa. The leader's scent indicated he was probably from the Narukami Island area, while the two newcomers in the team were more likely from somewhere else.
 You got all that from "woof"!?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: Thank you, Taroumaru. It must have been hard for you, knowing the details of the crime but not being able to communicate them.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Don't you worry, we'll take care of everything from here. We will definitely get your belongings back!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902802 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: Let's go there in person, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). We might not have any troops with us, but between the two of us, we should be able to deal with a handful of petty thieves.

(Talk to Kozue again)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 kozue 01.ogg Kozue: That gang of Treasure Hoarders must have been planning this for a long time. Judging by how skillfully they infiltrated this place and the fact that they've managed to remain hidden ever since, it is clear that they are a group of seasoned thieves.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 kozue 02.ogg Kozue: But our own negligence is also to blame. We shouldn't have re-allocated so many people to other duties...

The Goods Returned[]

(Go to the place indicated by Taroumaru)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: Shh... I think we're getting close.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902801 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: There is danger in the air... and something doesn't smell right. Be careful!
(Defeat the Treasure Hoarders)

(After the battle)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902803 kousuke 01.ogg Kousuke: This is bizarre... how would anyone think to look here?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902803 yasuhisa 01.ogg Yasuhisa: Uh, Boss, didn't you say that the most dangerous place is the safest place to hide...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902803 kousuke 02.ogg Kousuke: Yeah, and I still maintain that I'm right in principle... Think how many days we've been here — no one else has come looking for us, have they?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902803 kousuke 03.ogg Kousuke: I can't believe we got caught, just when the whole thing had nearly blown over... Hey, kid, who the heck are you guys, anyway?
 Just some people fighting for justice in Inazuma.
 Taroumaru's best buddies!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902803 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: We shouldn't waste any more time on these people.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902803 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Life is tough in the resistance, but none of our troops would ever think about laying a hand on the innocent civilians under their rule. You have things so much better here, and this is how you choose to live your life? It's pure selfishness.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902803 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), we should turn them over to the Adventurers' Guild right away. Once their identities are confirmed, they'll get the punishment they deserve.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902803 kousuke 04.ogg Kousuke: Please, show a little mercy!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902803 kousuke 05.ogg Kousuke: We'll give you half of everything we've saved up over the years... If you're willing to turn a blind eye on this, anything's up for negotiation...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902803 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: That's enough. Tie them up and take them away!
 Yes, Sir!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902803 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: Oh! Uh... Come to think of it, this is not a military camp, so there's no need for me to be so heavy-handed.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902803 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: But thieves still have to be punished. (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), let's escort them back.

Reminiscence[]
 Step DescriptionYou've got the box, but Gorou seems to want to return to Watatsumi Island before opening it...

(Deliver the Treasure Hoarders back to the Adventurers' Guild)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902804 katheryne 01.ogg Katheryne: I am pleased to confirm that these are indeed the individuals who stole from Komore Teahouse.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902804 katheryne 02.ogg Katheryne: I didn't expect you to catch them so quickly, especially with no new leads to explore.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902804 katheryne 03.ogg Katheryne: In accordance with the rules, now that we have procured an oral confession from the Treasure Hoarders and verified the list of stolen items, we can now return the box to you.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902804 katheryne 04.ogg Katheryne: Here, please take it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902804 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Ah... Thank goodness.
 Are you going to open it and take a look?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902804 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Let me think... the contents of the box don't belong here — they belong on Watatsumi Island.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902804 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: So let's head there now and open it.

(Return to Watatsumi Island)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902805 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: One, two, three... yes, it looks like they're all here.
 What are these?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902805 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Some personal items that once belonged to troops under my command.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902805 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: Water bottles, towels, knee guards... Just everyday items, but each one bears the handwritten name of its former owner. These were the only things those soldiers had for their families to remember them by.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902805 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: We all knew going into that battle that the odds of survival were slim. Many of the soldiers came to me and said they wanted to leave something behind as a keepsake for their loved ones.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902805 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: You see, their swords and polearms broke in battle, their damaged armor wouldn't have been easy to carry, and many of them couldn't write very well, so they couldn't even leave a letter...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902805 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: In the end, all they could leave to their families were these ordinary items. Artifacts of their daily lives.
 Gorou...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902805 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: My soldiers trusted me, but I failed to lead them to victory that day.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902805 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: Then they trusted me with these... and instead of honoring their last wishes right away, I had to hastily bury them in the sand...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902805 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: Every time something like this happens, I tell myself that by the next time I'm faced with the same situation, I have to be stronger.
 You got the box back. It's alright now.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902805 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: Yeah... but right now, let me just mourn them for a little while longer.

 Quest DescriptionYou accompany Kaveh back to his place, where he digs out a number of mementos from his childhood. Are there any interesting stories behind these simple objects?

(Enter Alhaitham's Home)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Alhaitham isn't in, so feel free to sit wherever. I'll bring out the box.
Kaveh brings out a box and dusts it off...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: *sigh*
 What's wrong?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: Oh, nothing. I just didn't realize how much time had passed. The box is pretty dusty, which means it's already been a while since I've moved into this place... and many years since my mother moved to Fontaine.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: I'm happy for her. I hope she'll be able to find happiness there. She raised me all by herself after my father passed away. It definitely wasn't easy for her.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: Anyway, enough about that, let's see what I packed into this box. Uh, what are all these things...
(An image of a building appears)

 Is that a... drawing?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Oh, I remember now. This is a drawing I made in Port Ormos.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Obviously, I wouldn't call it anything special now, but I was less than five years old when I made this drawing. That's more than twenty years ago... Heh, you could say it's pretty good for a child of that age.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: Hmm, now that I've said that out loud, I suppose I do have some level of artistic talent, right?
 Why do you say that?
 You don't sound as confident as you used to be.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: Criticism and self-doubt have always been a part of the artistic process. Without criticism, there can be no improvement. It's normal for me to question my abilities from time to time.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: I admit that I may have spent a little too long questioning myself this time around, but as you know, the heart tends to dwell on whatever it pleases...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: *sigh* Anyway, never mind... The more I talk about it, the less confident I feel. Let's see what else we have in the box.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: Ah, my building blocks... it's been years since I've last seen these. When I was a kid, I used to stack them super high, and could even stabilize the tower to keep it from tumbling over.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: Oh, and this blueprint... Haha, I made it by copying my mother's sketch, and the aspect ratio was horrendous. It's still technically the first blueprint I made myself, though.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: I was super proud of myself when I finished it, and put it in the same pile as my mother's sketches, hoping she'd notice and compliment me for my good work.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: Unfortunately, my mother didn't realize that I had put it there. When she had a meeting with a client the next day, she handed my blueprint to him by mistake. The client was completely confused by this "new" blueprint, but apparently he felt too tongue-tied to question such a famous architect.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: It was only a few days later that he finally gathered up the courage to pay my mother a visit. He asked, "the door in this blueprint is even taller than the roof... Is this supposed to be part of the design?"
 And what happened after that?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: My mother took me with her to personally apologize to the client several times.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: She didn't scold me about it in private, though. Instead, she went over all the steps required to draw a good blueprint, and was very patient throughout the whole process. I still remember it like it was yesterday.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: Hmm... let's see, is there anything else left in this box? ...Huh, what was this again?
(A book appears)

 A notebook with a lock?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 20.ogg Kaveh: Ah, this is my mother's notebook. She used to write and sketch in it all the time.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 21.ogg Kaveh: When I was a child, I used to be super fascinated by this notebook, and always pestered my mother to let me read it. After asking her a few times, she told me that I could read it as long as I could guess the password.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 22.ogg Kaveh: Huh, wonder why she didn't take this notebook with her... Did she leave it to me on purpose?
 You could open it and take a look.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 23.ogg Kaveh: Hah, if only I could... I never managed to guess the password.
 Even after all those years?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 24.ogg Kaveh: Hey, it's not a matter of time, it's a matter of inspiration! That's what we need to guess the password.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 25.ogg Kaveh: Who knows, maybe this time, something will click in my head, and the answer will just present itself. Let me think, hmm... what could it be...?
 Your name?
 Your birthday?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 26.ogg Kaveh: Haha, I could tell what you were thinking. Don't worry, I tried all the easy guesses a long time ago.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 27.ogg Kaveh: I've tried my name, my father's name, my mother's name, my grandparents' names on both sides, and all of our birthdays... I've tried every name and number remotely related to my family.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 28.ogg Kaveh: I've even tried stuff like "LOVEYOUKAVEH," "TAKECARE," and "YOURSTRULY." I've tried every cheesy phrase and well wish in the book, but this lock has refused to budge.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 29.ogg Kaveh: I wouldn't try that route again... I have a hunch that it won't be that simple. Also, if she really did use something like that, she'd never hear the end of it from the folks over at Haravatat if they ever found out.
 We can try asking some of her old acquaintances... (This dialogue option leads to Wondrous Times.)
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 35.ogg Kaveh: So we could find someone who was close to my mother, and see if they might know anything? Hmm, I see what you're saying... But who should we talk to for that?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 36.ogg Kaveh: My mother was never really the one to be social. My father was the one with more friends, but all of those connections were severed when he died.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 37.ogg Kaveh: Let me think... Is there still someone at the Akademiya who would know my mother... Ah, actually, there is someone. Professor Zaha Hadi.
 Who is that?
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 38.ogg Kaveh: Huh, you've really never heard of her? She's a famous Kshahrewar scholar, and leading expert in formal garden design. My mother studied under her as a student many years ago.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 39.ogg Kaveh: Professor Zaha Hadi published many works during her career, so I was also able to learn a lot by studying her essays. If there's anyone who still remembers my mom, it'd be her.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 40.ogg Kaveh: She's older now and is no longer teaching at the Akademiya. If I remember correctly, she spends most of her time around the Bimarstan area.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 41.ogg Kaveh: Let's go take a look. We might run into her if we're lucky.
(Go to Wondrous Times)
 Then maybe we should just put it aside for now. (This dialogue option leads to The First Ideal.)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 30.ogg Kaveh: ...Yeah, you're right. Although I was hoping to find some words of wisdom from my mother, if I stop and think about it, her words may not be the advice that I need to hear right at this moment.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 31.ogg Kaveh: Everyone's life journey is different. Traveler, you've visited many lands and met many people, so I'm sure you've run into situations where some advice wasn't exactly suitable for the situation at hand.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 32.ogg Kaveh: Ah, I just got an idea, though. If I want to rekindle the creative passion that I had before, instead of trying to unlock an old notebook, why don't I take a walk around the parts of town that had changed my life?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 33.ogg Kaveh: What do you think?
 Sounds good to me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 34.ogg Kaveh: I'm glad you agree. Then let's start by taking a quick stroll around the Akademiya.
(Go to The First Ideal)

 Quest DescriptionBeidou invites you to experience the survival knowledge training conducted by The Shield of The Crux. Learn something about illnesses experienced on the high seas with Yinxing, the surgeon at sea.
Training: The Shield of the Crux[]

(Talk to Beidou before talking to the rest)
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 01.ogg Beidou: I can't wait to see how you perform.
(Learn from Yinxing)
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 01.ogg Yinxing: Hello, Traveler. I am Yinxing, The Crux's surgeon at sea.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 02.ogg Yinxing: Whenever a sailor has a health problem, they come to me. I deal with it all — from seasickness and common colds, to amputations, and everything in between.
 I'd like to learn about treating injuries and illnesses at sea.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 03.ogg Yinxing: Oh, I presume the Captain arranged this, correct? Alright then, let's begin.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 04.ogg Yinxing: First of all, let me ask you this. What do you think is the biggest danger that all new crew members face?
 Getting seasick?
 Catching a cold?
 Losing a limb?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 05.ogg Yinxing: That can certainly be a problem at sea, but it's not the biggest danger. The most dangerous thing for a newcomer is to underestimate the dangers of life at sea.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 06.ogg Yinxing: I have seen many new crew members who see themselves as young and fighting fit and have no regard for safety. They think that since they are tough enough to look after themselves on land, they'll be fine at sea as well.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 07.ogg Yinxing: Those are the ones that always end up in the sick bay. Everyone should know that being a sailor, especially on a long voyage, is a brutal job in an unforgiving environment.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 08.ogg Yinxing: We have to face malnutrition when we're short on supplies, all kinds of injuries and diseases that the harsh ocean weather can bring...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 09.ogg Yinxing: ...and even the psychological problems that can arise due to isolation and the lack of entertainment.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 10.ogg Yinxing: To make things worse, the lack of medication and treatment options at sea can result in even minor health problems becoming serious, or even fatal...
 Hence, the need for amputations...?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 11.ogg Yinxing: Haha, you probably thought I was joking, right? That's not surprising. Most newcomers think the same way.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 12.ogg Yinxing: But hopefully you now realize that with a little extra precaution, a lot of these things can be avoided...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 13.ogg Yinxing: Well, I think that's enough for you to think over for now.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 14.ogg Yinxing: Is there anything else you would like to know?
 What's Beidou's view on this?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 15.ogg Yinxing: Captain Beidou?... Out of everyone I have met, she probably values people's lives and safety the most.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 16.ogg Yinxing: Although I'm just a doctor, Beidou has given me the full authority to send any newcomers who I don't see as fit for service off the ship until they are ready to come back with the right attitude.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 17.ogg Yinxing: Every time we're stocking up before a voyage, medicine takes top priority. I'm even allowed to choose the suppliers regardless of the price, we have adequate budget for medical expenses.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 18.ogg Yinxing: Do you know what Mora-Grubber, our bookkeeper, calls this?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 19.ogg Yinxing: A significant financial risk. Hehe.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 20.ogg Yinxing: But Beidou knows the importance of having a healthy crew. That's why she has authorized me regardless.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 21.ogg Yinxing: She places her full trust in me and believes that I can solve these problems... Of course, I have proven her right.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 22.ogg Yinxing: So, to answer your question, that's how she thinks!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 14.ogg Yinxing: Is there anything else you would like to know?
(Return to option selection)
 What happens to the crew members who have had limbs amputated?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 23.ogg Yinxing: Hmm? Are you concerned about them? No wonder Captain Beidou thinks you are different, there must be more to you than just your strength.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 24.ogg Yinxing: If you can convince Mora-Grubber to show you the books, you'll see there is a regular fixed cost, titled "Convalescence Payments and Incapacity Support for Injured Crew Members."
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 25.ogg Yinxing: Regardless of the fleet's income, those who have fought alongside us will certainly receive their compensation every year.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 26.ogg Yinxing: Some of those that have returned to land have started small businesses, while others have chosen to go out traveling the world.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 27.ogg Yinxing: The money is intended to allow them to live their lives as freely as possible. I'm sure being based on land helps a lot with that, too...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 28.ogg Yinxing: Still, we can't pretend like it solves everything. They call them life-changing injuries for a reason, you know?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 29.ogg Yinxing: But if nothing else, it's good to know that while Captain Beidou is in charge of The Crux, no one will get forgotten.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 14.ogg Yinxing: Is there anything else you would like to know?
(Return to option selection)
 Thanks. I've learned a lot.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 yinxing 30.ogg Yinxing: My pleasure. Okay, let's leave it there, then. Be sure to take good care of your health.
(Talk to Yinxing again)
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 yinxing 01.ogg Yinxing: Be sure to take good care of yourself.
(Consult Huixing the navigator)
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 01.ogg Huixing: Sorry about earlier, Traveler...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 02.ogg Huixing: We were so caught up on getting you to join the fleet that we didn't notice we were going a little overboard... Good thing the Captain stepped in.
 It's okay. I was hoping to learn a little more about cartography.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 03.ogg Huixing: Oh! Well, in that case, you have come to the right person. I'm not just blowing smoke, you're looking at the most talented navigator in Liyue Harbor.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 04.ogg Huixing: I'll start by introducing some chart-reading essentials for new sailors. Feel free to interrupt if you have any questions.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 05.ogg Huixing: Let's start with what to look for when you get a set of complicated charts.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 06.ogg Huixing: First, you should always look at any indicated shorelines, islands or reefs, water depths, hydrological conditions, and other hazards.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 07.ogg Huixing: With these features in mind, you can answer the basic question of "can I chart a safe course through this area."
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 08.ogg Huixing: Visually, nautical charts are a little unique. Unlike land maps, most charts do not have a fixed scale, which means that it can be hard to precisely determine the exact distance between two points.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 09.ogg Huixing: The most advanced nautical charts come with a supplementary chart, which has different colored lines marked on it to indicate distances.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 10.ogg Huixing: It's worth mentioning that under my direction, The Crux is using these advanced kinds of charts!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 11.ogg Huixing: Some cartographers mark out other points of interest on their charts, usually with their own special symbols. If they don't leave any accompanying notes, they can be very difficult to interpret.
 For example, charts inherited from the previous navigator?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 12.ogg Huixing: Haha, not only those. We have tattered and torn charts that we've picked up from all over the place.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 13.ogg Huixing: To be honest, it can be quite a challenge, even for me. Some of these charts are really old and have symbols that I have never seen before...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 14.ogg Huixing: But if we don't decipher them, we will certainly miss many secrets of the sea.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 15.ogg Huixing: Fortunately, we have the Captain with us. She managed to find some ancient books on semiotics that I can use to study the charts further.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 16.ogg Huixing: I don't think anyone other than our Captain could manage to get these kinds of resources. Old charts and ancient books on semiotics are not the kinds of things that are sold in your average marketplace...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 17.ogg Huixing: Oops! I've gotten off-topic, hehe. Well, that just about covers the basics of chart-reading.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 18.ogg Huixing: Is there anything else you would like to know, Traveler?
 Do you have experience drafting nautical charts?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 19.ogg Huixing: Drafting charts? That's certainly a more advanced topic. To be honest, I've only attained a smattering of knowledge in that area.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 20.ogg Huixing: The charts we are using now are just revised versions of the ones left by the previous navigator.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 21.ogg Huixing: So my mapping experiences have been primarily limited to updating our charts to reflect changes in the sea.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 22.ogg Huixing: I think you can ask Captain Beidou more about cartography.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 23.ogg Huixing: One time, the fleet sailed into an uncharted area by mistake. It wasn't long before we turned the fleet around and returned the way we came out for fear of potential hazards.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 24.ogg Huixing: But Captain Beidou still managed to draft a simple chart of the area we sailed through for if and when we explore the area again.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 25.ogg Huixing: Incredible, isn't it? I was amazed to see that the Captain could even do cartography.
 Then why does she need you as a navigator?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 26.ogg Huixing: Because I have the talent, and she doesn't want to let it go to waste. Hehe. She treats the whole crew that way.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 27.ogg Huixing: I initially had the same question myself. After all, in many fleets the captain also works as the navigator. I couldn't understand her reasoning at the time, so I asked her.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 28.ogg Huixing: She just laughed and told me to wise up, saying that even Rex Lapis never fights alone.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 29.ogg Huixing: She wants everyone onboard to master their role, so that The Crux is not floating on her alone.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 30.ogg Huixing: That way, if the day ever comes when she's no longer with the fleet, we will still be able to sail onward without her.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 31.ogg Huixing: Captain Beidou may seem aloof and even act careless sometimes, but the truth is that she's very considerate of everyone onboard.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 18.ogg Huixing: Is there anything else you would like to know, Traveler?
(Return to option selection)
 Nothing else, thank you.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 32.ogg Huixing: My pleasure. A friend of Captain Beidou is a friend of mine!
(Talk to Huixing again)
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 huixing 01.ogg Huixing: One day, I will decipher all these symbols.
(Learn a thing or two from Xu Liushi)
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 01.ogg Xu Liushi: Hello, Traveler. Are you here to learn about marine meteorology?
 Wait, how did you know?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 02.ogg Xu Liushi: Haha, in my line of work, I've got to have a pair of sharp eyes.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 03.ogg Xu Liushi: I saw the captain showing you around the training grounds, and then you went to see Yinxing and Huixing.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 04.ogg Xu Liushi: So, I figured that she probably wants you to get to know the life of a crew member.
 You have a real knack for your work.
 Looks like Beidou got the right person for the job.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 05.ogg Xu Liushi: Hehe! Okay, let's get started. First, I'll introduce you to the basics of meteorology.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 06.ogg Xu Liushi: Marine meteorology basically means keeping tabs on the weather as well as other ocean phenomena, so things like sea fog, storm surges, waterspouts, and so on...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 07.ogg Xu Liushi: These are all potential threats to safe navigation. Luckily, whatever weather might be coming up, there's always some kind of sign that gives it away in advance.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 08.ogg Xu Liushi: Take waterspouts for example. They're caused by high-speed rotating winds on the surface of the ocean. They can engulf large ships and do immense damage.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 09.ogg Xu Liushi: But, if you know that waterspouts can only form in an environment with high temperature, high humidity, and large clouds, then you can be well-prepared.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 10.ogg Xu Liushi: You will be even more alert if you also know that the presence of winds blowing in opposite directions with a significant difference in speed is a direct precursor to the formation of waterspouts.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 11.ogg Xu Liushi: And most importantly, if you spot a small white vortex emerging from the clouds, you should immediately notify the crew to steer clear of what's ahead.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 12.ogg Xu Liushi: So there you go, those are the warning signs of waterspouts. I am proud to say that, over the years, I haven't let a single one sneak up on my watch.
 You must have sharp eyesight.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 13.ogg Xu Liushi: Well, I'm good at reading the sea, but I'm not as good as the captain when it comes to reading people.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 14.ogg Xu Liushi: Do you know the small fishing village next to Wangshu Inn? I heard that when Captain was a kid, she worked there fishing with the adults.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 15.ogg Xu Liushi: Later, she made her way into the harbor, where she struggled to make a living. Heh, managing to survive in an environment like that as a kid is solid proof of the Captain's capabilities.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 16.ogg Xu Liushi: If it wasn't for her, I never would have dreamed of taking this job. She gave me confidence and told me I could do it.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 17.ogg Xu Liushi: You may not have heard, but I'm best known outside the Crux Fleet for a slightly infamous story involving me, Third-Round Knockout, and a few too many...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 18.ogg Xu Liushi: Who would ever have thought that the rookie sailor who fell drunk into the sea and became a laughingstock among their now-former crewmates would then go on to become a lookout for The Crux? But it's the unbelievable truth, haha.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 19.ogg Xu Liushi: It proves that having skills alone is not enough. You need someone like the Captain who is a good judge of character.
 Sounds like you have a lot of experience.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 20.ogg Xu Liushi: I've gotta confess, I learned almost everything I know from the Captain.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 21.ogg Xu Liushi: All the stuff about meteorology that I just told you about... she's the real expert.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 22.ogg Xu Liushi: Do you know the small fishing village next to Wangshu Inn? I heard that when Captain Beidou was a kid, she worked there, fishing.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 23.ogg Xu Liushi: Later, she made her way into the harbor, where she struggled to make a living. Heh, growing up in an environment like that, it's no wonder she knows everything about the sea.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 24.ogg Xu Liushi: When I first came onboard, I lived every day wallowing in doubt, wondering if my former career as a sailor was all just a waste.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 25.ogg Xu Liushi: But as I gradually learned some new things and became more experienced, I finally realized what makes The Crux so great.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 26.ogg Xu Liushi: After all, not every fleet has the "Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean" as their leader. I feel lucky just to have joined.
 Thanks for your time. I think I've learned all that I need for now.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 xuliushi 27.ogg Xu Liushi: Find me anytime if you want to know more.
(Talk to Xu Liushi again)
Media:vo bdcop001 1905104 xuliushi 01.ogg Xu Liushi: Find me anytime if you want to know more.

A Little Test[]

(Report back to Beidou)
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 02.ogg Beidou: Hmm? So you've already finished talking to the crew, huh? Heh, I thought it would take you a while longer. So, what did you think?
 It was a breeze. I've got everything down pat.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 03.ogg Beidou: You sound confident, but don't underestimate The Shield of The Crux.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 04.ogg Beidou: I gotta admit though, I like your attitude, kid. Okay, let's get started!
 It was a little hard, but I can handle it.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 05.ogg Beidou: Haha. Now you know that The Shield of The Crux is not such an easy job. Let's get started.
 It was pretty difficult. I'll need some time to review.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 06.ogg Beidou: Haha! There's that modesty of yours again, I didn't think that I'd ever hear the word "difficult" come out of your mouth. Come on, let's get on with it!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 07.ogg Beidou: First of all, life on the sea isn't always plain sailing. Injuries and illnesses happen all the time.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 08.ogg Beidou: But what is the single biggest danger facing crew members?
 Getting seasick.
 Cold weather.
 Underestimating danger.
(Correct answer)
 Amputations.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 09.ogg Beidou: Hmm? Is that your final answer? Haha! Alright, on to the second question.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 10.ogg Beidou: As you've just learned, the fleet plots its route using nautical charts. The charts used by The Crux have additional charts attached.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 11.ogg Beidou: The supplementary chart has lots of lines in various colors for added reference. What is the purpose of these lines?
 To add color and depth to the chart in a way that expresses the draughtsman's aesthetic preferences and fosters a greater appreciation of art among the crew.
 To mark distances.
(Correct answer)
 To mark special locations.
 To mark different types of currents.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 12.ogg Beidou: Okay, interesting, interesting. Now, last question...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 13.ogg Beidou: On longer voyages, we have to be especially careful to avoid certain weather hazards that pose a threat to the integrity of the ship and the lives of the crew. For example, waterspouts.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 14.ogg Beidou: So, my question is, how can we reliably predict waterspouts, so we can avoid them?
 The presence of dark clouds and strong winds in opposite directions, plus rings of white spots in the clouds.
 The presence of dark clouds and strong winds in opposite directions, plus white vortices in the clouds.
(Correct answer)
 When Sea Drake says a waterspout is coming, it's coming.
 When Liushi says a waterspout is coming, it's coming.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 15.ogg Beidou: Okay! Those are all my questions. Do you want to know how you did?

Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 46.ogg Beidou: Just kidding. I know you wouldn't do that. I guess you're just not really suited for life on the sea.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 47.ogg Beidou: In that case, how about we take a trip back to Liyue Harbor? Looks like you and the sea are not made for each other. Dry land is where you really come into your own.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 48.ogg Beidou: I've actually been hoping for the chance to give you an insider look at how some of The Crux's important business is conducted.

Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 17.ogg Beidou: You got them all correct. They weren't the most difficult questions, but they weren't ones you could bluff your way through, either. You've clearly been paying attention to my crew.

(Continues only if 2 or 3 correct answers were selected)
 Why learn recreational activities?
 To be clear, wrestling sea monsters bare-handed is not my idea of recreation...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 19.ogg Beidou: Hah! Don't worry, all our recreational activities are respectable and, uh, above-board.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 20.ogg Beidou: You need to realize that being out at sea might be fun for the first few days while everything's new, but before too long...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 21.ogg Beidou: ...looking at the same old sea every day and being so isolated from everything can really cause people to struggle mentally.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 22.ogg Beidou: That is why regular recreational activities are an absolute necessity.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 23.ogg Beidou: We offer a lot of fun courses for our newcomer training, including fishing, photography, chess...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 24.ogg Beidou: Oh! And thanks to Kazuha, these days we also offer poetry and music appreciation as well as communal wind listening...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 25.ogg Beidou: Each newcomer has to participate in at least one, so that they've got some way of keeping themselves occupied at sea further down the line.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 26.ogg Beidou: Of course, if you'd prefer wrestling sea monsters with your bare hands, that can be arranged.
 Now you're talking my language...
 I was just kidding...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 27.ogg Beidou: Hahaha, well, for today at least, let's stick to the training schedule drawn up by Juza.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905101 beidou 28.ogg Beidou: If I remember correctly, it should be photography today... Come on, I'll show you.

The Photography Crew[]

(Go to the photography class)
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 juza 01.ogg Juza: Listen up! Everyone can go back and call it a day! The photography session has been postponed.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 01.ogg Beidou: What's going on here, Juza?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 juza 02.ogg Juza: Oh, Captain! There you are!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 juza 03.ogg Juza: Well, Captain, the photography teacher just sent word saying that she's fallen ill and doesn't want to risk coming in, in case she keels over in class.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 02.ogg Beidou: I see, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). That's quite unfortunate...
 Captain, if I may, I know a little about photography.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 03.ogg Beidou: Oh? Quite the multi-talented one, aren't you.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 04.ogg Beidou: In that case, why don't you help us out and lead the class today?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 juza 04.ogg Juza: Yeah... unfortunately, the original teacher canceled at short notice, so there's no time to schedule anything else instead.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 juza 05.ogg Juza: It would be great if the Traveler could step in as the teacher for the day!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 05.ogg Beidou: It's up to you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
 It would be my pleasure.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 06.ogg Beidou: Great, it's settled then! Juza, let's muster everyone over here to meet the new teacher!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 juza 06.ogg Juza: Yes, Captain!
Juza gathers the excited crew to meet their new teacher.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 07.ogg Beidou: That should be everyone. Take it away, Traveler.
 Before I begin, I do have one condition.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 08.ogg Beidou: Oh yeah? What's that?
 Since this is a photography course, there has to be a subject. We will need a model.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 09.ogg Beidou: Fair enough. It seems like you already have someone in mind.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 10.ogg Beidou: So who will it be?
 I think the most suitable model is... Chief Mate Juza!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 juza 07.ogg Juza: Whoa? Me? You can't be serious! If a bad picture of a guy like me gets to the crew...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 juza 08.ogg Juza: I'm sure everyone will blame the photographer for doing a bad job. I'm just thinking about your reputation here, Traveler. You'd better find someone else...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 juza 09.ogg Juza: Ah, how about our Captain Beidou? I think she would be great.

 I think the most suitable model is... Yinxing!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 yinxing 02.ogg Yinxing: Huh, me? But, but... Oh actually! I just remembered that the legs of these new chairs that I purchased are a bit too long... so I should go take care of that immediately.
 Is it the doctor's job to amputate chairs, too?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 yinxing 03.ogg Yinxing: Uh... Anyway, I can't do it. I have things to do!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 yinxing 04.ogg Yinxing: I really should get going...

 Hmm... I think the most suitable model is... Xu Liushi!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 xuliushi 01.ogg Xu Liushi: Ah... Look at the horizon! There's a storm brewing in the distance...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 xuliushi 02.ogg Xu Liushi: But on a day like this... how is it possible? I guess I need to keep a good lookout today.
 Why can't you keep a lookout and attend class at the same time?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 xuliushi 03.ogg Xu Liushi: Haha, of course I can. But I think that's enough multitasking without adding modeling to the list, too.
(Goes back to dialogue selection)
 Hmm... I think the most suitable model is... Captain Beidou!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 11.ogg Beidou: Me? Ahahaha! Well, we could do that, or...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 12.ogg Beidou: Guyun Stone Forest looks extraordinary today, it'd be a pity not to capture the scenery for posterity.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 13.ogg Beidou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), so how about we snap Guyun Stone Forest for today's class? Then there'd be no need for a model... Ahem.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 juza 01.ogg Juza: Come on, Captain! We talked about this, the photography class is supposed to be portrait photography! Have you forgotten?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905104 juza 01.ogg Juza: "Scenery looks nice at first, but it gets boring after a while. I bet it'd keep the crew more entertained if we got them learning portrait photography, so they could record moments in each other's daily lives."
Media:vo bdcop001 1905105 juza 01.ogg Juza: Those were your exact words, Captain.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 01.ogg Beidou: Hehe... Were they, now? Strange, I don't seem to remember anything about that...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905104 beidou 01.ogg Beidou: Well then, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), in that case — how about Huixing? I bet she's perfect for the Kamera!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905105 beidou 01.ogg Beidou: Or Furong, or Mora-Grubber... even Little Yue!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 33.ogg Huixing: Seriously, Captain? Little Yue? You're just trying to wriggle your way out of this. This isn't like you!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 huixing 34.ogg Huixing: You are the captain, after all. Of all of us, you're the best suited to being a model.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 juza 10b.ogg Juza: I agree! You were the one who invited the Traveler to be the teacher, so you should cooperate, Captain.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 juza 11.ogg Juza: Besides, Captain, you've never had your photo taken. It's high time you got one. You know, a heroic and striking kind of picture!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 juza 12.ogg Juza: We can even use it to promote the fleet during recruitment...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 14.ogg Beidou: Real funny guys...
 Trust your crew, Captain. You are the best candidate.
 Trust me, Captain. You are the best candidate.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 15.ogg Beidou: Well, if you say so... I'm not one to spoil the fun.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 16.ogg Beidou: So what do I do now, Traveler?
 You can just strike an epic pose.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 17.ogg Beidou: Hmm... like this?
 Uh, you look a little nervous.
 Smile and be happy.

 Uh, you look a little stiff.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 19.ogg Beidou: Hah! You're kidding, right? I've never had my photo taken before, but something this simple shouldn't be a challenge for me.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 20.ogg Beidou: It must be... the lighting or something! You've got it wrong... Ahem.
 Perhaps you feel uncomfortable with so many people around?
 Perhaps you feel uncomfortable posing here?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 21.ogg Beidou: I never said that.
 We can go somewhere quieter.
 We can go somewhere with a better view.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 22.ogg Beidou: You mean go somewhere else and then bring the final photo back as teaching material?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 juza 13.ogg Juza: Sounds good to me, haha! That's a good idea, isn't it guys?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 23.ogg Beidou: Hmm, the lighting may still be a problem...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 24.ogg Beidou: But I'm open to persuasion. If you have a suitable place in mind, I can consider it...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 25.ogg Beidou: Just to be clear, I won't necessarily agree. It depends on the place you have in mind.
 How about Yaoguang Shoal? We can enjoy the ocean breeze...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 39.ogg Beidou: Well... Yaoguang Shoal is pretty relaxing.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 40.ogg Beidou: But if I want to enjoy the ocean breeze, why don't I just stay onboard The Alcor and enjoy the breeze with my crew? That'd be more fun if you ask me.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 41.ogg Beidou: So I think we can just forget the whole modeling thing for now.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 42.ogg Beidou: Sorry about that, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), I guess I'll owe you a favor!
(Ends the Hangout Event)
 How about the top of Mt. Tianheng, overlooking all of Liyue Harbor?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 34.ogg Beidou: A view overlooking Liyue Harbor, huh? Sounds nice, but...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 35.ogg Beidou: On second thought... I don't have any love for a lifeless gadget like the Kamera.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 36.ogg Beidou: I'd prefer to be having fun together with my crew! I guess I'm used to that rowdy bunch.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 37.ogg Beidou: So I think we can just forget the whole modeling thing for now.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 38.ogg Beidou: Sorry about that, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), I guess I'll owe you a favor!
(Ends the Hangout Event)
 I've heard there's a fishing village near Wangshu Inn...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 26.ogg Beidou: The fishing village near Wangshu Inn? That place is deserted now, isn't it?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 27.ogg Beidou: How do you even know that place anyway? It's tiny! I don't think I've ever seen it on a single map.
 I once found some treasure there.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 28.ogg Beidou: Haha, treasure? There? I guess I missed out on that one.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 29.ogg Beidou: It just so happens that that little village is where I grew up. And now that you've mentioned it, it's given me the urge to go back and take a look around.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 30.ogg Beidou: How about we take this opportunity to pay my old home a visit?
 Xu Liushi told me you once lived there.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 31.ogg Beidou: I'm surprised that you'd remember such a trivial detail.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 32.ogg Beidou: He's right though, I did live there for a while. And now that you've mentioned it, it's given me the urge to go back and take a look around.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905102 beidou 33.ogg Beidou: Well then, let's go. We can take this opportunity to pay my old home a visit.
(Proceed to The Nameless Fishing Village)

The Nameless Fishing Village[]

(Head to the fishing village near Wangshu Inn)
Media:vo bdcop001 1905105 beidou 02.ogg Beidou: Hmm. It's certainly seen better days...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905105 beidou 03.ogg Beidou: It was never that impressive, but at least back in the day it was a lively village and home to several families.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905105 beidou 04.ogg Beidou: I wonder how long these last few old houses will remain standing.
 So what exactly happened here?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905105 beidou 05.ogg Beidou: Nothing as dramatic as you might think. A few small incidents occurred and then people began to leave.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905105 beidou 06.ogg Beidou: C'mon, let's take a walk around.
(Take a stroll with Beidou in the fishing village)
Media:vo bdcop001 1905114 beidou 01.ogg Beidou: People used to call this place "Downriver," because the villagers apparently moved here from a place called "Upriver."
Media:vo bdcop001 1905114 beidou 02.ogg Beidou: With them, they brought their knowledge of fishing which had been passed down from generation to generation. I learned a lot from them when I was here.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905114 beidou 03.ogg Beidou: Now, Upriver is long gone and Downriver is all but deserted. It won't be long before no one even remembers what these places are called.

The Long Years[]

Media:vo bdcop001 1905106 beidou 01.ogg Beidou: "To Zhong..."
Media:vo bdcop001 1905106 beidou 02.ogg Beidou: ...Zhong? Hmm, I barely remember this name.
 Maybe you've been gone too long.
 It's probably because you were little at the time.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905106 beidou 03.ogg Beidou: You're right. I was only about five or six years old when I first arrived here.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905106 beidou 04.ogg Beidou: I was homeless and had to wander around the streets. I remember finally managing to find half a Rice Bun, but then a stray dog jumped out and snatched it away from me.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905106 beidou 05.ogg Beidou: Half a Rice Bun was not something I was willing to give up so easily at the time, so I chased it all the way to this neighborhood.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905106 beidou 06.ogg Beidou: Then a few fishermen saw us running and stopped me. They were kind enough to give me some food.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905106 beidou 07.ogg Beidou: Seeing me stop, the dog also stopped running.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905106 beidou 08.ogg Beidou: But straight away, it keeled over and never got up again. Maybe it was too tired or maybe it had starved to death.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905106 beidou 09.ogg Beidou: I went over and saw that the dog still had the half Rice Bun in its mouth. It didn't let go even at the very end... Heh, poor thing.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905108 beidou 01.ogg Beidou: Had I known the dog was so weak, I would have let it take that half Rice Bun.
 That's when the villagers here took you in?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905106 beidou 10.ogg Beidou: I could tell they were wary of me at first. I was the dirty little kid who had just chased a dog to death over some scraps of food.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905106 beidou 11.ogg Beidou: But I got lucky. The village chief took pity on me and brought me to their home. That's how I ended up staying here.
 What made you leave later?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905106 beidou 12.ogg Beidou: Hehe...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905106 beidou 13.ogg Beidou: Do you know what the name "Beidou" means?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905107 beidou 01.ogg Beidou: Come on, I'll explain along the way.
(Go with Beidou to the fishing village for a walk)
Media:vo bdcop001 1905107 beidou 02.ogg Beidou: About a year or two after I arrived, the village chief fell ill during the winter and passed away.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905107 beidou 03.ogg Beidou: During that same period, the harvest was getting worse and the fishermen's catch was getting smaller day by day.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905107 beidou 04.ogg Beidou: Without the village chief to handle the situation, people began blaming each other. There were even rumors that some families had been overfishing, leaving nothing for the rest of the village to catch.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905107 beidou 05.ogg Beidou: But in the end, they all turned on me, saying that they shouldn't have ever taken me in. They said I was bad luck.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905107 beidou 06.ogg Beidou: They pointed to how that dog died on the first day I arrived.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905107 beidou 07.ogg Beidou: Next thing you know, the village chief dies, then all the fish die out.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905107 beidou 08.ogg Beidou: They said I was a living curse, and the downfall of the village was all my fault.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905107 beidou 09.ogg Beidou: I told them that I didn't understand. I'm not a curse, I'm just Beidou.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905107 beidou 10.ogg Beidou: Then some of the villagers started shouting and drove me out of the village.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905107 beidou 11.ogg Beidou: They shouted, "Nandou controls life! Beidou controls death... Beidou controls death!"
Media:vo bdcop001 1905107 beidou 12.ogg Beidou: Before then, all I knew about my name was that it had something to do with the stars.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905107 beidou 13.ogg Beidou: It wasn't until then that I realized that Beidou was a constellation, and the Alcor, one of its stars, was an omen of death.

A Smattering of Memories[]

(Talk to Beidou)
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 02.ogg Beidou: Here we are. This is the old house of the village chief.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 03.ogg Beidou: I bet he never expected that the little girl he took in would grow up to be seen as a curse that brought about the village's total destruction.
 If you're cursed, then I think I am too.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 04.ogg Beidou: What do you mean?
 The Anemo Archon's Gnosis was taken after I arrived in Mondstadt.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 05.ogg Beidou: Haha, is that all?
 The Geo Archon's Gnosis was also taken after I arrived in Liyue.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 06.ogg Beidou: And then lemme guess — you got to Inazuma and the Electro Archon's Gnosis was taken as well?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 07.ogg Beidou: Heh, well you seem to wreak havoc on a grander scale than I ever could.
 Does that make you feel better now?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 08.ogg Beidou: Hahahaha. I get it, you're trying to convince me that I'm not cursed.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 09.ogg Beidou: I appreciate it, and I'll take it.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 10.ogg Beidou: Let's not forget that the people whose names stick around are the ones who emerge from the stormy seas unscathed, and the ones who get swept away in the wind are the fledgling birds who couldn't hack it.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 11.ogg Beidou: I for one have never encountered a storm I couldn't weather.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 12.ogg Beidou: But your journey's far from over, isn't it? Just remember, there's no telling what else you might encounter in this vast world.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 13.ogg Beidou: So if you ever find some idiot trying to brand you as a scapegoat just because you're the one who lived to tell the tale, tell them Captain Beidou demands to have the honor along with you.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 14.ogg Beidou: Remember, you'll always have the captain of The Crux to back you up wherever you go.
 I suppose we're just two scapegoats looking out for each other.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 15.ogg Beidou: Hahaha! Two cursed scapegoats banding together for survival... sounds like a recipe for disaster, but at the same time...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 16.ogg Beidou: I kinda dig it.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 17.ogg Beidou: I'm lucky to have a friend like you!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 18.ogg Beidou: Okay, it's time to get back to our photography. Right, teacher?
 You finally remembered what we're here for.
 I thought you might not be in the mood.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 19.ogg Beidou: C'mon, let's not waste any time... Get it done while you can, before I change my mind.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 20.ogg Beidou: So, do I need to strike a pose?
 Maybe go for something a little... flirtatious?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 22.ogg Beidou: Wh—What!? The nerve! What do you think this is!?
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 23.ogg Beidou: I don't want to do this whole modeling thing!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 24.ogg Beidou: Hey, cut it out! No more pictures!
You quickly press on the shutter before Beidou is fully prepared, and a very charming photo comes out of the Kamera.

"I thought we agreed to strike a flirtatious pose..." "Sorry, you agreed with who again!?"


 Perhaps you can strike an epic pose.
 However you prefer.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905103 beidou 21.ogg Beidou: Alright, how about this?

Snap![]

(Talk to Beidou again before taking the picture)
Media:vo bdcop001 1905109 beidou 01.ogg Beidou: How about this pose?
(Take a picture of Beidou)
Media:vo bdcop001 1905104 beidou 02.ogg Beidou: So, is it done yet? Please don't tell me that it looks weird...
 Not at all, it's perfect.
 You were born to be a model.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905104 beidou 03.ogg Beidou: Show me.
 Only if you promise to give it back.
 Only if you promise not to beat me up if you don't like it...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905104 beidou 04.ogg Beidou: Sure, whatever. Now give it here!
You hand her the photo.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905104 beidou 05.ogg Beidou: Hmm, yes... I see... Alright! On behalf of The Crux, thank you very much for your photography class today. You've been an excellent teacher, and I couldn't be more satisfied.
Media:vo bdcop001 1905104 beidou 06.ogg Beidou: Now, as Captain of The Crux, I am exercising my official right...
Media:vo bdcop001 1905104 beidou 07.ogg Beidou: ...to requisition this photograph for future promotion and recruitment purposes!
Media:vo bdcop001 1905104 beidou 08.ogg Beidou: So I'm afraid I'll be holding on to this. That's fine with you, though, right? Haha...

 Quest DescriptionAfter weighing the pros and cons, you decide to seek out Wisdom Seelie's true identity.
(Gather more information about the Wisdom Seelie)
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Katayoun, optional)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 katayoun 11.ogg Katayoun: (*sigh* Did someone put the books back in the wrong place again?)
(Talk to Katayoun)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 katayoun 01.ogg Katayoun: Oh, hello there. Can I help you?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 layla 01.ogg Layla: Uh, hello, I'm a Rtawahist student and would like to see the checkout logs for "Theoretical Astrology" and "A Quick Reference Guide to Astrology Cases."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 katayoun 02.ogg Katayoun: Oh, are you also here to investigate the Rtawahist Wisdom Seelie legend?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 layla 02.ogg Layla: "Also?" Hmm... I suppose it makes sense that we're not the only ones investigating such a popular legend.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 katayoun 03.ogg Katayoun: Yes, I myself am also quite curious about it. But unfortunately, I haven't found anything out of the ordinary.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 katayoun 04.ogg Katayoun: Given you're a Rtawahist student, I'm sure you know that a lot of research references these two books. All our copies of these particular titles are frequently checked out.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 katayoun 05.ogg Katayoun: I have looked into it, but found no irregularities in the checkout logs.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 layla 03.ogg Layla: Is there any chance the Seelie could have taken the books out and returned them without being noticed...?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 katayoun 06.ogg Katayoun: Not likely, that would be almost impossible. The House of Daena is extremely strict about the circulation of its books. There will always be a record if a book is checked out.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 katayoun 07.ogg Katayoun: And even if it managed to figure out a way to take the books without leaving any record, it's possible that someone would come looking to borrow the books before the Seelie returned them.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 katayoun 08.ogg Katayoun: If someone discovers that a book is missing or that it doesn't match my inventory records, it would come to my attention immediately.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 katayoun 09.ogg Katayoun: However, it might be possible to pull off in the case of a less popular book...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 layla 04.ogg Layla: Okay. I understand now, thank you.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 layla 05.ogg Layla: This is useful to know. With any luck, it'll help us work out the Seelie's identity.
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Katayoun, optional)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 katayoun 12.ogg Katayoun: (Speaking of checkouts, it's time to do a routine inventory check. I hope everything's in order.)
(Talk to Katayoun again)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915201 katayoun 10.ogg Katayoun: I assure you that you won't find anything strange here.
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Hunayn, optional)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 15.ogg Hunayn: (The House of Daena doesn't feel as quiet as it used to be.)
(Talk to Hunayn)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 layla 01.ogg Layla: Hi there, have you heard of the legend of the Wisdom Seelie?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 01.ogg Hunayn: Do I really look like the kind of student that would be interested in such a pointless legend...?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 layla 02.ogg Layla: Oh uh, I'm sorry, we were just curious.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 02.ogg Hunayn: Well, I do happen to have some information on it.
 Then why didn't you just say so?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 03.ogg Hunayn: Huh? Logically, that has nothing to do with the question I asked.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 04.ogg Hunayn: I just don't want others to see me as some poor excuse for a student, whiling away my time in the House of Daena.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 layla 03.ogg Layla: I don't really think bad students would come to the House of Daena to pass the time... But anyways, you were saying?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 05.ogg Hunayn: Well, I spend most of my time here, and I have noticed something odd before.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 06.ogg Hunayn: One time, late at night, a black shadow fell from above and landed in the central area of the House of Daena.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 07.ogg Hunayn: Of course, I was a little sleepy at the time, but it startled me and I got up to see what was going on.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 layla 04.ogg Layla: An—And then what happened??
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 08.ogg Hunayn: Then, the shadow quickly circled behind me with incredible speed. Just as I tried to turn around to get a look at it, I fainted.
 This shadow sounds pretty powerful.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 09.ogg Hunayn: Yes, it was unbelievably fast. I had never seen anything like it. It was so unusual that I wasn't sure if it was real or if I was half-dreaming.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 10.ogg Hunayn: But given how popular the legend of the Seelie has become lately, maybe this has something to do with it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 layla 05.ogg Layla: Don't take this the wrong way, but... doesn't the House of Daena have a door?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 11.ogg Hunayn: It was closed that night. I suppose even the House of Daena needs to be closed for maintenance from time to time.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 layla 06.ogg Layla: I see, that makes sense...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 layla 07.ogg Layla: But what were you doing here if the House of Daena was closed?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 12.ogg Hunayn: Don't look so surprised. It's a common practice to find a place to hide before they lock the doors so you can continue reading books here... Everyone knows that.
 Good thing I'm not studying alongside you. I can tell that you'd really stress me out.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 layla 08.ogg Layla: Anyway, thank you for the info. I'll be sure to take note of everything you mentioned.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 13.ogg Hunayn: You're welcome.
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Hunayn, optional)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 16.ogg Hunayn: (No wonder the House of Daena has been getting more noisy recently...)
(Talk to Hunayn again)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915202 hunayn 14.ogg Hunayn: If you don't have any more questions, I'm gonna go back to my books now.
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Latifah, optional)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 15.ogg Latifah: (I wonder if there will be any new sightings today...)
(Talk to Latifah)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 layla 01.ogg Layla: Hi there, do you know anything about the Wisdom Seelie?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 01.ogg Latifah: Yes, of course. I've been looking into it for quite a while now.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 02.ogg Latifah: However, I feel like I'm still missing some key pieces of information. Hey, maybe if we put our heads together, we can figure something out.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 layla 02.ogg Layla: Sure, I'll try my best.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 03.ogg Latifah: There are a few known traits of the Wisdom Seelie. First, it's extremely strong. It can easily carry a few dozen books, along with four or five pieces of astrology equipment all at once.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 04.ogg Latifah: It's extremely athletic as well. It only moves in a straight line and doesn't stop for anything, not even walls or rivers.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 05.ogg Latifah: Lastly, it has a number of "special abilities." It has a hardened metal body that's impervious to injury, it can freeze water into ice, and it can also summon meteors.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 layla 03.ogg Layla: That... doesn't even sound human.
 It sounds like some hero out of a fairy tale.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 06.ogg Latifah: Well, it is a legend after all. It's no surprise that some details seem a little exaggerated.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 07.ogg Latifah: But these aren't just made up, you know. Each of its abilities has been confirmed by eyewitnesses.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 08.ogg Latifah: There have been many sightings too, including at Chatrakam Cave, the Avidya Forest, and around the waterfall south of Sumeru City.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 layla 04.ogg Layla: Has anyone seen what it actually looks like? Or what kind of a person it is?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 09.ogg Latifah: Hmm, not that I know of. No one's been able to get close to it. It seems like it tries to stay out of sight.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 10.ogg Latifah: I would probably want to remain a mystery too, if I were someone as legendary as the Wisdom Seelie.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 11.ogg Latifah: So, what do you make of it? Have you seen it somewhere as well?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 layla 05.ogg Layla: No... We're probably gonna need some time to digest all the... incredible information you've provided us.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 12.ogg Latifah: Haha, not a problem. But if you manage to find anything, be sure to come and tell me about it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 13.ogg Latifah: I trust that you'll quickly discover the excitement of slowly unraveling the truth.
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Latifah, optional)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 16.ogg Latifah: (It's so exciting to search and dig for the truth.)
(Talk to Latifah again)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915203 latifah 14.ogg Latifah: Please remember to share any new information you come across.
(After Talking to Katayoun, Hunayn, and Latifah)

 Quest DescriptionTo make some Chilibrew, Barbara has asked you to look for some fresh Jueyun Chilis near the Stone Gate.
Barbara's Home-Made Chilibrew[]

(Head near the Stone Gate)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900401 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Over there, Jueyun Chilis! Quick, let's go and pick some.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900401 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: These are fresh alright, Paimon can feel the spiciness just by holding them...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900401 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Let's go to the Whispering Woods and find Barbara.
(Wait for Barbara outside the Whispering Woods)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900401 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: This seems like the right place, but Barbara isn't here...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900401 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Well, let's wait here a while, she'll probably be back soon.
(Continue to A Meeting Mysteriously Missed)

A Meeting Mysteriously Missed[]

The Traveler and Paimon begin to wait
Media:vo bblcop001 1900401 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Ugh, it's been ages, where in Teyvat did she go...?
 I'm a little worried...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900401 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Paimon's worried too, Barbara should have been back by now.
 Let's look for her.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900401 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: She said she wanted to go to the Whispering Woods and pick Sweet Flowers — let's head over there.
(Search for Barbara inside the Whispering Woods)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900404 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: She's not here either... Where the heck is she already? ...Let's look further up ahead.
(Talk to Barbara at the other end of the Whispering Woods)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900405 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wait, that's Barbara! Why is she hiding? Let's see what's going on.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900402 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Wh—? How did you two... Quickly, this way, try not to make a sound.
 We thought something might have happened, so we came looking for you.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900402 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Oh, I'm so sorry, I ran into something unexpected... *sigh* There's no heading back now...
 What are you doing here?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900402 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Long story short... I was picking Sweet Flowers, and suddenly a group of Treasure Hoarders appeared.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900402 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: They'd seized a merchant of some kind and were pushing her around. It sounded like they were demanding money from her...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900402 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: I took cover right away, but I've been trailing them ever since.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900402 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: I guess they were too caught up with the merchant to notice me.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900402 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: I followed them this far, but it seemed like they knew somebody was following them, so I didn't go any further.
 That was risky, what if you'd been discovered?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900402 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: Don't worry about me, they're only Treasure Hoarders after all. Anyways, I've got a Vision, it's enough to protect myself.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900402 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: As for the person they seized... they might be in danger. That's why I was secretly trailing them.
 Best to go back and get the Knights of Favonius involved.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900402 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: I thought of getting the Knights involved, but I was worried it would take too long... What if the Treasure Hoarders did something terrible while I was gone...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900402 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: I was trying to think of some way of rescuing the merchant when you showed up.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900402 barbara 13.ogg Barbara: So... Honorary Knight, maybe you could, uh...
 Say no more, I'm sure these Treasure Hoarders will respond well to a little "direct intervention."
Media:vo bblcop001 1900402 barbara 14.ogg Barbara: Yay! I'll leave it to you, Honorary Knight. I'll handle the aftercare.
 I try to refrain from intervening too directly whenever possible.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900402 barbara 15.ogg Barbara: Oh.. B—But sometimes — I mean — for some people, it's hard to persuade them without, you know... "direct intervention."
Media:vo bblcop001 1900402 barbara 16.ogg Barbara: Please, Honorary Knight, it's up to you. I'll handle the aftercare.
(Continue to Knight and Deaconess, Ready for Battle!)

The Cat's Tail's Specialty[]

(Look for Barbara around The Cat's Tail)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? Look at that crowd of people! And there's Barbara!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What's going on here?

Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Uh... Th—Thank you for all your support... P—Please, one at a time...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 schulz 01.ogg Schulz: Barbara-sama, I never expected I would have a chance to meet you here today! Are you here attending to matters for the Church?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Ah, I—I guess you could say that...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 herman 01.ogg Herman: Barbara-sama, may I get your autograph?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 herman 02.ogg Herman: I— My daughter Ellin is a big fan of yours...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Oh, is that so? Hehe... A—Alright, just one moment...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 susie 01.ogg Susie: Oh gosh... Barbara-sama, I love your style! Please tell me how I can be more like you!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: O—Oh, really? Well, I—I am still learning and growing myself...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: I—I guess all I can say is... Do your best every day!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 schulz 02.ogg Schulz: Oh, Barbara-sama!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 herman 03.ogg Herman: Barbara-sama!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 susie 02.ogg Susie: Barbara-sama...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: Ohh... Oh my...
 (Looks like we might need to intervene...)
 (Barbara needs rescuing from the crowd...)

(Talk to Herman)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900903 herman 01.ogg Herman: Barbara-sama, can I get an autograph? Ellin would be so happy, she's your biggest fan!
 Barbara's currently on leave, please don't disturb her. (−1 Heart)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900903 herman 02.ogg Herman: Uh... If she's on leave then... an autograph won't be a problem. Right?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900903 herman 03.ogg Herman: Barbara-sama, I — ahem, my daughter, eh-he — would love an autograph. Ellin really is your biggest fan!
 (Uh oh...)
(Failed to persuade Herman)
 You won't mind if I check in with Ellin on that? Looks like she's training, right over th—
Media:vo bblcop001 1900903 herman 04.ogg Herman: Ah!? W—Wait! I, uh...
 Barbara is on official business right now.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900903 herman 05.ogg Herman: Oh, is that right! Well then, uh... I'll leave her to it. Ellin looks busy with her training, some other time perhaps...
(Succeeded to persuade Herman)
(Talk to Schulz)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900902 schulz 01.ogg Schulz: Oh, Barbara-sama! You're so hard-working... If I put in as much effort as you, who knows where my apprenticeship would take me!
 Barbara's currently on leave, please don't disturb her. (−1 Heart)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900902 schulz 02.ogg Schulz: Barbara-sama? On leave? Phew... For a moment, I thought I was disturbing her work...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900902 schulz 03.ogg Schulz: Barbara-sama! Can I get an autograph?
 (This is bad...)
(Failed to persuade Schulz)
 Barbara's working right now, please don't disturb her.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900902 schulz 04.ogg Schulz: You... You must be the Honorary Knight! What are you and Barbara-sama doing he—
 We're... on official business.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900902 schulz 05.ogg Schulz: Uh... Of course! Barbara-sama is working after all... Forgive me, I'll leave you in peace.
(Succeeded to persuade Schulz)
(Talk to Susie)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900904 susie 01.ogg Susie: Please, Barbara-sama, teach me your style! How can I be more like you?
 Please don't disturb her, Barbara's currently on leave. (−1 Heart)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900904 susie 02.ogg Susie: Oh — perfect! I've got so much to learn from Barbara-sama. She'd never have the time if she was working...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900904 susie 03.ogg Susie: Please, Barbara-sama, teach me your style! How can I be more like you?
 (Darn...)
(Failed to persuade Susie)
 If it's Barbara's style you're after, you could start by being considerate to others.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900904 susie 04.ogg Susie: Uhh, sure... considerate to others... Huh? Aren't you that Honorary Knight? You and Barbara-sama must be...
 Uh — we're... on official business.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900904 susie 05.ogg Susie: Official business? Oh, I—I thought... Apologies. I—I just got so excited when I saw Barbara-sama...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900904 susie 06.ogg Susie: Yes, you're right... Being considerate to others is the right place to start.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900904 susie 07.ogg Susie: ...Barbara-sama and the Honorary Knight in the same place — this must be incredibly important official business... I—I'll take my leave.
(Succeeded to persuade Susie)
(If you managed to persuade everyone)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Huh? Where did everybody...
 They came to their senses once I'd given them the lowdown.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: The lowdown... You mean, you persuaded them to leave for now...?
 I temporarily persuaded them to beat it.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Whew... I shouldn't be saying this but... thanks for intervening.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: I understand everybody's enthusiasm, but the longer I stay here the more people will gather. It's always been that way.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: I just don't know how to turn them away. In the end, the Knights of Favonius always have to come and restore order.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: *sigh* If only I had your way with words...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: Here, it's the Fantastic Summer-Serendipity Coral Sparkling Tea you wanted. I ordered this one especially for you.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: I hardly ever get a day off. Why don't we... take a stroll outside the city together and finish our drinks?
(Continue to Deaconess's Time Off)
(If you failed to persuade Susie, Schulz or Herman)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: Please, there's no need to rush... One at a time...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: I'm sorry, can you wait a bit longer? I'm still on a break...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 susie 01.ogg Susie: Barbara-sama! There's still so much I want to learn from you!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 herman 01.ogg Herman: It would make me— uh, my daughter so happy, Barbara-sama!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 schulz 01.ogg Schulz: Barbara-sama! Don't forget my autograph!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: Please! Settle down, I—
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 susie 02.ogg Susie: Oh — I think Monroe might want one too...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 schulz 02.ogg Schulz: And Mr. Wagner! ...Wait, he wouldn't want one, would he...? Uh — let me ask him, though...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 herman 02.ogg Herman: Oh! A friend of mine was asking about autographs, Barbara-sama — make that two!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: Ohh my...
 They're gonna keep asking for more and more...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 13.ogg Barbara: So sorry, please... H—Hold on a moment...
Barbara appeases her fans while the Traveler waits, and waits...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 14.ogg Barbara: Whew... Sorry to keep you waiting so long.
 I've waited longer...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 15.ogg Barbara: You look like you're about to fall asleep! I feel terrible. It was me who invited you for a drink, and here I am wasting your time...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 16.ogg Barbara: Here, it's the Fantastic Summer-Serendipity Coral Sparkling Tea you wanted. I ordered this one especially for you.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 17.ogg Barbara: At least Miss Margaret didn't make our drinks in advance. The flavor would've changed completely by now...
 You don't look too good...
 You look exhausted...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 18.ogg Barbara: Hehe, how can I put this... Those relaxing moments of freedom in Wolvendom...? The rush just now kinda ruined that for me.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 19.ogg Barbara: But as long as I can bring everybody a smile...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 20.ogg Barbara: Although, perhaps you can stay with me a while longer? Let's take a stroll outside the city and finish our drinks.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 21.ogg Barbara: We have to seize every bit of free time we get, even if it only lasts a moment.
(Continue to Deaconess's Time Off)
Deaconess's Time Off[]
(While following Barbara)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: It's nice to finally relax for a while — thanks for accompanying me.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Come to think of it, this is the first time we've gone for a walk together.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: When I heard you'd received the title of Honorary Knight, I thought you'd turn out to be more of a solemn character.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: But now that I've met you, I can't quite believe it. I never thought... O—Oh! I hope I'm not offending you!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: What I mean is, for someone as young as you to achieve the title of Honorary Knight... It's amazing!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: Jean... must really believe in you to grant you this title.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: I hope I can be as great as you one day, so I can help everybody around me too.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: But for now... all I can do is sing.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: ...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: Ah! So sorry, always thinking about myself...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: ...We've walked a long way — why don't we take a break up ahead?

Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: It looks so peaceful here, nobody's passing through except us. Let's rest for a while.
 Just now, in the city... why didn't you just tell them you were on leave and walk away?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 13.ogg Barbara: There's more than one answer to that question.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 14.ogg Barbara: A deaconess shouldn't ever be self-interested or let other people down...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 15.ogg Barbara: But at the end of the day, it's like my father said: I just don't know how to turn people away.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 16.ogg Barbara: My father and Sister Victoria always told me, if I wanted to become a proper deaconess, I would have to learn how to turn away others.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 17.ogg Barbara: But I've never been able to... When I see somebody in need, I lend a hand without a second thought.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 18.ogg Barbara: If I see somebody struggling, I want to help them solve the problem. If somebody comes to me with a request, I can't help but do my best.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 19.ogg Barbara: No matter how tiring, I'm happy as long as I can bring a smile to everybody.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 20.ogg Barbara: *sigh* Perhaps... I'm not a proper deaconess after all.
 That sudden crowd back there in the city... you must be exhausted.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 21.ogg Barbara: Hehe, I'm so used to it by now, but thanks for wanting to intervene.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 22.ogg Barbara: Usually, the Knights of Favonius end up arriving to restore order. Then someone from the Church comes to escort me away.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 23.ogg Barbara: It's happened so many times already, I don't really notice it anymore.
 Isn't it a little exhausting?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 24.ogg Barbara: Of course! More than a little, to say the least...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 25.ogg Barbara: But exhaustion for the sake of not letting everybody down is okay.
 What's the Barbara Fan Club?
(This dialogue option is locked behind the specific dialogue choices you made up to now, see the section below on how to unlock this)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 26.ogg Barbara: Heh, that thing? Uhh... It's a group of my Mondstadt... supporters.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 27.ogg Barbara: But I'm usually in the Cathedral. The knights and sisters stationed outside the Church won't let them in.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 28.ogg Barbara: So they support me in other ways — cleaning the Cathedral, helping their fellow citizens with difficult matters, stuff like that.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 29.ogg Barbara: It's... very considerate, though sometimes they get carried away.
 And how many members does the group have?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 30.ogg Barbara: Uh, I'm not really sure... but of the ones I know, there's Mr. Albert and Mr. Huffman.
 Ah yes, the knight...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 31.ogg Barbara: Oh, do you know Mr. Huffman? He's a very strict knight, not to mention disciplined.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 32.ogg Barbara: He's never asked for my autograph or tried to make conversation. Every time he comes to the Cathedral on official business, his face is a picture of seriousness.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 33.ogg Barbara: I'd never have known if I hadn't overheard Mr. Albert talking about it.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 34.ogg Barbara: When I found out, I had someone deliver my autograph to him. I hope he was happy with it.
 I get the feeling you're more popular than the average sister...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 35.ogg Barbara: Yeah, it's a little embarrassing... Do you know what an "idol" is?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 36.ogg Barbara: I guess you've heard that I... sometimes sing for the people in Mondstadt?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 37.ogg Barbara: I can use the power of my Vision to heal physical wounds, but it's no use on someone afflicted by sadness.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 38.ogg Barbara: I found out in a magazine that there was such a thing as an "idol."
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 39.ogg Barbara: In the magazine, it said that an idol was... a person that spreads love and hope through song and dance.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 40.ogg Barbara: I don't know if it's really possible, but... at least the residents of Mondstadt seem to like my singing.
 There was once an idol who stopped a war with their singing.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 41.ogg Barbara: R—Really? That's so impressive...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 42.ogg Barbara: Do you know that idol? They sound like a mighty Vision bearer.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 43.ogg Barbara: Still, using song and dance to heal the sick of heart... It's easier said than done.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 44.ogg Barbara: I don't know if I'm up to it. I'm not even very good at being a deaconess...
 Why, sure you are.
 You're already a very gifted healer.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 45.ogg Barbara: Aw, if that really is true... then that's amazing.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 46.ogg Barbara: ...Thank you. It's been a long time since I've had such a long conversation, and it's all me complaining! Thanks for listening.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 47.ogg Barbara: The support of an Honorary Knight goes a long way!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 48.ogg Barbara: *sigh* So... we've still not finished our drinks! Let's finish them off while we're here.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 49.ogg Barbara: We can rest today, but it's back to the grindstone tomorrow.

Dialogue[]
 Quest DescriptionNingguang has been working pretty hard all day. You'd like to help her take a day off. She seems to have some idea of what she'd like to do during this down-time...

(Wait until the following day (07:00–08:00))
(Wake Ningguang up)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Yes, I'm already awake.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: I'll be out in a moment. I'm just changing.
(Talk to Ningguang)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: Good morning. Did you sleep well?
 The same as usual.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: That's good. I was worried you'd be a little uncomfortable.
 I was a little nervous.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: There's nothing to worry about. We just need to go through the schedule you made and tick the items off one by one.
 I was so excited I couldn't sleep.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: Oh, how strange — me too! ...I'm joking, of course — I slept like a baby. Sorry to disappoint you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: So. What's item one on today's schedule?
 Here. Take a look for yourself.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Hmm...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: I imagine this must have taken Baishi completely by surprise.
 Yes, but she said she'd leave it up to me.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: Sure. There's no harm in changing my schedule around once in a while.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: My schedule is usually very tightly packed, and any extra time I can squeeze out is spent on preparing for the future.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: So it'll be quite nice to take a break.
 You don't take many breaks, huh?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: I don't often feel tired. Seeing the Mora come in has a way of making me feel quite invigorated.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: Still, your idea is very sensible. Mora can only lift a weary spirit. It cannot alleviate physical fatigue.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: So then. The day's ahead of us. Any ideas on how to spend it?
 Let's do something you never normally have time for. (This dialogue option leads to Liyue Millennial.)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 16.ogg Ningguang: Something I never have time for...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 17.ogg Ningguang: Ah, have you played the chess game I made? Or heard of it, perhaps?
 Never heard of it...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 18.ogg Ningguang: It's called Liyue Millennial. Based on classic chess, but with different rules.
 Is it called Liyue Millennial?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 19.ogg Ningguang: Yes. It's based on classic chess, but with different rules.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 20.ogg Ningguang: When I was designing it, I wanted it not only to be a fun game, but also capture Liyue's culture in a unique way.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 21.ogg Ningguang: So I introduced a lot of concepts that aren't part of traditional chess, as well as different chess pieces and even boards.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 22.ogg Ningguang: I'm constantly revising and expanding it. So far, there are over 30 editions.
 What an ambitious project...
 It sounds quite complicated...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 23.ogg Ningguang: True. That's one reason why it's been difficult to catch on.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 24.ogg Ningguang: But I don't feel that making it easier to learn is necessarily a good thing.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 25.ogg Ningguang: Isn't one of the joys of playing chess to continually learn and progress through a complex set of rules?
 So how do we get people interested in it?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 26.ogg Ningguang: I think the key will be to make something that easily catches the attention of people who haven't played much chess before.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 27.ogg Ningguang: I'm planning to make a new set with the board and pieces based on the battle for Liyue.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 28.ogg Ningguang: One side will play the guardians of Liyue Harbor. The other side will play the Fatui and Osial.
 Sounds fun.
 I'd play that.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 29.ogg Ningguang: No problem. I will let you try it out as soon as I finish the prototype.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 30.ogg Ningguang: I want to make each of the chess pieces of Liyue Millennial as true-to-life as possible.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 31.ogg Ningguang: And no Guardians of Liyue chess set would be complete without you, would it?
 You're going to make a chess piece based on me?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 32.ogg Ningguang: I am indeed. Many of them, in fact.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 33.ogg Ningguang: My thinking was that only people who pre-order the chess set at full price will be eligible to receive the limited-edition Traveler chess piece.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 34.ogg Ningguang: It seems only fitting for someone of your status.
 So I'm part of the marketing plan...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 35.ogg Ningguang: Naturally, since you are the face of that historic event. I intend to make chess pieces for everyone who was involved that day, including myself.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 36.ogg Ningguang: Everyone who owns this chess set will preserve this moment in history in a vivid and compelling form.
 It sounds great.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 37.ogg Ningguang: Then it's decided.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 38.ogg Ningguang: Come with me. To make this chess piece, I need to take some measurements.
(Proceed to Liyue Millennial)
 Let's do something you never normally have the opportunity to do. (This dialogue option leads to Starting From Zero or Endless Smoke.)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 39.ogg Ningguang: Something I never have the opportunity to do...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 40.ogg Ningguang: Interesting. Before I decide, I'd like to know... what gave you this idea?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 41.ogg Ningguang: Because as far as most people are concerned, Mora is the key to any and all opportunities.
 But being a member of the Liyue Qixing is a limitation.
 But Mora can also be a limitation.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 44.ogg Ningguang: Yes, you're absolutely right. This is what I appreciate about you, you see things the way they are rather than how they appear.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 45.ogg Ningguang: I want to do something a little self-indulgent. Is that okay by you?
 Sure. Whatever you feel like doing.
 The day is yours. Do with it as you please.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 48.ogg Ningguang: Thank you. Alright here it is — I've always thought it would be fun to recapture what life was like before I joined the Liyue Qixing.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 49.ogg Ningguang: I was born into a humble family, and all the wealth you see now began with a single haul of fish.
 You... know how to fish?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 51.ogg Ningguang: Hehe. I had to. I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 52.ogg Ningguang: Fishing isn't the half of it. You'd be amazed at some of the odd jobs I've worked in my time.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 53.ogg Ningguang: A lot of the old folks like to brag about how I used to be their errand-runner back in the day... hehe.
 It's hard to imagine...
 But it makes sense.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 56.ogg Ningguang: They were tough times. But I had a clear goal and plenty of motivation.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 57.ogg Ningguang: If I didn't make any money in the morning, I'd have no food for lunch. I guess that's why I came to be so obsessed with Mora.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 58.ogg Ningguang: I want to re-live that time from my life, feel some of that drive again. Take a trip down memory lane.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 59.ogg Ningguang: So how about it? Will you join me?
 Sure.
 It's not what I was expecting but it sounds like a lot of fun.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 62.ogg Ningguang: Great. Then let me lay down the ground rules.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 63.ogg Ningguang: We're not to use our status or reputation in Liyue Harbor to our advantage, and we have no starting capital.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 64.ogg Ningguang: The goal is to see how much Mora we can make under these conditions.
 Let's start at the bottom of the ladder. (This dialogue option leads to Starting From Zero.)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 67.ogg Ningguang: Okay, but working as a day laborer could be quite dull...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 68.ogg Ningguang: Why don't we go down to the docks?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 69.ogg Ningguang: They periodically throw out a lot of unclaimed or abandoned goods. We might find something that we can exchange for Mora.
 That's not the most dignified way to make money...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 70.ogg Ningguang: What does it matter? Don't worry about it, it's all part of the fun.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 71.ogg Ningguang: Come on. Let's go down to the docks.
(Proceed to Starting From Zero)
 Let's go and find some work at Northland Bank. (This dialogue option leads to Endless Smoke.)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 72.ogg Ningguang: I can see why you'd suggest that. You're thinking I could use my knowledge of how Mora works to my advantage and make a lot of money there.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 73.ogg Ningguang: But Northland Bank is a special case. I rather suspect I would not be welcome there.
Because you've clashed in the past?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 74.ogg Ningguang: Yes, and also... Never mind, I'll just show you. It won't eat up too much time.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913801 ningguang 75.ogg Ningguang: I expect they still hold a grudge against me to this day.
(Proceed to Endless Smoke)

Media:vo kycop001 1909701 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: You're more punctual than I expected.
Media:vo kycop001 1909701 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Let's head inside.
(Talk to Elzer)
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 01.ogg Elzer: Master Kaeya? And (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! Welcome, welcome. Please come in, I'll fetch you both something to drink.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Long time no see, Elzer.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 02.ogg Elzer: Haha, yes, it's been a while, hasn't it? So, what brings you back to the winery this... *cough* Sorry... Is there anything I can do for you?
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: No need to be so formal. I just returned from Sumeru, and dropped by to see you all.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 03.ogg Elzer: Ah... What a pity, Master Diluc went out to handle business last night, and hasn't returned yet...
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Never mind, the main thing is that you and Adelinde are here. Oh, speaking of Adelinde, where is she?
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 04.ogg Elzer: She's taking some time off. She was busy cleaning yesterday, and finally has a bit of time to herself.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Perfect. I brought some gifts for you both. Here, this belt buckle is for you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 05.ogg Elzer: My goodness, it's exquisite... Thank you, Master Kaeya, I... *cough* I'll treasure it.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 06.ogg Elzer: Would you like anything to drink? We recently finished making a new batch of Dandelion Wine.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Well, what perfect timing. I was just wondering how this year's batch was coming along.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 07.ogg Elzer: Let me fetch a barrel and have someone deliver it to the Knights of Favonius headquarters for you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Oh, I won't be needing an entire barrel. A couple of bottles will be more than sufficient... else Diluc might say I came here to beg.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 08.ogg Elzer: Oh, Master Diluc might grumble, but he doesn't mean it. Anyway, let me fix you both a drink.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 kaeya 07a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1909702 kaeya 07b.ogg Kaeya: Much obliged. Then I'll have a glass of Dandelion Wine, and a glass of Cider Lake for (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍), if you please.
 "Cider Lake"?
 Am I drinking lakewater?
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 09.ogg Elzer: The name is not that literal. It is a drink with virtually no alcoholic content, as Master Kaeya will be aware. I'll prepare them now, please wait a moment.
 Of course, my drink is non-alcoholic...
 Dunno what I was expecting. Never mind, I'm used to it already.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Strictly speaking, that's not entirely true. "Cider Lake" does have a tiny amount of alcohol in it...
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 10.ogg Elzer: Please, enjoy.
 (Try the "Cider Lake" that Elzer mixed)
 It's quite sweet, and very tasty.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 11.ogg Elzer: Pleased you like it. Looks like my bartending skills haven't faded with age.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: How have you been recently? Is the winery's business doing well?
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 12.ogg Elzer: To tell you the truth, we've had our work cut out for us recently trying to fulfill some major orders. Things have only just started to quiet down over the last couple of days.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: So you've had no time off lately?
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 13.ogg Elzer: Haha... *cough* Master Diluc was concerned about the same thing.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 14.ogg Elzer: But with him being out on business for a few days, who would take care of business and the guests if I were to take time off? Maybe some other time.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: At least take half a day to see a doctor and make sure you're okay. If your condition worsens, Diluc will never forgive himself.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 15.ogg Elzer: *cough cough* You make a fair point...
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: If you're worried about having someone to handle the winery, why not leave it to me? I'm familiar enough with your responsibilities to cover for you for a while.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 16.ogg Elzer: Master Kaeya, I...
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 elzer 17.ogg Elzer: *sigh* ...Please come back to the winery more often. We all miss you very much.
Media:vo kycop001 1909702 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: Alright, alright, no need for that kind of talk. Come on, I'll see you out.
(Outside the manor)
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 elzer 01.ogg Elzer: While I'm resting, I shall leave Dawn Winery in your hands.
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. Rest easy. And go see the doctor.
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Such great weather today... A calm breeze and delicious wine, this is quite the treat.
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Though it's a pity this batch seems a bit bland. How about I go to the wine locker and fetch one from the reserve collection? I remember it's on the second floor...
 Huh? Is that allowed?
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Of course it's fine. I promised Elzer I'd help, I said nothing about leaving the wine alone.
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 adelinde 01.ogg Adelinde: Sorry I'm a little late to the welcome party, but I believe I just heard the words "wine locker" and "reserve collection"... Planning on pilfering a bottle of reserve, Master Kaeya?
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 adelinde 02.ogg Adelinde: The reserve collection is reserved for a reason, you know... You should at least run it past Master Diluc first.
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Adelinde, surely you misheard? We were simply taking a walk around the house.
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 adelinde 03.ogg Adelinde: I see. Anyway, what brings you and (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) to the winery today?
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: We just returned from Sumeru. It's been a while, so I thought we might drop by and say hello.
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: And perhaps enjoy a complimentary drink while we're here. Surely you wouldn't object, Adelinde?
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 adelinde 04.ogg Adelinde: How could I object? We're simply happy that you've come back to see us.
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Oh, Adelinde — I also brought some gifts for you all. This bottle of essential oil is for you. If you rub it on your hands when it gets cold, your skin won't crack.
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 adelinde 05.ogg Adelinde: Oh my, I can't believe you remembered something like that...
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Of course I remember. You always took such good care of me when I fell sick as a child. In comparison, this is nothing.
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 adelinde 06.ogg Adelinde: ...You're all grown up now, and you don't get sick nearly as easily. You don't need me to look after you anymore.
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: True, I don't get sick as much, but speaking of being looked after... When I was in Sumeru, I did find myself and my stomach missing your cooking so terribly...
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 adelinde 07.ogg Adelinde: Oh, are you hungry? Would you like to eat something? You too, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), please tell me if there's anything you'd like to eat.
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Well, now that you mention it... I do actually feel a bit peckish.
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 adelinde 08.ogg Adelinde: Steak?
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Ooh, yes. A nice steak would really hit the spot.
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 adelinde 09.ogg Adelinde: Fragrant Cedar Wood grilled, medium, stewed vegetables on the side?
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: Yes, just like you always used to make. Thank you kindly, Adelinde.
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 adelinde 10.ogg Adelinde: My pleasure. (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), I'm sorry I'm not familiar with your preferences. Would you like to come with me and select a few dishes?
(Talk to Kaeya again, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909703 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: The taste of home... truly irreplaceable.
Guests[]
(Talk to Adelinde)
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 01.ogg Adelinde: Grilling the steak over Fragrant Cedar Wood infuses it with more flavor than pan-frying it. It's a favorite of Master Kaeya's.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 02.ogg Adelinde: Since using an open flame to grill indoors is somewhat inconvenient, we usually set up a grill outdoors. It's perfect for grilling meat, but you can also use it to make stews.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 03.ogg Adelinde: I can offer you a Satisfying Salad, Cold Cut Platter, and anything stewed. What would you prefer, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 Satisfying Salad.
 Cold Cut Platter.
 Sticky Honey Roast.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 04.ogg Adelinde: Okay, right away.
Adelinde easily gets a fire roaring and prepares to boil the vegetables...
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 05.ogg Adelinde: Master Kaeya really likes stewed vegetables, but it takes the most time. So I'll start making that first, and then prepare your meal once that's underway.
 You seem to know Kaeya's preferences inside-out.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 06.ogg Adelinde: Of course. I looked after him and Master Diluc when they were growing up.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 07.ogg Adelinde: He wasn't always such a complicated character... He was a gentle child. Polite and very sweet.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 08.ogg Adelinde: Boys, huh? The gentle ones grow up to be wild, and the rambunctious ones become quiet and reserved.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 09.ogg Adelinde: At least, that's my experience. If there's anything you don't understand about Master Kaeya and his antics, please feel free to talk to me about it.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 10.ogg Adelinde: His temperament has changed quite a lot over the years, but he still has a lot of the endearing qualities I remember.
 I can't always tell if he's being truthful.
 I can't always tell what he's up to.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 11.ogg Adelinde: Kaeya is much savvier and more mature than he used to be. Goodness knows he can be tricky to deal with... But let me share a few little tips.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 12.ogg Adelinde: When he answers your question with a question, stop and think carefully about what he wants you to believe, and don't be led on by him.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 13.ogg Adelinde: As for not knowing what he's up to, hehe, that's because he loves making up a good cover story.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 14.ogg Adelinde: But don't let him get to you too much. You can take it from me... You were drinking a "Cider Lake" just now, right?
 That's right.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 15.ogg Adelinde: Do you know why it's called that? The name was coined by none other than Master Crepus when he mixed the drink for Master Kaeya himself.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 16.ogg Adelinde: They were adorable when they were young. One time, the winery was hosting a banquet, and Master Crepus strictly forbade Master Diluc from drinking.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 17.ogg Adelinde: Master Diluc wasn't happy about that, and he convinced Master Kaeya to team up with him and sneak into the wine cellar to steal some Dandelion Wine.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 18.ogg Adelinde: And how did I find this out? Because when Master Kaeya attempted to distract me, I could clearly see Diluc hiding around the corner of the corridor, gesturing to Master Kaeya to direct him through the whole thing.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 19.ogg Adelinde: The Captain Kaeya of today never bats an eye when he lies, but he wasn't like that at all when he was young... Ah, goodness, how did I get into this...
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 20.ogg Adelinde: Anyway, they were discovered by Master Crepus in the end, and he was furious. He punished Master Kaeya by making him write lines, and Master Diluc was forced to clean the wine barrels in the cellar.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 21.ogg Adelinde: The wine cellar had over a dozen large wine barrels to scrub, and Master Diluc was just a child. There was no way he could finish it all by himself. Master Crepus really meant to teach him a lesson!
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 22.ogg Adelinde: I'd originally planned to secretly finish off the work for him, but when I peeked inside the cellar, I found that Master Kaeya was already there.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 23.ogg Adelinde: He and I finished scrubbing the remaining barrels. When Master Crepus saw that the bruises on Master Kaeya's hands were even darker than those on Master Diluc's hands, he instantly understood the situation.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 24.ogg Adelinde: Master Crepus wasn't stern by nature, so to comfort Master Kaeya, he mixed him a drink and added a few drops of alcohol just so he could have a little taste.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 25.ogg Adelinde: So, you see? Kaeya was a gentle child, and never one to boast about the things he did for other people. Sometimes, he'd even deny it if asked.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 26.ogg Adelinde: His friends have a special place in his heart, even if he keeps this to himself.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 27.ogg Adelinde: Kaeya's quite a smooth talker these days... But I can tell that his habit of quietly helping others hasn't changed.
 I understand what you mean.
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 28.ogg Adelinde: Ah, good. Okay, the stew is nearly ready, but the meat and other dishes will need a moment. Please wait at the table, I'll be over shortly.
(Talk to Adelinde again, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909705 adelinde 29.ogg Adelinde: You're not worried that I can't handle it by myself, are you? Relax. Serving meals is all part of my job as a maid, I can manage.
(Talk to Kaeya)
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Drinking fine wine, eating Adelinde's Steak... Ah, now this is what I call a vacation.
 And I got to hear some stories about your childhood.
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Oh? What has Adelinde been telling you?
 She said you were a very smart kid.
 She said you had a strong sense of justice.
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Haha, so she told you the good stories... Well, shucks, now I'm embarrassed.
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 adelinde 01.ogg Adelinde: Food's ready. I hope you're hungry — I made a little extra, given how long it's been since you were last here.
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: We never imagined there would be such a magnificent feast! You've really outdone yourself. Why don't you sit and eat with us this time?
 Yeah. Let's eat together.
 The more the merrier!
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 adelinde 02.ogg Adelinde: Hehe, if you keep chatting away, the food will get cold. I'll wait here, please call me if you need anything.
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: I'm afraid that just won't do, Adelinde. I'm serious, we get together so rarely, can't you bend the house rules just this once?
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: After all, I don't live here anymore, so I'm just a regular guest. You aren't going to refuse your honored guest this small request, are you?
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 adelinde 03.ogg Adelinde: Since it's you, Master Kaeya, I see no choice but to honor your request.
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 adelinde 04.ogg Adelinde: I know that us sharing a meal is a sign of our close relationship, but this is technically against the rules for a maid... So please forgive me for rebuffing you at first. I didn't mean to sound rude.
 It's all Kaeya's fault.
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 adelinde 05.ogg Adelinde: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), given how petty Master Kaeya can be, it must be hard for him to make friends. Does he have any friends in the Knights of Favonius?
 Yes, me.
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Haha, looks like my efforts have paid off! See, Adelinde?
 Yes, everyone is Kaeya's friend.
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 kaeya 08a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1909706 kaeya 08b.ogg Kaeya: See? I do have a way with people. And now I have (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) here to back me up.
You enjoy a home-cooked meal with Kaeya and Adelinde under a gentle breeze.
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 guangzhi 01.ogg ???: Hello, everyone. Pardon me, but is this Dawn Winery?
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 guangzhi 02.ogg Guangzhi: I am Guangzhi, a guard with the Secure Transport Agency under the Liyue Communications Office. Here is my card.
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: No wonder Elzer felt so strongly about staying, he certainly wasn't kidding about how busy it is... Mr. Guangzhi, a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 guangzhi 03.ogg Guangzhi: The pleasure is all mine. The Secure Transport Agency has worked with your fine establishment in the past, though we have only corresponded through letters. I always found it a great pity that I, the overseer of our cooperation, have never had the occasion to visit in person.
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: Why don't we go inside to discuss the details? No doubt the conversation will flow better with some of our wines to taste. Adelinde, we'll continue our discussion later. Could you fetch some Apple Cider for the three of us?
Media:vo kycop001 1909706 adelinde 06.ogg Adelinde: Certainly, Master Kaeya. Please wait a moment.
(Inside the manor)
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 guangzhi 01.ogg Guangzhi: And how might I address you, Sir, as well as your...
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Just "Kaeya" is fine. I'm standing in today for Elzer, who usually manages the winery's business, and this is my good friend.
 Hi, I'm (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 guangzhi 02.ogg Guangzhi: A pleasure to meet you as well. I am not just here today to pay a visit, I actually have an invitation for Master Diluc to cut the ribbon at a ceremony to celebrate our agency's business.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 guangzhi 03.ogg Guangzhi: Our collaboration with Dawn Winery last year was quite successful, and I was curious about your product shipment plans for the next quarter.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 guangzhi 04.ogg Guangzhi: If it's no trouble, please also mention to Master Diluc that our agency has expanded this year, so if the winery has any additional needs, please consider us.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 adelinde 01.ogg Adelinde: Master Kaeya, the Apple Cider you requested.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 guangzhi 05.ogg Guangzhi: ...Master... wait... Pardon my foolishness, but might I inquire as to your relation to Dawn Winery...?
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: I am Master Crepus's adopted son, and Master Diluc's brother. However, as a serving Captain with the Knights of Favonius, I am rarely at the winery.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 guangzhi 06.ogg Guangzhi: ...My mistake, I apologize for not realizing earlier. I do hope I have not done you a discourtesy.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: You may have misunderstood, Mr. Guangzhi. Though I am Master Diluc's brother, I don't actually live at Dawn Winery.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: I am also a guest here today. I'm merely here receiving guests due to Elzer being temporarily indisposed.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: But please don't worry, I will be sure to extend your invitation to Master Diluc.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 guangzhi 07.ogg Guangzhi: ...Thank you for your graciousness. I knew that Dawn Winery's wines were delicious, but I am only now discovering how wonderful the Apple Cider is. It has a clear and inviting fragrance.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: In addition to the Apple Cider, the winery has an extensive collection of reserve wines and liquors. I see you are also a connoisseur of fine wines, so it would be a shame not to sample some.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Adelinde, please fetch a bottle from the reserve collection in the second floor wine locker.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 adelinde 02.ogg Adelinde: ...As you wish, Master.
The three of you enjoy Apple Cider and an exquisite bottle of reserve.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 guangzhi 08.ogg Guangzhi: Thank you again for your most gracious hospitality, today's trip was very fruitful. Now, allow your humble servant to take his leave.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Please, it was a pleasure. Here's hoping we'll have a chance to share some more fine wines together in the future.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 adelinde 03.ogg Adelinde: The guest has left, Master Kaeya...
 In the end, you couldn't protect the reserve.
 Kaeya's plan succeeded again...
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 adelinde 04.ogg Adelinde: It's no skin off my nose. Master Diluc may have a few choice words when he learns of the situation, but that's all.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 adelinde 05.ogg Adelinde: All I really wanted to say is... You will always be a part of the Dawn Winery family, Master Kaeya.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 adelinde 06.ogg Adelinde: I have never considered you an outsider. No matter when, if you ever feel tired, you'll always be welcome here...
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: I understand, Adelinde.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: Now this is a busy day... Who's at the door this time?
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 elzer 01.ogg Elzer: Hello, everyone. I'm back.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Now that was fast, how are you feeling?
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 elzer 02.ogg Elzer: The doctor said there was nothing to worry about, I just need some rest. But on the way back, I met someone who was looking for Master Kaeya...
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 klee 01.ogg Klee: Kaeya! Shhh...! Klee's here to rescue you, c'mon, let's escape!
 Kaeya's not in danger.
 What are you rescuing Kaeya from...?
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 klee 02a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1909707 klee 02b.ogg Klee: Ah! (‍Mr.Mr.Text for male Traveler/MissMissText for female Traveler‍) Honorary Knight!? Are you grounded with Kaeya, too?
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Grounded? Ah yes, Albedo was saying something about that...
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: Mmm... Sumeru was fun, but it can't compare with Mondstadt. So, here we are.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 klee 03.ogg Klee: You two must have done something to make Jean mad! But that's okay!
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 klee 04.ogg Klee: Kaeya has rescued Klee loads of times before, so when Albedo told me you came back, I went and said sorry to Jean.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 klee 05.ogg Klee: Kaeya, you're free now! We can go play together again!
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 adelinde 07.ogg Adelinde: Ah, if my memory serves me correctly, this child is...
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: This is a fully qualified Knight of Favonius, Klee.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 klee 06.ogg Klee: Hello, Miss! I'm Klee! We're sorry, please don't ground Kaeya!
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 adelinde 08.ogg Adelinde: ...What?
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 klee 07a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1909707 klee 07b.ogg Klee: I really need to take Kaeya and (‍Mr.Mr.Text for male Traveler/MissMissText for female Traveler‍) Honorary Knight away, so we can go find Albedo, Sucrose, Amber, and everyone else and play together!
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 adelinde 09.ogg Adelinde: ...I see. Hello, Miss Klee. You needn't worry, Master Kaeya's grounding is long over.
Media:vo kycop001 1909707 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: See, Adelinde? You don't need to worry about me. I have lots of people to care for me now.

(Talk to Bennett)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904402 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: It feels pretty ordinary here... I was expecting some kind of sense of impending doom.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904402 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Could it be that because you're here with me, I'm feeling more at ease? Hehe...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904402 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: Ahh, it looks like... the door in the front is closed and only the door behind us is open...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904402 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: That mechanism must be for opening the next door, right?
 I think so.
 Well, that's pretty much our only option.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904402 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: Right. Well, we're on the same page at least.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904402 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: I'll go try to operate it.
(Bennett activates the mechanism which opens the doors while closing the doors behind them)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904403 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Just as I expected, hehe.
 But now the door behind us is closed...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904403 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Ah, so it is...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904403 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: Hmm... a true adventurer can't just barge on forward. It's also important to make sure there is a way back. That's what my dads always say.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904403 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: Lemme try the mechanism one more time...
Mechanical Device: *clicking sounds*
Media:vo bntcop001 1904403 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: Hmm, it seems to be... jammed.
 Not what I expected, but not exactly unexpected.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904403 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: This is not good... It seems that we can't get back the way we came.
 Does that mean... we're locked in here?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904403 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: I think so, at least, it seems that way for now...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904403 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: But, don't let it get you down!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904403 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: This kind of thing happens all the time. We just have to believe that there's always a way out.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904403 royce 01.ogg ???: What the... What's going on...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904403 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: Hey, did you hear that?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904403 bennett 11.ogg Bennett: Sounded like it came from the door up ahead of us... Could there be other people in the ruin, too?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904403 bennett 12.ogg Bennett: Let's go check it out!
(Interact with the Mechanical Device)
Mechanical Device: This mechanism makes clacking, whirring noises. It appears to be stuck.

(Follow Bennett into the next room)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904407 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Over there, another adventurer by the looks of it.
(Talk to Bennett after following him to the other adventurer)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Hello, fellow adventurer! We, like you, are here to—
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 01.ogg Royce: ...BENNETT!?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Ah— Royce...!? It's you!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 02.ogg Royce: Oh no, oh please, oh no, no, no...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: I'm so happy to see you again! How are you doing? I've been thinking about you and the other guild members a lot recently...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 03.ogg Royce: This is the worst! Ugh... Why did I have to run into you...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: Oh...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 04.ogg Royce: It took me forever to get this door open! Finally, I was about to advance further in, and all of a sudden... it closes again.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: Ah, I guess that's because I activated the mechanism just now...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 05.ogg Royce: I knew it, I knew it! Of course it was you, I knew it as soon as I saw you.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 06.ogg Royce: As long as you are around, no adventure can ever be a smooth ride! Ugh... This is turning into a very bad day...
 That's a bit harsh, isn't it?
 How can you blame it all on someone else?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 07.ogg Royce: Who are you? And what the heck were you thinking, teaming up with Bennett!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: Hey! Don't fight, don't fight...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), let me introduce Royce, a former member of Benny's Adventure Team, and... and old friend of mine.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 08.ogg Royce: Friend!? I didn't even tell you I was leaving the team, and you still think of me as... your friend...?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 09.ogg Royce: Ugh, never mind, I'm a little on edge because of what just happened. I'm sorry.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: Well, it was my fault... haha...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 10.ogg Royce: Ya think? *sigh* I left because at that time, I really couldn't stand it a second longer. My adventures always used to go off without a hitch...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 11.ogg Royce: But after joining your adventure team, I was tripping and falling one day, getting struck by lightning the next— Oh, and the number of times ruins would cave in on us...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 12.ogg Royce: I just couldn't dismiss it as "mere coincidence" anymore...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 13.ogg Royce: The last straw was when my left leg got hit by that random explosion that came out of nowhere. After that, I couldn't stand it anymore... both literally and figuratively. *sigh* So I left... and went back to being an independent adventurer...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 14.ogg Royce: Only afterward did I start hearing the horror stories about Benny's Adventure Team... *sigh*
 Bennett didn't volunteer for this bad luck.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 15.ogg Royce: ...You're right, I really shouldn't have put the blame on him like that.
 So that's why you left him?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 16.ogg Royce: I didn't think about it much at the time, I was just focused on my own survival, but... there was no other way...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: Alright, alright, it's all in the past now. Talking about all the bad things that happened will only make you more upset, right?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: Um... Royce... I still want to say sorry for all the trouble I caused you.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 17.ogg Royce: Oh... no need to apologize to me. I have made my fair share of mistakes, too...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 11.ogg Bennett: Oh! Yeah... there's one more thing I need to tell you. The door we came through on the way in also got closed, and... I don't think we can get it open again.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 12.ogg Bennett: So we're probably trapped here now. What a pain in the butt, haha...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 18.ogg Royce: ...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 19.ogg Royce: BENNETT!!!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 20.ogg Royce: Ugh! Everything always goes wrong when I'm with you!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 13.ogg Bennett: Oh... well... there's nothing I can do... sorry.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 21.ogg Royce: Ugh, what am I gonna do!? I've used up all of my supplies already!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 22.ogg Royce: This is it... This is how I go, isn't it...? Here, today, and all because of Bennett... *whimpers*
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 14.ogg Bennett: Well... I don't know what I could do to apologize. If you don't mind, maybe we can share some of our supplies with you.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 15.ogg Bennett: Ah, but of course, I'll have to check with my partner first. So, what do you think?
 You cooked it, you can do whatever you want with it. (This dialogue option leads to Ending: Taste Tester Royce.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 23.ogg Royce: Ugh... alright... I am quite hungry. I supposed I shall accept your kind offer.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 24.ogg Royce: ...Is this the "supplies" you were talking about? Why do i have the feeling that this dish is... a bit suspect?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 16.ogg Bennett: It's fine, honestly! It's been with my partner all along, so it shouldn't be tainted with my bad luck...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 25.ogg Royce: If that's true then... okay. Anyway, this is not a time to nitpick.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 26.ogg Royce: Then... I guess I'll just have... little bite..

Royce wolfs down his Ominous Dish...

Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 27.ogg Royce: Hmm, tastes a little... Huh, what a strange texture... Ugh, what is that churning feeling in my stomach...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 28.ogg Royce: ...B—Bennett...
(Royce falls to the ground)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 17.ogg Bennett: Hey, what's wrong? Royce!

Should you say that it was... fortunate that Royce ate that first?

 No way. You don't owe him anything. (This dialogue option leads to Ending: Ready to Make Sacrifices.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 18.ogg Bennett: But it was because of my bad luck, though...
 This is why you should focus on yourself more.
 Stop trying to accommodate others all the time.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 19.ogg Bennett: So you mean... as the unlucky one, I should think of myself more...
 Bennett, you did nothing wrong.
 If you only think about caring for others, who will take care of you?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 20.ogg Bennett: Heh... you do have a point there...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 21.ogg Bennett: It's just, I've been used to thinking this way for a long time. Hearing you say that, though, I feel like maybe I do need to take better care of myself.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 22.ogg Bennett: Uh... I'm sorry Royce, we'll have to keep the rest of our supplies for ourselves. But, let's try to find a way out together.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 29.ogg Royce: Hmph, nobody cares about your supplies. Knowing you, they're probably cursed anyway!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 30.ogg Royce: As for finding the exit together — count me out!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 31.ogg Royce: With Bennett around, I'm sure any exit I find will only be blocked!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 bennett 23.ogg Bennett: Well... then take care, Royce.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 32.ogg Royce: You—
Media:vo bntcop001 1904404 royce 33.ogg Royce: *sigh* ...You take care too Bennett.



(Interact with the Door)
Door: The door is shut tightly... There seems to be no way to open it.

(After activating each mechanism)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904410 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Ah, that was so dangerous!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904410 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: I can't believe it, it's a trap...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904410 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: Hmm... Uh... Nope, no luck here.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904410 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: Aww... What awful luck.

(After activating all mechanisms)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904410 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: I've checked every single nook and cranny in this place...

Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Aww... Still not a clue.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Is there really no way out of here apart from that broken mechanism?
 I'm afraid so...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: Well, guess our only hope now is to wait for help.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: The Adventurers' Guild might notice our disappearance and send someone.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: Then again, that depends on how lucky we are... If the rescue team takes too long to find us, we might already be...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: Ugh, I hate feeling helpless, sitting here waiting for the end to come...
 ...You really have zero expectations when it comes to luck.
 What if help does arrive in time?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: Hmm... Yeah, I am being a bit too pessimistic. No, come on, this isn't like me.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: Okay, let's double-check our supplies. Our priority right now is figuring out how long we can hold out.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: Take out the dish I packed.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: Huh... it's probably a little late for this, but...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 11.ogg Bennett: ...It looks kinda strange. Hmm, was there really something wrong with my cooking?
 Hate to say, I told you so...
 You might get food poisoning if you eat it.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 12.ogg Bennett: Ah! This is bad. This is all we've got in terms of supplies.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 13.ogg Bennett: I should have thought this through more...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 14.ogg Bennett: Hey, wait a minute...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 15.ogg Bennett: ...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 16.ogg Bennett: Maybe we can find another use for it...
 Like what?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 17.ogg Bennett: Long story short...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 18.ogg Bennett: I once got injured when I was in this severely dangerous place and I got knocked unconscious. I really thought that was going to be the end of me.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 19.ogg Bennett: But, turns out that's not how it went. Instead, according to Guild Master Cyrus who rescued me...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 20.ogg Bennett: After I lost consciousness, it was as if my bad luck just stopped affecting me. He took me back to Mondstadt without encountering any trouble at all along the way.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 21.ogg Bennett: And another time, I got knocked out in the field during a thunderstorm, but then I went the whole night without getting struck by lightning...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 22.ogg Bennett: I wonder if my bad luck is related to whether I'm awake or not. Or in other words, it might be my consciousness that brings me bad luck.
 You mean... you want to sacrifice yourself?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 23.ogg Bennett: Not really a sacrifice. I was just thinkin'...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 24.ogg Bennett: Maybe if I eat this strange dish... it's possible that I'll lose consciousness, right?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 25.ogg Bennett: Once my bad luck is gone, surely help will be here soon!
 No, you're sacrificing yourself for others again...
 Bennett, no way, that's just too tragic!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 26.ogg Bennett: Hehe, it's okay. It's better than dragging you and Royce down with me.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 27.ogg Bennett: You made a great point earlier when you said that I should take better care of myself, but right now, this is a life-or-death situation. Hope you can understand.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 28.ogg Bennett: Here goes!
 Bennett!

Media:vo bntcop001 1904405 bennett 29.ogg Bennett wolfs down his Ominous Dish...

The Police Station Register[]

(Go to the Tenryou Commission and talk to Uesugi)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 uesugi 01.ogg Uesugi: Oh, look who showed up! Heizou! You're finally back!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 uesugi 02.ogg Uesugi: Listen, if you took any longer to come back, everyone at the Police Station would be toast!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You say that every time I come back, Uesugi. However, something does feel a little unusual about the Police Station this time...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 uesugi 03.ogg Uesugi: C'mon, would I ever lie to you? Madam Kujou Sara is here and she's on the warpath! So be on the lookout.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Huh? What's that lady doing here?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 kujousara 01.ogg Kujou Sara: Doushin Shikanoin, I see you've finally returned. Please, enlighten us, what have you been doing recently?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Uh okay, I... was just out investigating a case.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 kujousara 02.ogg Kujou Sara: Don't give me that! I checked the records here. You didn't take any cases.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Uh actually, it's a case of personal relevance to me... These two can attest to that.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 kujousara 03.ogg Kujou Sara: Hmm? Traveler? Paimon? What are you two doing here?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We're the ones who brought Heizou back.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 kujousara 04.ogg Kujou Sara: Brought him back? Can someone please explain?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 owada 01.ogg Owada: Uh, well... Madam Kujou Sara... because we couldn't locate Doushin Shikanoin, we commissioned Detective Ryuuji from the detective agency...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 owada 02.ogg Owada: Shortly after, Ryuuji returned to tell us... uh, that he had given the commission to the Traveler, ahem... and then...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 kujousara 05.ogg Kujou Sara: Ugh, it used to be that the Tenryou Commission assisted others with disappearances, but it seems these days others are now assisting us... You've done it this time, Shikanoin, I think I've really seen it all.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Heh, I mean, is it really so unusual for officers and citizens to assist one another?
 Ahem... actually, he did seem to be investigating a case.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yeah, it was kinda weird, but it was definitely an investigation... he even pretended to be captured by Nobushi and Treasure Hoarders!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 kujousara 06.ogg Kujou Sara: Oh? Is that so? Well, since you are testifying for him, I suppose I won't ask any more questions...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 kujousara 07.ogg Kujou Sara: But since you're here, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), I have an extra favor to ask.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 kujousara 08.ogg Kujou Sara: I'd like you to be Shikanoin's temporary supervisor. It'll be your duty to ensure that he handles his case properly and that he doesn't disappear and neglect his work again.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 kujousara 09.ogg Kujou Sara: I'll be sure that the Police Station prepares the appropriate compensation.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 owada 03.ogg Owada: Oh, uh y—yes! Traveler, I'm sure we'd all really appreciate it!
 Um, well...
 (You cast a quick inquiring glance at Heizou.)
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm, Heizou seems to be happy with the idea, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hehe.
 Understood, leave it to me.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 kujousara 10.ogg Kujou Sara: You should thank the Traveler this time, Doushin Shikanoin. Otherwise, I don't think I would have let you off so easily.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 kujousara 11.ogg Kujou Sara: Here, take this letter of complaint, it's written against you. Please consider carefully what to do with it, I do not wish to see another one. Understood?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Huh? Someone filed a complaint...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: That can't be right, why would there be a complaint letter?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: You must not be doing your job properly, and now you're attracting complaints.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 uesugi 04.ogg Uesugi: No, it really doesn't add up, you two don't get it. Although Madam Kujou Sara just made some harsh remarks, we all know that Heizou senpai is a real whizz when it comes to cracking cases. He's the biggest asset on our team.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 uesugi 05.ogg Uesugi: Several leaders have risen through the ranks as a result of his achievements, he's definitely no slacker.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Then he must have gotten himself into some kind of trouble!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Well, let me see what's the deal here.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Oh, and since you agreed to be my temporary supervisor, you'll find the desk where new case files are kept right over there, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Would you mind helping me check what cases I need to deal with?
 I think you need to deal with your complaint letter first.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 heizou 12.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Of course, but first I have to confirm what's going on, and whether or not the letter's legit. Please have a look at the case files first.
(Talk to Uesugi again)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905602 uesugi 06.ogg Uesugi: This is quite unusual. Who could possibly lodge a complaint against Heizou? It's not easy being a Doushin.
(Talk to Owada)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905603 owada 01.ogg Owada: Interesting. Even Doushin Shikanoin can receive a complaint letter.
(Talk to Heizou)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905601 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hmm, let's see who's complaining about me here...

(Read the case file: An Approval Reply for "Heizou Talks Fraud")
An Approval Reply for "Heizou Talks Fraud": Police Station: Your application for the public awareness campaign "Heizou Talks Fraud" has been received. Following review, your station has been authorized to run the performance with Shikanoin Doushin in charge of the related work. — The Headquarters of the Tenryou Commission
Media:vo lyycop001 1905604 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: "Heizou Talks Fraud"? What's that? Sounds interesting, whatever it is.
(Read the case file: "Case of the Missing Eastern Express")
"Case of the Missing Eastern Express": The beloved dog, "Eastern Express," reportedly went missing late in the night. The owner discovered twelve canine footprints of varying sizes in the courtyard, leading to the initial assumption that the crime was carried out by a team...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905605 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Who would give a dog such a strange name?
(Read the case file: "The Prince of Mischief in Hanamizaka")
"The Prince of Mischief in Hanamizaka": There is a slacker who claims to be the "Prince of Mischief" terrorizing Hanamizaka. Children have reportedly been losing valuables in the area, the bulk of which are Onikabuto, Genius Invokation TCG cards, and so on...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905606 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What! Ugh, not him again...

The Three Case Files[]

(Talk to Heizou)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So, have you gone through the case files? Is there anything that caught your eye?
 An approval reply for "Heizou Talks Fraud."
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Oh? Have they approved it already? Huh, the Tenryou Commission certainly has become more efficient ever since Kujou Kamaji took office.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So what is "Heizou Talks Fraud"?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It's an anti-fraud public awareness event. Basically, think of it as a short play about fraud. We'll get a few people to perform an entertaining drama in order to raise public awareness about the issue.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ooh, so it's a play? Paimon likes the sound of that...
 I thought you're only interested in major cases, not petty things like fraud.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Haha well, see, fraud is a major issue here. You've traveled between different nations, I'm sure Mora isn't really an issue for you.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You have to understand that scamming the poor of their money is essentially robbing them of their lives. Left unchecked, the situation could potentially deteriorate into something more serious.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm, that makes sense... But will putting on a performance really work?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It's hard to say. Preventing crimes is more difficult than solving them, there's no doubt about that... but prevention is also a more worthwhile cause.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Maybe only a small number of people who attend the event will ever actually encounter a scam artist.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: And even then, of the handful of attendees who encounter said scam artist, I doubt many of them will be able to see through the scammer's ruse.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But if even only one person escapes the clutches of a scam artist because of my event, then I'm willing to put on this play for that person.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Alright, count us in! Today we are the anti-fraud messengers!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Haha, great. First, we need three actors, two to play the scam artists and one to play the victim.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I already have a couple candidates in mind for the roles of the scam artists, so come with me to the Grand Narukami Shrine.
(Proceed to The Shrewd Lady of the Grand Narukami Shrine)
 A dog named "Eastern Express" has gone missing.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 12.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Another dog's gone missing, huh? I know that the detective agency regularly receives such cases. You know, if we ever had the time, we could tally how many dogs go missing in Inazuma each day, and then...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 13.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Anyway, just leave that case to Uesugi. This complaint letter I received is more important.
(Proceed to Complaint Letter Branch)
 There might be a "Prince of Mischief" bullying children in Hanamizaka.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 14.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hmm, that case should be easy enough, just leave it to Uesugi. This complaint letter I received is more important.
(Proceed to Complaint Letter Branch)
 I'm more concerned about the complaint letter against you.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 15.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hmm, I'm afraid this won't be an easy task...
(Proceed to Complaint Letter Branch)

Complaint Letter Branch[]

Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 16.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I was hoping I wouldn't have to drag you into this, but it's just occurred to me that with your help, I might be able to wrap up this problem.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Alright then, tell us about the complaint letter.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 17.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It's from Sango, the president of Bantan Sango Detective Agency. I assume you've met her before?
 Yeah, I know you two have some beef, and it appears to be pretty serious.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 18.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You could say that... Sango's complaint letter accuses me of abusing my power for personal gain and blatantly concealing the truth behind the Ryuuji Case from years ago. Seriously, do I really seem like the type of person who'd do that?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hah, concealing the truth? That definitely sounds like something you would do!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905608 heizou 19.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hey hey hey, don't judge a book by its cover, alright! Let's just go to the detective agency and talk to Sango, we'll need to speak with her to get to the bottom of this.
(Proceed to Sango's Complaint Letter)

 That's not what a Dusk Bird's call sounds like.
Media:vo kycop001 1907302 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Really? No wonder they never pay attention to me... *sigh*... Forget it. I probably shouldn't be anthropomorphizing them anyway.
Media:vo kycop001 1907302 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Haven't seen you in some time, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). To which one of the Anemo Archon's winds do I owe the honor?
 Guess your natural charisma drew me here.
 Must be ordained by fate.

Media:vo kycop001 1907302 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Since it wasn't meant to be with this little birdie, I'd better leave it alone. Let's take a walk, shall we?

Media:vo kycop001 1907304 qabus 01.ogg ???: Gundafar, we are in the middle of a war. Your place is at the front lines by my son's side. Pray tell, what provokes your unwarranted return to the palace?
Media:vo kycop001 1907304 gundafar 01.ogg ???: A matter of utmost importance, Your Majesty, such that I must personally report it to you.
Media:vo kycop001 1907304 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Huh, outdoor theater? Looks fun.
 Where were we just now? Travel expenses? (This dialogue option leads to His Ideas.)
Media:vo kycop001 1907304 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Ah, yes. Here's what I was thinking about the unused funds...
Media:vo kycop001 1907304 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Given that the Acting Grand Master saw fit to allocate these funds to my trip in the first place, I think it's my responsibility to make sure that every last Mora is put to good use.
Media:vo kycop001 1907304 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: In other words... What do you say we find a way to spend the remaining budget?
Media:vo kycop001 1907304 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Perhaps a fancy meal at a nice restaurant? Or a river cruise that takes in the sights of Sumeru City? Or we could buy a few nice mementos to take home...
 Isn't this embezzlement?
 I can't believe you're talking so openly about living it up at the public's expense...
Media:vo kycop001 1907304 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Hey, no need to put it like that. Let's keep walking, we can consider it some more on the road.
 Do you wanna stop and see the show? (This dialogue option leads to The Stage.)
Media:vo kycop001 1907304 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Actually, yes. I saw some guards do a musical performance when I was traveling with their caravan in Sumeru.
Media:vo kycop001 1907304 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: They were desert-dwellers, so are these actors... Hehe, and I think I actually recognize one of them.
Media:vo kycop001 1907304 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Come on, let's go watch.

Do Not Alert Your Quarry[]

(Approach Zhouliang)
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 01.ogg Zhouliang: Ugh... I'm beat. Finally, I can take a break.
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 02.ogg Zhouliang: *sigh* I wonder if I took things a little too far... A few people seemed scared out of their minds.
 Who are you?
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 03.ogg Zhouliang: Huh? Hey, you shouldn't be here!
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 04.ogg Zhouliang: *sigh* Never mind. I assume you overheard me anyway.
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 05.ogg Zhouliang: I work here pretending to be a ghost, but now's my break time, so I took off my costume. I get all hot and stuffy wearing that thing...
 So there are no real ghosts here?
 It's all planned to scare people. right?
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 06.ogg Zhouliang: Of course, how could there be real ghosts here?
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 07.ogg Zhouliang: No one wants to see a real ghost, neither us nor the participants.
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 08.ogg Zhouliang: They just come here for the atmosphere, or should I say, the chance... Everyone wants the chance to feel the thrill of excitement.
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 09.ogg Zhouliang: When people find themselves in a scary situation, they'll say things that they'd never dare to otherwise. That's what the Test of Courage is all about.
 I think I understand.
 (Chongyun will be very disappointed.)
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 10.ogg Zhouliang: *sigh* Okay... I should get back to work now. Hope you and... whoever you're here with have a fun time.
(Go to Killjoy)

Warning! Dangerous Dog Outside Premises![]

(Look for the ninken that has wandered off into the wild)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Oh... see it? It's that one, just up ahead.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Judging by the breed and apparel, it definitely is a ninja dog from the Shuumatsuban.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: It's looking a little more docile today. Shall we try and get closer?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Oh, uh, you should stay a few paces behind me. I know it looks calm, but if it gets riled up, it could pounce and bite in an instant.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Here doggy, good doggy... you hungry my friend? I brought you a nice little snack...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 inushoushou 01.ogg Ninken: Woof! Woof! *growl*
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: You're a vicious little thing, aren't you? You almost bit me again!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: Look at you, wasting away... you must wanna eat a little something?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: You don't have to come back with us, but c'mon — a dog's gotta eat, right?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: You're not worried it's poisoned, are you? Here, I'll take the first bite.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: See? Delicious and poison-free.
 Thoma...
 You're really putting yourself out there...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Come on, just have a bite. A little tiny bite, and then I'll leave you alone, how's that sound?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 inushoushou 02.ogg Ninken: Woof! Woof, woof!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: Looks like it has zero intention of eating the food we brought... Is it just me, or does it look kind of on edge?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: Maybe it's something in the sea... Or something nearby that's got him on alert.
 Those monsters, perhaps?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: You think he was attacked by monsters... Hmm, it's possible.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: People do tend to lose their appetite in dangerous situations. Maybe it's the same for dogs, too. Let's clear out the area on behalf of our canine companion here.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: Thanks for helping out. This place should be a little more tranquil now, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).

(Observe the ninken's responses)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Here doggy, look — no more danger.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: You've gotta wanna eat a little something now? Come on, eat up, then let's get you back to Komore Teahouse.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Whatever's on your mind, you can tell me and Taroumaru all about it.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 inushoushou 01.ogg Ninken: Woof! Woof! *growl*
 It still doesn't want to cooperate.
 Looks like we failed...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: *sigh* Rejected again.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: And there I was thinking that I was the one it didn't like. I didn't expect it to be so on edge around you, too.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Well, to me, this proves that it simply doesn't want to leave this place. For now, let's not force it.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: Time to head back to the Yashiro Commission headquarters. I'll see if I can find its owner, so they can come and collect it.
 But it's from the Shuumatsuban...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: That's right — the Shuumatsuban only answer to the Yashiro Commissioner, Kamisato Ayato. Under most circumstances, no one else has the authority to inquire into their business.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: However, I was talking to Commissioner Ayato a while back, and he agreed to let me bend the rules in exceptional circumstances.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: That doesn't mean I can mobilize the Shuumatsuban to do my bidding, of course. But I'll be able to get the intel we need, no problem. It's sort of a prerogative I have.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 inushoushou 02.ogg Ninken: Woof! Woof, woof, woof!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Alright, there's a good dog, calm down. We're not gonna take you away.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: It's much safer here now, see? We're gonna leave now, make sure to give yourself a good rest.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: Alright, let's go, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
(Talk to Ninken again)
Ninken: Woof! Woof! *growl*

Those Who Can Never Return[]

(Ask Kazuaki)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 01.ogg Kazuaki: This ninja dog you speak of... it rings a bell.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 02.ogg Kazuaki: Could I trouble you to describe it again for me?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: A red Shiba, with a scar on its eye, dressed in black stealth wear...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 03.ogg Kazuaki: Ah, I think I know. You must be talking about Inu Shoushou.
 "Inu Shoushou"?
 Is that its name?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 04.ogg Kazuaki: That's right. I'm really surprised that's where you found him...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Perfect! Now that we've figured out his identity, we can get its owner to go and collect it.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: I should add, it's never good to have dogs run away like this. The poor thing's out there all on his own with no real food or shelter, day and night.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: So, shall we go find the owner and see if they have time to fetch him?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 05.ogg Kazuaki: I'm sorry. That won't be possible.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Why?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 06.ogg Kazuaki: I'm afraid I can't disclose the owner's identity.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 07.ogg Kazuaki: What I can tell you is they went out to sea on a dangerous mission, and... he won't be coming back.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 08.ogg Kazuaki: I had no idea that he hadn't taken Inu Shoushou along with him. Seems he decided to face this one alone.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 09.ogg Kazuaki: I can only assume that Inu Shoushou is waiting for his owner to come back, which is why he refuses to move from the beach...
 But that means...
 Inu Shoushou will be waiting forever...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Did Inu Shoushou's owner leave anything behind?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: You know, any personal items, or a Shuumatsuban uniform perhaps?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 10.ogg Kazuaki: Most of his possessions disappeared along with the man himself. The only thing I can think of is the Kunai he used to train with.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 11.ogg Kazuaki: Come with me. I'll see if I can find it for you.
You search the warehouse with Kazuaki:
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 12.ogg Kazuaki: Ah, yes, this looks like the one.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 13.ogg Kazuaki: The reason this Kunai stands out in my memory is because when he first joined the Shuumatsuban, he trained at it harder than anyone else, to the point where the tip became blunt from erosion.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 14.ogg Kazuaki: Take it. The Shuumatsuban will make sure to cover Inu Shoushou's daily expenses.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Thank you kindly. Let's just hope Inu Shoushou remembers the scent of this Kunai... Then again, I'm certain he will.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: Let's go pay Inu Shoushou another visit, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).

(Keep the ninken company with Thoma)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Hey, Inu Shoushou...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 inushoushou 01.ogg Inu Shoushou: Woof! ...Woof?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: I know, I know, how come this strange man suddenly knows your name?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: You're waiting for your master to come home, aren't you? Mind if we wait with you?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Don't worry, we're not looking to suddenly whisk you away. Look at this, do you know what it is?

A kunai that has lost its edge. You've heard that its user once used it while being put through a tough regimen.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 inushoushou 02.ogg Inu Shoushou: Woof, woof! Woof!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: As I thought. You remember.
 Inu Shoushou...
 He seems to be more affectionate this time.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Excellent. It looks like what he needed wasn't for us to take him away, but for us to accompany him.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: You know, I sometimes did this too, when I first arrived in Inazuma. I just stood on the beach, looking out at the horizon.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Everyone has people and events from their past that they look back on fondly. I guess we only grow when we realize that those things aren't coming back.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: The Shuumatsuban is not a peaceful organization, and being a ninja is an extremely dangerous profession.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: Many of the Shuumatsuban's ninjas have paid the ultimate price in the course of carrying out top-secret missions. The Shuumatsuban never discloses their identities, and doesn't publicly commemorate them.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: But at least now, Inu Shoushou, you're not the only one in the world who remembers him.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: From today onward, we will join you in honoring his memory.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 inushoushou 03.ogg Inu Shoushou: Woof...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: I think that means "deal," right, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 It's a deal alright.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: Hey, in the future, let's try and come back here from time to time, when we get the chance.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: Maybe we could build a little kennel for him. In the long-term, being out in the cold and wet like this could start to cause joint problems.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: I could make some winter clothes for him, too. In fact, I'd better get started...

 Quest DescriptionNoelle, who aims to become a Knight of Favonius, has shared her troubles with you and hopes that you'll be able to help her with her chivalric training. To display the fruits of her daily training to her, Noelle takes you to the Knights' training ground...

(Approach Ellin)
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 ellin 01.ogg Ellin: Hi, Noelle! Are you here for the training too?
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 ellin 02.ogg Ellin: Oh? Our Honorary Knight has come too.
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Hi, Ellin! I was just asking the Honorary Knight for training advice.
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: They want to see my basic skills first...
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Do you still have spare training dummies here?
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 ellin 03.ogg Ellin: Oh, Noelle's basic skills, huh? Then the normal dummies won't do...
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 ellin 04.ogg Ellin: Doesn't matter how we set them up, there'll be nothing left by the time Noelle's done with them.
 Nothing left...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 ellin 05.ogg Ellin: It is Noelle after all! Let me think... How should I arrange them...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 ellin 06.ogg Ellin: Ah! I've got it. One moment!
(14 training dummies are set up)
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 ellin 07.ogg Ellin: This will work much better for Noelle!
 Really? This won't be too difficult for her?
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Hmm... Could be a problem... There sure are a lot...
 Right? Surely it's too much.
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: It'll certainly require one heck of a clean-up.
(After the cutscene)
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Why is Noelle... Is she planning to destroy them all in one go?
(Talk to Ellin again)
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 ellin 08.ogg Ellin: Go, Noelle! You can do it!
(Fail to destroy all in time)
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 ellin 09.ogg Ellin: *sigh* What a pity... So close! Wanna try again?

(After destroying them all)
Media:vo noecop001 1906401 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: ...She really got all of them!
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Whew! Finally, clean-up over!
 Such incredible strength...
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Y—You're... too kind! Praise from the Honorary Knight is high praise indeed...
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: But sadly I'm afraid that... my strength is the only thing I truly am confident in...
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Every time I train and compete with the knights, I can't figure out how to use it.
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Even though I swing my blade with greater force than my opponent, I always seem to lose in the final moments.
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: No matter how hard I train, I can never pass the selection trials.
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Why? I just can't figure it out...
 Is it because you lack real-world fighting experience?
(Go to Branch 1)
 Because... You still need more strength!
(Go to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 Is it because you lack real-world fighting experience?
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Real-world fighting experience?
 Noelle, you've always worked as a maid in Mondstadt, right?
 Noelle, you rarely leave Mondstadt for training, right?
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: I guess... That's true.
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: After all, if I were to leave the city, I wouldn't be there when people needed me...
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: But you're right, I haven't had much real-world fighting experience... Where can I get some?
 You could start by training in the areas around Mondstadt.
 Slimes are a good starting point.
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Areas around Mondstadt... Slimes... leave them to me!
(Proceed to Live Practice)

Branch 2[]

 Because... You still need more strength!
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: More... strength...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: But of course... Compared the the Honorary Knight, who defeated Stormterror, I don't have nearly enough strength...
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: Please teach me, Honorary Knight! How do you normally train?
 I use my sword for mining all over Teyvat.
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: Mining? You use your sword for... mining?
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: Then again... mining builds arm strength... and then there's the hiking between ore veins... perhaps even a monster or two to fight along the way...
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: So this is the Honorary Knight's training method, right? I must try it!
 Prepare yourself, mining isn't as easy as you think.
Media:vo noecop001 1906402 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: No problem! Leave it to me!

Dialogue[]
 Quest DescriptionHuffman has his hands full with cleanup work that followed the storm...

(Talk to Huffman)
Huffman: There's still so much cleaning up to do...
 What's the matter?
Huffman: As I'm sure you're aware, we faced continuous attacks from bands of monsters for the entire duration of the Stormterror incident.
Huffman: Although the Stormterror incident is now resolved, and we've successfully fended off the monsters...
Huffman: The monsters erected quite a substantial number of barricades outside the city of the course of their raids.
Huffman: So while the monsters themselves have been fought back... these barricades aren't about to disappear of their own accord.
Huffman: We can't just leave them here indefinitely, especially now that things are returning to business as usual in the city.
Huffman: Unfortunately, the Knights are short-staffed and there's simply no one to take on the task. As our Honorary Knight, would you be willing to clear up the barricades?
 It is my honor to serve.
Huffman: Spoken like a true member of the Knights of Favonius! Honorary Knight, you have my gratitude.
 Sorry, I have something else on...
Huffman: Well, I don't doubt that you must have far more important matters to attend to. In which case, never mind, I shall have to think of something else.
(Cancels the quest)

(At the first blockade)
Paimon: He wasn't kidding, look at all this junk. Worst thing in the world for foot traffic...
Paimon: Let's smash them all to pieces!
(At the second blockade)
Paimon: There's still more? How'd they put up all these in such a short time, anyway?
Paimon: Ugh, what does it matter. Let's clear them all up, then we won't have to think about it any longer.
(At the third blockade)
Paimon: There are soooo many! Geez, how long were they planning this for?
Paimon: Not long enough, clearly! The last traces of their big master plan are disappearing right before Paimon's very eyes!
Paimon: Come on, let's clean this area up, pronto!
(After clearing all obstacles)
Paimon: Alrighty, our work here is done. Let's go speak to Huffman again.

(Report back to Huffman)
Huffman: How's your progress? Finished clearing the area yet?
 All done.
Huffman: Fantastic. You've been an enormous help, who knows how much longer those ugly things would've been stood there otherwise.
Huffman: Honorary Knight, please accept these as an expression of my gratitude.

A Friend's Path[]
 Quest DescriptionWhile writing replies, Gorou encounters a letter from one of his subordinates and is once again troubled...

(Hand the finished replies over to Yae Publishing House)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 kuroda 01.ogg Kuroda: Great, that's all the replies for this round accounted for.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 kuroda 02.ogg Kuroda: Thank you for your hard work, Ms. Hi— Mr. Gorou.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Think nothing of it. I agreed to help, so it's only right that I do the best I can.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), could I trouble you to come back to Watatsumi Island with me?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: I want to find that soldier. Not to persuade him to stay, I just... I don't want him to leave without saying goodbye.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Kazuha once told me that the bonds between people whose paths have crossed can never be broken, even after they part ways.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: But... maybe I'm scared he might be wrong. People can change quickly, and I worry that the next time I meet my comrade who fought so bravely alongside me, there will already be some distance between us.
 Let's go visit them together.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: Great. Then let's head off whenever you're ready.

 Step DescriptionHave a little chat with some of the troops on Watatsumi Island to help soothe Gorou's heart.

(Chat with the soldiers on Watatsumi Island)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 01.ogg Denjirou: General Gorou, and... Captain of Swordfish II?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 02.ogg Denjirou: General, Captain, are you here to inspect the camp?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Uh...not [sic] this time. I just thought I'd come by to catch up while everyone has some downtime.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 toshihiko 01.ogg Toshihiko: Certainly, General Gorou! Anything you want to discuss, we'll share whatever we know!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 toshihiko 02.ogg Toshihiko: But we haven't been out of the camp lately, so we don't have a whole lot of interesting stories...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Actually, I've had something on my mind, and wanted to ask everyone's thoughts on the matter.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: You see, after the war, Her Excellency streamlined the army, and a lot of people were transferred to other duties.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Do you still have much contact with each other?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 03.ogg Denjirou: To be honest... not much.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 04.ogg Denjirou: We're so busy even just with training and patrolling that it's almost impossible to squeeze in the time to meet up.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 05.ogg Denjirou: We have holidays, but we usually use them to go home and spend time with our nearest and dearest. Besides, everyone's vacations come at different times. Our schedules rarely overlap.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 toshihiko 03.ogg Toshihiko: Yeah, I'm busy when they're free, and they're busy when I'm free.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 toshihiko 04.ogg Toshihiko: Anyway, even if we did manage to meet up — what then? We all do different jobs now, and we all have new friends who aren't mutually acquainted. I'm not sure what we'd talk about.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: So that's really how it goes, huh...
 We all go through it.
 It's part of life.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: I know, it's okay, I just... it just seems a pity, that's all.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 06.ogg Denjirou: You know... having said all that, there's something else that I've always felt about this.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: Really?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 07.ogg Denjirou: Yes. I feel that no matter how long we're apart, and no matter what we might go through in the meantime, all of us will be straight back here if Watatsumi Island is ever in danger.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 08.ogg Denjirou: Even if we've all changed beyond recognition, we can always trust that we've got each other's backs. That's one thing that's never going to change!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 toshihiko 05.ogg Toshihiko: We're your troops, General Gorou. You trained us, took us into battle, and led the way as we charged against the enemy.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 toshihiko 06.ogg Toshihiko: Even if we seldom keep in contact now, we are still brothers in arms. If you say the word, we will all pick up our weapons again at a moment's notice.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 toshihiko 07.ogg Toshihiko: Long live the resistance!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: Heh... hahaha.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: Yes, that's the way it should be. Long live the resistance!
 Long live the resistance!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: I won't disturb you any further. You guys keep training hard. Regarding everything else, I'm sure it'll all be fine.
After joking around with the soldiers for a time, you hear approaching footsteps...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 tsuneo 01.ogg Tsuneo: Ah, General Gorou. You're here.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 tsuneo 02.ogg Tsuneo: I believe Hiroaki's been hoping to catch you. He's been waiting at the camp for a long time, but never saw you return.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 tsuneo 03.ogg Tsuneo: Are you planning to head back to camp later? If you're busy, I can go and let him know so he's not waiting there in vain.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Tell him I'll be right over.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: I know what I have to do now... Come with me (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), let's head to the camp.

Those Who Depart[]
 Step DescriptionNo longer feeling lost, Gorou decides to face his subordinate's request head on.

(Go with Gorou to look for Hiroaki)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: Denjirou is right. No matter what changes the future may bring, we will always have each other's backs.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: Sure, there may be some awkward silences when we meet again after a long time, but in no time at all we'd be the best of friends again.

(Talk to Hiroaki)
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 01.ogg Hiroaki: General Gorou, I...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 02.ogg Hiroaki: I... I would like to request permission to leave the resistance, Sir!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 03.ogg Hiroaki: I know this may seem very abrupt, and in fact I have only just made the decision...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: It's alright.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 04.ogg Hiroaki: Back then... I had so much hatred for the Vision Hunt Decree, and so much disappointment in Narukami Island for supporting it. But after the war ended, I wanted to go back and visit... but I still couldn't make up my mind...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 05.ogg Hiroaki: Thanks to Ms. Hina's encouragement, I was finally able to find the courage to talk to you about it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 06.ogg Hiroaki: Of course, if you disapprove, I'll obey your orders. I am your subordinate, after all.
 Ms. Hina?
 I don't recognize that name...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Ms. Hina? Who's that?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 07.ogg Hiroaki: It's a long story...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: Forget it, never mind her. I approve your application to leave the resistance.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 08.ogg Hiroaki: General Gorou... I...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Come on, don't look so down. It's not like we're never going to see each other again.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: If you ever have the time, you should come back and visit Watatsumi Island. There is no need to limit yourself to a specific place — just do what you want to do.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: No matter where we are, we will always be comrades.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 09.ogg Hiroaki: ...Yes, General!
You send the soldiers off to the seashore...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 10.ogg Hiroaki: I'll take my leave then. Take care of yourself, General Gorou!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: Take care!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: That was... that was okay.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: Or should I say... it's for the best? (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: This is how it should be... it should leave you with a smile on your face, just like this.

Dialogue[]
 Quest DescriptionNingguang would like to relive the experiences she had when she was just starting out. She thus invites you to play a game of starting from the very bottom. When you mention the Northland Bank, she decides to let you have a look at how things are now.

(Go to Northland Bank)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913701 ekaterina 01.ogg Ekaterina: Lady Ningguang...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913701 ekaterina 02.ogg Ekaterina: I would hope that you're not here to create further trouble for the Fatui?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913701 ekaterina 03.ogg Ekaterina: With all due respect, too much official pressure will risk driving our bank out of business.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913701 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: There is no need to be so hostile.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913701 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: I'm just here to talk business. So, are you in business or not?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913701 ekaterina 04.ogg Ekaterina: That depends on the proposal. And it's not my decision alone.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913701 ekaterina 05.ogg Ekaterina: But first, tell me. Why should we believe that you really are here for business?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913701 ekaterina 06.ogg Ekaterina: Because if you're here to make us suffer huge losses like last time, then I'm sorry. But none of us here can afford that.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913701 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: Straight to the point, I see. Works for me.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913701 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: Traveler, we're leaving. Let's not waste any more of our time here.
(Talk to Andrei)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913701 andrei 01.ogg Andrei: Lady Ningguang...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913701 andrei 02.ogg Andrei: Please go to the counter if there's something you need.
(Talk to Ekaterina again)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913702 ekaterina 01.ogg Ekaterina: I have a lot on my plate right now. You can see yourselves out.

A Clumsy Cover-Up[]
 Step DescriptionThe reception at the Northland Bank is frosty. You and Ningguang can only leave. But right after you do, you immediately sense someone's eyes on you. Most curious...

(Leave the Northland Bank and talk to Ningguang)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913702 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Do you see what I mean now? Their attitude was just as I expected.
 They were not even trying to hide their hostility towards you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913702 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: That's for sure. Although our diplomatic relations with Snezhnaya haven't broken down completely, I dealt them a rather ruthless blow with the size of the reparations payment I imposed.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913702 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: This sum was paid by Northland Bank, so they are still wary of me to this day.
 So it is true. The Northland Bank is just an arm of the Fatui.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913702 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: Yes. With some exceptions, but that is more or less correct.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913702 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: If you encounter them in any other nations during your travels, be on your guard. They are more than just a commercial organization.
 Well, now I know... Does that make this trip worth it...?
 I guess I shouldn't have included this as an option...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913702 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: That's okay. My intention here was to show you some of the repercussions of that great battle.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913702 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: But that's quite enough politics for today. Let's get back to our fun little survival game.
 Wait a second.
 Can you sense it?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913702 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Now that you mention it... Yes. We're being watched.
 I think they've been following us since we left Northland Bank.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913702 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: What are they plotting this time?
 Let's grab them and ask the question.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913702 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: Mm, my thoughts exactly. But we need to be discreet. If they realize we're onto them, we will lose the element of surprise.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913702 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: Let's act natural, determine who our tail is, then lure them somewhere more deserted, so we can catch them.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913702 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: Keep moving. Just walk forward at normal pace and don't do anything to give away that we suspect anything.

(Follow Ningguang and observe your surroundings)
(Talk to Ningguang)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913703 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Okay, I think we have a few potential suspects.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913703 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: There's a lot of foot traffic here, but if you look closely, you'll see only a handful of people have been watching us constantly.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913703 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: But... I'm still not sure which of them is our tail...
 Let's keep going for now.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913703 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: Agreed. Whoever it is will continue to follow us.

(Follow Ningguang and observe your surroundings carefully again)
(Talk to Ningguang)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913707 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: I think we've narrowed it down a little further.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913707 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: But let's stay calm until we're 100% sure.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913707 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: It shouldn't take much longer.

(Talk to a Suspicious Person during one of the "observe your surroundings" steps)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913704 suspiciouspersona 01.ogg Suspicious Person: What's the big idea? I'm enjoying the view here.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913704 suspiciouspersona 02.ogg Suspicious Person: Quit bothering me.
(−1 Heart)
(Talk to a Suspicious Person during one of the "observe your surroundings" steps)

Media:vo ngcop001 1913705 suspiciouspersonb 02.ogg Suspicious Person: Never mind. I'll keep looking.

(Talk to a Suspicious Person during one of the "observe your surroundings" steps)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913706 suspiciouspersonc 01.ogg Suspicious Person: Shall I have noodles or rice tonight...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913706 suspiciouspersonc 02.ogg Suspicious Person: Or maybe... what about both?

(Talk to a Suspicious Person during one of the "observe your surroundings" steps)

Media:vo ngcop001 1913708 suspiciouspersonb 02.ogg Suspicious Person: I'm going to be in huge trouble when I get back home.
(−1 Heart)
(Talk to a Suspicious Person during one of the "observe your surroundings" steps)

(Talk to Ningguang)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913711 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: I think I have the answer.
 Me too.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913711 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Let's get out of his line of sight and sneak up on him.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913711 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: Don't get the wrong person, though, or all our efforts will have been for nothing.

The Snare[]

(Find the person following you)
(If the player talks to the wrong person)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913712 suspiciouspersonb 01.ogg Suspicious Person: What is it?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913712 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Mmm, wrong guy.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913712 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Ugh! He got away...
(−5 Hearts)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913713 suspiciouspersond 01.ogg Suspicious Person: Hey. What is it?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913713 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Mmm, wrong guy.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913713 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Ugh! He got away...
(−5 Hearts)
(If all Hearts are exhausted)
Hangout Event Ended
You chose the wrong person and startled the person tailing you, causing them to flee. Ningguang will have to come up with some other plan...
(Talk to the right person)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 suspiciouspersona 01.ogg Suspicious Person: Ah! What are you doing!?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Come now, did you really think we wouldn't notice you sneaking around?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 suspiciouspersona 02.ogg Suspicious Person: What? I... I'm not doing anything.
 Come clean.
 There's no use trying to deny it.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: I don't know what scheme Northland Bank has in the works, and I don't know what they're paying you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: But let's make a deal. How cooperative you are now decides how much immunity I give you when this gets investigated.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 suspiciouspersona 03.ogg Suspicious Person: Uh... uh...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: Or do you seriously think Northland Bank won't throw you to the wolves when push comes to shove?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: Why don't you weigh the pros and cons and give me a clear answer before I retract my offer.
 (She is stern!)
 (She's not giving him a moment to breathe...)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 suspiciouspersona 04.ogg Suspicious Person: S—Sorry, Lady Ningguang. My assignment was just to follow you, I promise. That's it...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 suspiciouspersona 05.ogg Suspicious Person: When you showed up unannounced at Northland Bank, everyone was instantly on high alert. We figured you must be up to something, but your brief conversation left us none the wiser as to your intentions.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 suspiciouspersona 06.ogg Suspicious Person: We couldn't just overlook it. We had to get to the bottom of it before we could put our minds at rest.
 Are they really this guarded against you?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: I know they're wary of me, but this is still an overreaction, surely...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: This all feels very suspicious. There must be more to this than he is letting on.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Hmph, I only took you there to demonstrate how tense things are. Somehow we only tested the waters but ended up with the catch of the day.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: Is there anyone else following us besides you?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 suspiciouspersona 07.ogg Suspicious Person: Yes. They would have seen this and reported back.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: Then we need to get moving. The longer they have to react, the fewer clues they'll leave behind.
 Don't you need to prepare?
 Don't you need more evidence?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: No time. I'll just have to improvise.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913714 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: Keep him with you. Do not let him slip away.

Confrontation[]

(Go back to Northland Bank for a confrontation)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913715 ekaterina 01.ogg Ekaterina: Argh! Are you saying that Ningguang hasn't done anything?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913715 ekaterina 02.ogg Ekaterina: Impossible. She wouldn't have shown up here out of the blue without good reason.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913715 ekaterina 03.ogg Ekaterina: Keep investigating. We must ascertain her intentions...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913715 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: So much commotion. This must be an important meeting.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913715 ekaterina 04.ogg Ekaterina: Oh, great...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913715 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: It looks like I wasn't supposed to be privy to the contents of this particular meeting. This simplifies things.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913715 ekaterina 05.ogg Ekaterina: So you are here to investigate us, after all.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913715 ekaterina 06.ogg Ekaterina: Where did you get wind of this...?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913715 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: That doesn't matter.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913715 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: What matters is that I made a brief and inconsequential visit, and your first reaction was to immediately arrange a sizable surveillance operation with myself as the target.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913715 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: You couldn't have advertised your guilty conscience more clearly if you'd tried.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913715 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: You may as well come clean. You know I will not turn a blind eye to any violation of the rules in Liyue Harbor.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913715 ekaterina 07.ogg Ekaterina: (Ugh, even if we cooperate with her investigation, she's bound to find problems even where there are none...)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913715 ekaterina 08.ogg Ekaterina: Well, if you're such a stickler for the rules, you can carry out your investigation by the book. The Northland Bank has no obligation to cooperate. Even with a member of the Liyue Qixing.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913715 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: Fine by me. Then I'll take my time. But you'll be begging to tell me everything by the time I'm through.

Dialogue[]
Accidental Encounter[]
 Quest DescriptionYou meet Gorou and Yae Miko near Yae Publishing House. Gorou seems to be somewhat troubled...

(Talk to Gorou)
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: I really can't recommend that store highly enough. A couple more visits, and you'll find that the fur on your tail is silky-smooth.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: A gorgeous tail like yours deserves lots of tender loving care. Hehe... don't you agree?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: No need, I'm not interested in that kind of thing.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: You say that... but do I see your ears saying otherwise?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: Although your tail isn't professionally maintained, the fur doesn't look dry and coarse. To me, this says you like to take care of it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 05.ogg Yae Miko: I'm also guessing that you like to curl up into a fetal position and hug your fluffy tail tight as you go off to sleep.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: How do you kn— Ahem!
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 46.ogg Gorou: Don't be ridiculous! I'm a high-ranking general of Watatsumi Island, how could I do such a thing!
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 06.ogg Yae Miko: It's okay, there's no need to be embarrassed. The desire to cuddle up to a soft tail while sleeping is quite natural.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: Really?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Wait, no, why are we still on this topic...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: In fact, why am I even here talking about tails with you in the first place?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 07.ogg Yae Miko: Why... Because you are blessed with a wonderful fluffy tail, that's why. I think it's very cute.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: Argh, I'm trapped... how do I get out of this...
 Alright, that's enough!
 Don't bully Gorou!
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)... Thank goodness.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: Please, save me...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 08.ogg Yae Miko: Oh? And how is my favorite little one doing, hmm?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 09.ogg Yae Miko: I didn't expect to meet you here. We were just talking about tails...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 10.ogg Yae Miko: Gorou has a beautiful tail, don't you think? Doesn't it make you want to stroke it?
 (Look warily at Yae Miko)
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 11.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, don't be nervous. Just follow your heart's desire.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 09a.ogg Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 09b.ogg Gorou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)'s not going to fall for it. We've fought side by side!
 (Steal a glance at Gorou's tail)
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: Hey! Not you too...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 12.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe. Gorou, now do you understand how appealing your tail is?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 aratani 01.ogg Aratani: Pardon me. Lady Guuji, we have completed the matter you instructed us about previously.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 aratani 02.ogg Aratani: We have selected a very skilled artist to be in charge. I'm confident that the finished products will be to your satisfaction...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 13.ogg Yae Miko: I'll take a look later, and if everything's in order, place it in front of the store.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 14.ogg Yae Miko: Alright, I won't tease the two of you any further.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 15.ogg Yae Miko: Do make the most of your trip here, won't you? Quite a lot has changed.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 16.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe... I wish you both a fun-filled time on Narukami Island.
Yae Miko and the Yae Publishing House editor depart...

Countermeasure Conference[]

(Talk to Gorou about how to deal with the situation)
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: There was definitely something strange about the way she looked at me at the end there... Could she be plotting something?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: Sorry that you had to see that. The real reason I'm here at Yae Publishing House is to buy some books for Her Excellency.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: Since Watatsumi Island signed a peace treaty with the Shogunate, we've had much closer contact than we did before.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: I also wanted to come and see what things are like in an area ruled by the Shogunate. I hadn't counted on running into her...
 Do you know Yae Miko well?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 15.ogg Gorou: I've interacted with her a few times before, but I can't say I've ever gotten used to it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 16.ogg Gorou: I've never been good at dealing with people like her. The way she towers over me, and speaks so cryptically... something about her is strangely intimidating...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 17.ogg Gorou: I could probably deal with her in battle, but I don't know where to start when I run into her in normal life. I guess this is a weakness of mine.
 It's okay, let's just ignore her.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 33.ogg Gorou: You're right. I've heard Her Excellency say the same thing before — in any battle, you need to think about how to avoid your shortcomings. As long as I don't come into contact with Yae Miko, everything should be fine.
 Actually, Yae Miko's not all bad...
(Proceed to Branch 3)
 Let's steer clear of Yae Publishing House for now, then.
(Proceed to Branch 4)
 Why don't I help you overcome this weakness?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 18.ogg Gorou: Really? That would be great.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 19.ogg Gorou: To be honest, this is something that's always worried me. If the soldiers ever saw me in this kind of embarrassing situation, they'd be very disappointed.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 20.ogg Gorou: So, I have to overcome it. For their sake.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 21.ogg Gorou: As soon as I've worked through this, let's go take on Yae Miko again!
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 22.ogg Gorou: First things first, though. Do you have any ideas on where to begin, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 We can start with some theoretical study...
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 I can act as a personality you find difficult to deal with...
(Proceed to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 We can start with some theoretical study...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 30.ogg Gorou: Good plan.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 31.ogg Gorou: Start by studying some theory, address the fear at its root, and then I'll have nothing to be afraid of.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 32.ogg Gorou: But where would I go to learn about this? I wouldn't know anyone on Narukami Island... Oh! Let's go back to Watatsumi Island and ask around there.
(Proceed to What Shall We Do?)

Branch 2[]

 I can act as a personality you find difficult to deal with...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 23.ogg Gorou: I see. So if you pretend to be someone like her, I can keep practicing on you.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 24.ogg Gorou: If I can get the better of you, then I'll be able to hold my own when similar situations come up in the future.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 25.ogg Gorou: Good plan! Let's see... Where should we start?
 Have you found yourself in scenarios like this before?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 26.ogg Gorou: Now that you mention it, I remember having a similar experience back on Watatsumi Island.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 27.ogg Gorou: I was with my subordinates at the time. We ran into a merchant, I got caught up talking to them, and I don't quite know what happened, but I ended up buying a lot of things from them.
 Then I'll pretend to be a merchant!
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 28.ogg Gorou: I think we can give it a try. There's an island called Ritou nearby — why don't we go there?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 29.ogg Gorou: I heard all the outlander merchants are based there, so it might help to create the right atmosphere.
(Proceed to Special Training)

Branch 3[]

 Actually, Yae Miko's not all bad...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 41.ogg Gorou: Really? Phew, well, it's a relief to hear that.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 42.ogg Gorou: In that case, I still have some business to take care of with the Yae Publishing House.
 What is it?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 43.ogg Gorou: They run a monthly magazine called "That's Life," which has an advice column. Readers write in about their problems, and I'm responsible for responding to them.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 44.ogg Gorou: I'm not quite sure why they chose me, but it's my job now, and I can't give it up just like that.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 45.ogg Gorou: Yae Miko just handed me the latest batch of readers' letters. Let's find a place to write the replies, then pack them up and send them back to Yae Publishing House.
(Proceed to The Secret Behind the Letters)

Branch 4[]

 Let's steer clear of Yae Publishing House for now, then.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 34.ogg Gorou: Okay, whatever you think's best. Let's avoid Yae Publishing House for now.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 35.ogg Gorou: Actually, there's something else I have to sort out while I'm on Narukami Island. It's a personal matter.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 36.ogg Gorou: Back when we were fighting the Shogun's Army at Nazuchi Beach, I had a box with me that contained some very important items.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 37.ogg Gorou: The odds were stacked against us that day, and the resistance was forced to retreat. I had to abandon the box, but I managed to quickly bury it first.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 38.ogg Gorou: I went back to collect it on this trip, but it turned out someone had already dug it up. So I asked around the area, and the locals said that apparently, the Adventurers' Guild had beaten me to it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 39.ogg Gorou: That box is very important to me. I have to get it back from the Adventurers' Guild. Would you mind coming along?
 No problem.
 Well, since you asked...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 40.ogg Gorou: Thank you so much. Let's head right over — time is of the essence.
(Proceed to Ordinary Memorial)

The Secret Behind the Letters[]
 Step DescriptionGorou would like to finish writing replies to his readers, and you decide to help him out.

(Go to a quiet spot to finish writing the replies)
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: This place looks nice and quiet.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Why don't we write the replies here? The sooner I get them finished and handed back to the publisher, the sooner we can go do something else.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: I just hope I don't have another run-in with you-know-who at Yae Publishing House later...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Anyway, the writing could take me some time. The questions I receive are often so strange that I have to think long and hard about how to best answer them.
 I'll stay and keep you company.
(Proceed to Branch 6)
 I'll go keep watch at Yae Publishing House.
(Proceed to Branch 5)

Branch 5[]

 I'll go keep watch at Yae Publishing House.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 50.ogg Gorou: Ah, you want to scout ahead?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 51.ogg Gorou: Yeah, that works. This way, if Yae Miko's lying in wait for me there, I can avoid her.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 52.ogg Gorou: But stay sharp, okay! She is a force to be reckoned with... you must be sure to tread carefully.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 53.ogg Gorou: If you spot her, get yourself back here right away, and we'll run for our lives!
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 54.ogg Gorou: I mean, um, ahem, we'll make a strategic retreat... Anyway. I'm counting on you.
(Proceed to Secret Identity)

Branch 6[]

 I'll stay and keep you company.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: Great. Let's write the replies together. I'm actually interested to hear your perspective.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: Let me see here... hmm, let's start with this one.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: "Today, a new guy came to our village. He was good-looking and had a lovely voice."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: "When I peeked at him from behind the door, I felt my cheeks getting hotter, and my heart started beating faster and faster..."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: See, I can tell right away that this is exactly the kind of question I'm no good at dealing with. The letter seems to be from a young lady... which is not a demographic where I can offer much expertise...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), what's your take?
 It sounds like she's falling in love.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Hmm... Well, I don't know what it's like to be in love, but if you say so, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), I think it makes sense.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: I'll reply like this then: "It's likely that the feelings you're experiencing right now won't occur many times in your life. I urge you to summon the courage to seize this opportunity and see where it takes you — no matter where that may be."
 More professional than I expected...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: What? Really?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: But that's how it is in battle, too. Opportunities to seize victory are fleeting — when they arise, you have to capitalize on them right away.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 15.ogg Gorou: I imagine it's the same in love? That's my suggestion, anyway... Come on, let's read the next letter.
 It sounds like she's falling ill.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 16.ogg Gorou: Hmmm... I think so too.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 17.ogg Gorou: Many soldiers have developed similar symptoms in the past when we march in the rain. It's easy to catch a cold in wet weather.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 18.ogg Gorou: I've taken care of ill soldiers personally in the past, so I know this problem well.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 19.ogg Gorou: Hmm, I'll reply: "The temperature has dropped recently, and it's likely that you've caught a cold. Taking medicine will be an important part of your recovery, but don't overlook the importance of keeping warm and getting plenty of rest, too."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 20.ogg Gorou: I think that should do... Come on, let's read the next letter.
 What does this one say?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 21.ogg Gorou: "My neighbor is always borrowing money from me, but never seems to be able to pay me back on time. I have tried subtly raising the issue in conversation several times, but he always finds a way to dodge my questions..."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 22.ogg Gorou: "He was kind to me when I was young. I don't want to make things ugly, but the money issue bothers me a lot. Please help me."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 23.ogg Gorou: If this is a dispute between neighbors, it must be settled as soon as possible. It's like when conflict arises between generals in the army — the proper policy is to resolve it without delay.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 24.ogg Gorou: The most important thing in military regulations is fairness. It is only right to pay back a debt. I want to suggest that the writer demands their money back in no uncertain terms. Do you think it makes sense?
 I completely agree.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 25.ogg Gorou: Okay, so let's reply along those lines.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 26.ogg Gorou: Let me think... how about this: "It is good that you want to repay your neighbor's kindness, but be aware that you can find other ways to do this that don't involve lending them money. Right now, the most important thing for you to do is demand your money back. Being kind does not mean allowing your neighbor to walk all over you."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 27.ogg Gorou: And we are done with that letter. The next one seems longer, let me see...
 Perhaps take a softer tone...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 28.ogg Gorou: That makes sense, too. Giving the neighbor an ultimatum would likely harm the relationship between them.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 29.ogg Gorou: But the letter also makes it clear that no matter how many hints the writer gives him, the neighbor won't return the money...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 30.ogg Gorou: In that case, how about we reply like this:
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 31.ogg Gorou: "Why not ask to borrow some money from your neighbor? Any sum he agrees to lend you can be used to offset the amount he owes. Even if he refuses to lend to you, at least by asking to borrow from him, you are sending him the message that your own financial position is far from optimal, and he will be unlikely to ask you for money again in the near future."
 Are you sure that will work?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 32.ogg Gorou: I don't know. But it's worth a try. The most important thing is to muster the courage to resist, and not give the other person the impression that you are someone they can take advantage of.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 33.ogg Gorou: And we are done with this letter. The next one seems longer, let me see...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 34.ogg Gorou: "Hello, I was born on Narukami Island and I'm now a soldier in the resistance..."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 35.ogg Gorou: So this is from one of my troops?
 Is it someone you know?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 36.ogg Gorou: Most likely. But I'm not sure who.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 37.ogg Gorou: Before passing any readers' letters on to me, Yae Publishing House has their staff copy each one by hand and redact all names in the process.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 38.ogg Gorou: So I can't be sure who exactly this is... anyway, let's keep reading.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 39.ogg Gorou: "I couldn't turn a blind eye to the Vision Hunt Decree, and my anger drove me to join the resistance. My comrades and I have fought side by side, and I have formed deep friendships with them."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 40.ogg Gorou: "Since we achieved our goal and the war came to an end, I have remained on Watatsumi Island. But this is not my hometown, and I often find myself dreaming of the cherry blossoms falling on Narukami Island."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 41.ogg Gorou: "I now don't know whether to stay here or return home. The resistance has treated me well, and I've long been disillusioned by the Shogunate, but my hometown tugs constantly at my heartstrings..."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 42.ogg Gorou: How should I reply to him, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 You'll have to answer this one, Gorou.
 I can't help you this time.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 43.ogg Gorou: Let me think about it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 44.ogg Gorou: To be blunt, I obviously don't want any soldiers under my command to leave.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 45.ogg Gorou: But, if making them stay causes them pain... how are my actions any different from the Vision Hunt Decree?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 46.ogg Gorou: I suppose I'll reply... "Narukami Island has changed. You should go back and visit."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 47.ogg Gorou: ...That should do it.
 Gorou...
 Are you okay?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 48.ogg Gorou: I'll be okay. Come on, let's finish the rest of the letters.
You help Gorou write all the replies...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 49.ogg Gorou: Thanks to you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), writing the responses went very smoothly this time. Let's go and deliver them to the Yae Publishing House, shall we?
(Proceed to A Friend's Path)

Temporary Escape[]
 Quest DescriptionWith your aid, Akira has made his escape for now, but can he really get away with this?

(Talk to Kuki Shinobu)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914801 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Did you find anything, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 Nope...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914801 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: That's too bad. My search didn't turn anything up, either.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914801 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I just spoke to a Doushin. Apparently, the Kairagi are smuggling some supplies, and they've hidden them in this area.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914801 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: They could come back at any moment to collect them. I just hope Akira doesn't run into them.
 These smuggled supplies...
 What do they look like?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914801 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I'm told they're stored in a few wooden boxes...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914801 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: What's wrong? You have this really weird look on your face right now.
 That's where Akira is!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914801 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Wait, what? Never mind, let's go!

Overly Obvious Clues[]

(Approach the location)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914802 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Is this the place, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 Yeah...
 But...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914802 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: No boxes, and a whole bunch of footprints... We got here just too late.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914802 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: They can't have been gone for long, and with the supplies weighing them down, they couldn't have gotten far. Let's follow the footprints!

(After leaving the beach)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914803 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Hmm... Beyond this point there are weeds everywhere, and the footprints are hard to make out...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914803 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Wait. Is that... one of the flyers they made?
(Observe a flyer on the stones)
Arataki Gang Flyer: (The contents of this flyer has been stomped on by at least several pairs of feet...)
(Upon reaching the location)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914804 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: There they are!

Gang Bylaws, Article 3[]

(Approach the location)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 kaito 01.ogg Kaito: You little brat! Where are the supplies? What did you do with them?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 akira 01.ogg Akira: Um, I think they probably ended up... in the sea?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 kaito 02.ogg Kaito: You idiot! You've ruined everything... Ugh, and you've stuck these hideous flyers all over the box!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 kaito 03.ogg Kaito: What do you take us for, huh?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 akira 02.ogg Akira: Nothing! I mean, I didn't mean anything...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 kaito 04.ogg Kaito: Our deal can't go ahead now... You are going to pay for this!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 akira 03.ogg Akira: Ah! W—Wait, you'd better not mess with me! I'm, I'm from the Arataki Gang!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 kaito 05.ogg Kaito: ...Come again?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 akira 04.ogg Akira: The Arataki Gang!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 kaito 06.ogg Kaito: Never heard of it!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 akira 05.ogg Akira: You don't wanna get on the wrong side of my boss! Even the general of the Shogun's Army doesn't dare to challenge him!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 akira 06.ogg Akira: And Shinobu, too! She's got connections all over Inazuma and Liyue! And... and...
 And me.
 And (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 akira 07.ogg Akira: You're here, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! And Shinobu!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 kaito 07.ogg Kaito: Hmph, so you're this Shinobu he's talking about, huh? Well, I don't know if I believe a word this little brat says...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 kaito 08.ogg Kaito: So tell me this — if you're really such a bigshot, why do you hang out with this nobody?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: In the Arataki Gang... nobody's a nobody.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Listen and learn. Gang Bylaws, Article 3: When one of us is in trouble, all of us come to their aid.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 akira 08.ogg Akira: Bylaws...? Do we even have those?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: We do now.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 kaito 09.ogg Kaito: Hmph, you asked for it!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914805 akira 09.ogg Akira: Shinobu, watch out!
(After defeating Kairagi)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914806 skirmisher 01.ogg Fatui Skirmisher: Hehe, hand over the supplies!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914806 skirmisher 02.ogg Fatui Skirmisher: Hmm? What the... Who are you!?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914806 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Akira, what have you gotten us into?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914806 akira 01.ogg Akira: I—I didn't know they were gonna give them to the Fatui!

(After defeating Fatui)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914807 akira 01.ogg Akira: *panting*... I thought I was a goner for sure...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914807 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: So these Kairagi were just pawns of the Fatui. Didn't see that coming.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914807 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: If we pass this information to the Tenryou Commission, it might go a long way towards making up for our past crimes.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914807 akira 02.ogg Akira: Huh? Shinobu, you mean...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914807 akira 03.ogg Akira: I did something good this time?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914807 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Hmph... In terms of the result, yes.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914807 akira 04.ogg Akira: Phew, that was a close call...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914807 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: However...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914807 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: In terms of the process — you're a member of the Arataki Gang and you're out of breath just from fighting a handful of Kairagi and Fatui...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914807 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Making up for our past crimes is one thing. But you really need some more hands-on training...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914807 akira 05.ogg Akira: Sh—Shinobu? Shinobu, no... (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! Help!

Fragrance of Wine[]

Media:vo kycop001 1909601 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: You made it. C'mon, let's go inside.
Media:vo kycop001 1909601 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Brace yourself for some sour grapes... Heh.
(After teleporting into the Dawn Winery)
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: If you're not feeling well, then let me go this time.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 elzer 01.ogg Elzer: Oh, I'm fine, it's not serious...
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Oh, I'm sorry, I hope I'm not interrupting anything important...
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: What're you doing here today? And I see you've brought a plus one...
 Greetings.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Oh, it's nothing particularly pressing. It's just that we recently returned from Sumeru, and given how long it's been since we last visited the Winery, we thought we'd drop by and say hello.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Is that it? Make yourselves comfortable, then.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Oh, do you really mean that? Because my definition of "comfortable" happens to involve prodigious amounts of your finest wines... Speaking of which, I'm curious where you store the wine these days — is it the same place as it always used to be?
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: Sounds like you're in a hurry to reach your goal. Been plotting this raid for a long time?
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Plotting a raid? Why, you misunderstand me. The truth is, a rumor happened to reach my ears recently...
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: My informants tell me that last month, the Dawn Winery spent a large sum of Mora on two bottles of limited-edition Northland Valberry Liquor. However, it turns out that they are likely just cheap knockoffs masquerading as the real thing!
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Of course, a teetotaler like yourself would struggle to tell the difference. So why not get a connoisseur to help you appraise the quality?
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Ah wait — but the sterling reputation of Dawn Winery is at stake! Why, if you really purchased bootleg liquor, that would be scandalous. Better to have unknown and insignificant alcohol aficionados do the taste-test for you, to prevent word getting out.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: Quite the story. You used that one last year. Got anything else?
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: What, really? Uhhh... I totally forgot. Hmmm... in that case, how about the principle of reciprocity?
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Here, this is for you. I bought it for you in Sumeru, and it cost a veritable mountain of Mora.

Media:vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: Thanks. Put it on the table.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: That's it? No comment whatsoever?
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 07.ogg Diluc: You want a comment? Okay then. This thing is very in line with your unique aesthetic tastes, much like that vase over there.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 08.ogg Diluc: Elzer, fetch a bottle of this year's newest batch from the warehouse. Or else someone will keep blathering on with endless excuses.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 elzer 02.ogg Elzer: One moment, Master Kaeya, I shall fetch it immediately... *cough* *cough*
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: What's wrong, Elzer? Are you okay?
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 elzer 03.ogg Elzer: My throat is a bit raspy is all. It got better after I began taking medicine, but recently... *cough* ...It flared up again. Other than a bit of difficulty breathing now and then, it's nothing to be concerned about.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Many illnesses are caused by overwork. If you don't get enough rest, medicine alone won't solve the problem.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: Surely, you should've long since handed over the work of the winery to Diluc by now? You can't keep being Diluc's butler, he's becoming a louse.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 elzer 04.ogg Elzer: Actually, most of the time he... *cough* ...
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 09.ogg Diluc: Take some time off, Elzer. Don't put it off any longer. I'll handle the guild matters.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 10.ogg Diluc: It's important to take care of your health. You have to take it seriously. And Cavalry Captain... you would do well to remember that brevity is the soul of wit.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 elzer 05.ogg Elzer: Master Diluc, Master Kaeya, thank you both. *cough* ... Then I'll take my leave and rest for a few days...
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: Enjoy your vacation! Though before you officially clock out, let me head out the door with you. We can grab a few bottles on the way.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: There's nothing quite like enjoying a quality wine while feeling the gentle breeze against your face... ahh.
 Want to come, Diluc?
 We can drink inside together.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 11.ogg Diluc: Normally I'd accompany you, but unfortunately I still have some pressing matters to take care of. My apologies and regards to both of you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: Really? That's a shame.
(Talk to Diluc again, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 12.ogg Diluc: Where's Kaeya? Gone already?
 Kaeya's still here. What're you working on?
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 13.ogg Diluc: Right now, just the usual day-to-day winery business. But I'll be attending a meeting in Elzer's place shortly.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 14.ogg Diluc: The meeting concerns research and development of new beverages, and involves collaboration between several different wineries. It makes more sense for me to attend, anyway.
Media:vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 15.ogg Diluc: Kaeya can answer any questions you might have while I'm not here. He's quite familiar with the winery.
(After going outside)
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 elzer 01.ogg Elzer: I asked Connor to select a bottle of our best. He'll bring it by shortly.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: You asked Connor?
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 elzer 02.ogg Elzer: Haha, he hasn't seen you in a while. He's just happy to be able to do this for you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Considerate as ever. Ah, Elzer! I also brought you a gift. Here, this belt buckle is for you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 elzer 03.ogg Elzer: Such artistry... Thank you very much indeed. I'll put it on as soon as I get home.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Glad you like it. Go on, enjoy your time off, and don't forget to see a doctor!
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 elzer 04.ogg Elzer: Very well, Master Kaeya. I'll be taking my leave now.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Elzer is a good guy, and he's very responsible. But with a thousand different things to worry about each day, that same sense of responsibility wears him down.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 01.ogg Connor: Master Kaeya, your wine, and an Apple Cider for your friend! All freshly fermented this year. Please, have a taste!
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 02.ogg Connor: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), this one's for you.
 Thank you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Very clear... and a full-bodied aroma. It's rather nice.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 03.ogg Connor: Isn't it? This one's a little on the sweeter side, but I can go grab a dry one if you'd prefer!
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: No need, sweet is just fine. Let's drink one together.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 04.ogg Connor: Don't mind if I do, haha! I haven't caught up with you like this in a long time.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 05.ogg Connor: We used to always pour the first glass for you when cracking open a new barrel. With you gone these past few years, I've had to drink it for you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Well, since it wasn't me harvesting the grapes, destemming, or crushing them, it's much more fitting that you should take the first taste.
 Destemming?
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 06.ogg Connor: It's an important step in the winemaking process. After harvesting the grapes, the stems have to be removed prior to fermentation, or they'll affect the quality.
 Crushing?
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 07.ogg Connor: Crushing the grapes improves the aroma and color of the wine during the fermentation process. If you're curious to learn more about the winemaking process, you can read our "Fruit Wine Maker's Manual."
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 08.ogg Connor: If you'd like, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), you can help us harvest some grapes. Winemaking can be quite a lot of fun.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: It isn't nearly as exciting as he makes it sound. Your back will be in so much pain after picking grapes that you won't be able to stand up straight.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 09.ogg Connor: Master Kaeya is right, harvesting grapes is backbreaking labor.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 10.ogg Connor: But seeing the grapes turn into grape juice, then ferment into wine, it's a fascinating experience, and every person at the winery should have a chance to share in it.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Wait, so Diluc actually helps you with the winemaking?
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 11.ogg Connor: Goodness, no, Master Diluc is far too busy! Not just during the day, but even at night...
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: Oh? And just what is Diluc always so busy with?
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 12.ogg Connor: Well, you know. Come nightfall, he's always out there... Uh, networking, and so on... Heh, Master Kaeya, you may be surprised to learn just what lengths Master Diluc is willing to go to for the sake of the business...
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Haha, Connor, you're an awful liar. I hate to see you struggle.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 13.ogg Connor: Um... Hehe, so — Master Kaeya, how do you like your drink? I remember you weren't very interested in wine when you were young.
 (That was the least natural segue in conversational history.)
 (Connor almost exposed the Darknight Hero...)
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: ...That was because the adults said children weren't allowed even a drop. Don't you remember how much trouble Diluc got in that time he snuck a drink?
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 14.ogg Connor: Ahhh, yes, of course! Adelinde even covered for the two of you, haha!
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: But on a serious note, having grown up at a winery, I spent my childhood watching Tunner plant the grapeseeds, waiting for them to ripen on the vine, harvesting them together, and waiting for the alcohol to ferment.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: Even though I couldn't help with making distilled spirits, watching everyone work was fascinating.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: How could anyone not love to drink with a childhood like that?
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: So, let us raise a glass to wine itself, and in thanks to the gracious hospitality the winery has shown us today!
 To our generous hosts!
 Though my drink is non-alcoholic...
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 15.ogg Connor: Hear, hear! To Dawn Winery!
Three glasses clink, and are promptly drained in celebration.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 17.ogg Kaeya: Speaking of wine, Connor, I have a gift for you. It's a decanter set from Sumeru.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 16.ogg Connor: I get a present too? Thank you, Master Kaeya.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 17.ogg Connor: Time really does fly! I still remember the days when everyone was giving you gifts at your birthday parties when you were young.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 18.ogg Connor: Now, I have wrinkles and Tunner's bent double, while Master Kaeya is the Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius!
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 18.ogg Kaeya: How is Tunner holding up?
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 19.ogg Connor: He's still tough, but getting on in years, so some things just aren't as easy as they were. But he's used to doing things his way, and doesn't trust new employees to do it for him.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 20.ogg Connor: A lot of the temporary workers I hired quit because they couldn't handle how picky he was.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 21.ogg Connor: Master Kaeya, if you have time, why not go talk to him about it? You're probably the only person he'll listen to besides Master Diluc.
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 19.ogg Kaeya: I definitely owe him a visit. I haven't seen him in some time, and I do have fond memories of the days when he was teaching me to pick grapes...
(Talk to Connor again, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909604 connor 22.ogg Connor: The art of winemaking is fascinating, would you like to try and learn?
Winery Work[]
(Talk to Tunner)
Media:vo kycop001 1909605 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Busy day today, Tunner?
Media:vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 01.ogg Tunner: Oh, Master Kaeya, you're back! No, I'm not at all busy, I just spend my hours watching the grapes growing on the vine.
Media:vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 02.ogg Tunner: They're growing wonderfully this year. A few rows are almost ripe! We've already begun harvesting them these past few days, so that'll keep me occupied.
Media:vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 03.ogg Tunner: Sit, sit! After we're done picking, I'll bring a few bunches over for you to try.
Media:vo kycop001 1909605 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: No need. We were just drinking with Connor, and our stomachs are so full of wine that we couldn't eat a bite.
Media:vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 04a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 04b.ogg Tunner: What about your friend? Doesn't (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍) want to try?
 I'm not hungry.
 Thank you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909605 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Allow me to introduce the Honorary Knight of the Knights of Favonius, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 05.ogg Tunner: Ah, the Honorary Knight in the flesh! There are so many talented people in the Knights of Favonius. You all have bright futures ahead of you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909605 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Harvesting grapes is hard work, let me help you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909605 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Do you still remember how I used to help out when we were shorthanded?
Media:vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 06.ogg Tunner: Haha, I believe I do... In that case, I'm counting on you!
 I will help too.
Media:vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 07.ogg Tunner: What's this, everyone's clamoring to do manual labor? Well, suits me! More help is always appreciated.
Media:vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 08a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 08b.ogg Tunner: Come with me, (‍young ladyoung ladText for male Traveler/young lassyoung lassText for female Traveler‍). I'll tell you which grapes are ripe enough, and you can pick them.
(Talk to Tunner again, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909606 tunner 01.ogg Tunner: Happy to have another helper. Now, let's go pick some grapes!
(Talk to Kaeya, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909606 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Winery rules state that whoever picks the most grapes without damaging them gets to drink the first glass from the new batch.
(After picking two bunches of Ripe Grapes and following Tunner)
Media:vo kycop001 1909606 tunner 02a.ogg Media:vo kycop001 1909606 tunner 02b.ogg Tunner: You have nimble hands, (‍ladladText for male Traveler/lassielassieText for female Traveler‍)! Master Kaeya wasn't nearly so careful when he was young. He mangled so many his first time, tsk tsk... what a waste!
Media:vo kycop001 1909606 tunner 03.ogg Tunner: Fortunately, the young master has a good head on his shoulders. Didn't take long for him to get up to speed.
Media:vo kycop001 1909606 tunner 04.ogg Tunner: And now he's turned into such an outstanding young man. Polite and kind...
Media:vo kycop001 1909606 tunner 05.ogg Tunner: If I had a son as exceptional as Kaeya, I would be the happiest man in Mondstadt!
(After picking two more bunches of grapes)
Media:vo kycop001 1909607 tunner 01.ogg Tunner: There's a few more rows of grapes up ahead. Let's finish picking them together.
Media:vo kycop001 1909607 tunner 02.ogg Tunner: Careful not to damage the grapes when you pinch the stem.
(After picking one more bunch of grapes)
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 01.ogg Tunner: These grapes look excellent, you're a fast learner.
(Talk to Tunner)
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 02.ogg Tunner: I'll take them, good job.
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 03.ogg Tunner: Master Kaeya left the winery and moved to Mondstadt... just like my own son, Guy. He left home to join the Knights of Favonius, too.
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 04.ogg Tunner: I don't know him like Miss Adelinde or Master Diluc do, but I know that no matter how old your child gets, they always need a home they can come back to.
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 05.ogg Tunner: And without family by your side, you at least need the companionship of friends.
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 06.ogg Tunner: I've been working here for decades, and watched him grow up with my own two eyes... Sometimes, I get the sense that there is something bothering him. Something deep-rooted.
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 07.ogg Tunner: But he guards his secrets closely. Or perhaps he just doesn't want to involve us... After all, I doubt that we could help him.
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 08.ogg Tunner: I can see that you have a good relationship with Master Kaeya. Please look after him... He's very dear to us.
 I'll take good care of him.
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 09.ogg Tunner: Hearing that puts my mind at ease. You're a good child. Thank you.
 Kaeya is an important friend to me.
 I think Kaeya is much stronger than you might imagine.
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 10.ogg Tunner: ...That he is, yes. I do still think of him as a child. It takes time for an old man's mind to adjust.
 Kaeya is an important friend to me.
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 11.ogg Tunner: Wonderful, wonderful. Knowing that he has a friend like you, we here at the winery can be happy for him.
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: You're looking very happy, Tunner. Was (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) telling you some jokes?
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 12.ogg Tunner: Haha, no, no jokes... I've received a letter from my son, Guy. He's really going places. I'm so delighted!
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 13.ogg Tunner: Master Kaeya, Honorary Knight, my eyesight is fading in my old age... Could you read it out for me?
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Of course!
Media:vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 14.ogg Tunner: Thank you both.

Dialogue[]
Further Investigation[]

 Quest DescriptionYou should be able to make progress with the information you have gathered so far...
(Go over the clues with Layla)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915302 layla 02.ogg Layla: Okay, everyone's given us a lot of useful information. Let's go through it and try to organize everything.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915302 layla 03.ogg Layla: Some things we heard were pretty straightforward, but others were just ridiculous...
 We should be able to figure out more about its identity and whereabouts.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915302 layla 04.ogg Layla: Yeah, let me think and see what I can make of it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915302 layla 05.ogg Layla: (Okay, calm down Layla. I know the info's all over the place, but you can definitely do it.)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915302 layla 06.ogg Layla: (First, let's try to figure out the Seelie's identity based on the clues we currently have.)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915302 layla 07.ogg Layla: (Then, we'll analyze where it's been sighted and its motives... Finally, we'll piece everything together...)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915302 layla 08.ogg Layla: (From there, we should be able to predict its movement. Alright, let's give it a try.)

(Layla enters Contemplation)
(Interpret - Book Checkout Logs)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915302 layla 09.ogg Layla: (Book circulation is strictly regulated and there is a log of anyone who checks out a book.)
(Interpret - Shadow That Infiltrated the House of Daena)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915302 layla 10.ogg Layla: (It once infiltrated the House of Daena while it was closed.)
(Interpret - The Wisdom Seelie's Superpower)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915302 layla 11.ogg Layla: (Hmm, I think I heard somewhere that it has a lot of ridiculous abilities...)
(Interpret - Sighting Location)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915302 layla 12.ogg Layla: (It's been to the Chatrakam Cave, the Avidya Forest, and the waterfall south of Sumeru City.)
(Interpret - The Wisdom Seelie's True Identity)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915302 layla 13.ogg Layla: (The stamp... Hmm, which probably means they're a Rtawahist student...)
(Submit the wrong conclusion)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915302 layla 14.ogg Layla: (I may be able to come up with a more concrete lead if I keep thinking...)
(Submit the wrong association)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915302 layla 15.ogg Layla: (Hmm, no, there doesn't seem to be any notable connection between these two pieces of information.)
(Quit Contemplation and use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Layla, optional)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915302 layla 01.ogg Layla: (Hmm... I think it's slowly starting to come together now...)
(Submitting the correct association - The Wisdom Seelie's True Identity to Sighting Location)
(Submit - The Wisdom Seelie's Behavioral Logic)

Media:vo lylcop001 1915303 layla 01.ogg Layla: Okay, I think I've got it now...
 So, what've you come up with?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915303 layla 02.ogg Layla: First, based on the information Katayoun provided, we can assume that the Seelie is a student from the Rtawahist Darshan.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915303 layla 03.ogg Layla: The possibility of it being someone outside the Darshan can be ruled out because it'd be impossible to gain access to those two books without going through the librarian.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915303 layla 04.ogg Layla: Next, leaving its crazy abilities aside, all the sightings took place in locations that are officially recommended for astrology observation by the Akademiya.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915303 layla 05.ogg Layla: In other words, it's probably just conducting research, and the nature of its research is very similar to mine.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915303 layla 06.ogg Layla: The question that I submitted was no simple query, but it was able to give me a reply in just a day. This implies that it's familiar with a similar field of knowledge.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915303 layla 07.ogg Layla: So, based on this reasoning, all we have to do is wait for it at the next astrological observation site.
 Your reasoning is solid.
 Look at you, finishing your thesis should be no problem at all.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915303 layla 08.ogg Layla: Ah, uh... It's nothing, really. There are actually some other factors that I've been speculating about...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915303 layla 09.ogg Layla: But that's not important right now, let's get going. Even though we have a lead, it's still hard to say whether we'll be able to make any discoveries.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915303 layla 10.ogg Layla: I'll tell you what I mean by that if the Seelie doesn't show up...
(Continue to The Truth Behind "It")

The Truth Behind "It"[]

(If the watchtower is still locked)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915303 layla 11.ogg Layla: We should be able to see more from up above, but how do we get up there?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915303 layla 12.ogg Layla: Let's try using the Elemental Monuments in the area.
(Upon Arriving to the watchtower)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 01.ogg Layla: The weather today is perfect for observation. Let's see if it shows up.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 02.ogg Layla: Honestly, spending an entire night waiting for something that we're not sure is gonna happen might not be the best use of our time...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 03.ogg Layla: But we don't really have any choice. This is all we've got.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 04.ogg Layla: Get some sleep if you're tired. I'll be up, it's not like I can sleep anyways.
 I'll stay up with you.
 I'm afraid you'll get bored.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 05.ogg Layla: Thanks. Hmm... Oh, how about I share some basics about astrology with you? If you're interested, that is.
(The time passes as the two of you chat.)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 06.ogg Layla: Sure enough, it didn't show up.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 07.ogg Layla: We hardly saw any animals, let alone people.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 08.ogg Layla: No matter how conclusive the evidence is or how perfect our reasoning may be, nothing will happen as long as I'm awake.
 Are you referring to the... "Wisdom Seelie" or the "blessing from the stars"?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 09.ogg Layla: They're probably one and the same.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 10.ogg Layla: It's like I told you — I have a severe sleeping disorder... and there have been a lot of rumors about me sleepwalking.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 11.ogg Layla: I tried to understand what I had been doing when I'm unconscious, but I've never been able to get any definitive evidence.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 12.ogg Layla: Something is actively attempting to cover up all the clues without my knowing.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 13.ogg Layla: Maybe that "something" is me... or maybe it isn't... I can't be sure...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 14.ogg Layla: For all I know, I could even BE the Seelie. But... what if I am?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 15.ogg Layla: Would "the Seelie" be willing to help me this time? What is it actually thinking? I really have no idea...
 What if I could help you?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 16.ogg Layla: Huh? You want to help me?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 17.ogg Layla: Of course, it would be nice to know what's really going on...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 18.ogg Layla: But that's impossible. It's always avoiding me and keeping me in the dark... And that won't change, even if you're around.
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Seeing how badly she wants to know, maybe we should find a way to ask the "other Layla" about it...)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 19.ogg Layla: Huh? What's wrong?
 Oh, nothing. Maybe there really isn't anything we can do.
 Seems like we've come up empty-handed again this time.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 20.ogg Layla: Yeah...
(Stress Value +1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 21.ogg Layla: *sigh* And to think I could've been working on my thesis this whole time... Ahh, my stomach is churning just thinking about it...
 You're really not going to finish on time now.
 There's nothing else I can do. I'm sorry.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 22.ogg Layla: Please stop... the more you talk about it, the more silly I feel...
(Stress Value +1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 23.ogg Layla: Oh, c'mon Layla, what are you doing? Everyone's gonna start thinking you're crazy now...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 24.ogg Layla: Ahh... oh no. I'm losing it... So dizzy... ugh...
 (I'm sorry to have to make you feel so uncomfortable.)
(Stress Value +1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 25.ogg Layla: Hmm... oh, I'm sorry, I got distracted there. Where were we?
 (It seems like she's completely recovered. Huh, does that mean...)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 26.ogg Layla: Oh, what's wrong? You look like you've got something on your mind.
 Are you... the other Layla?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 27.ogg Layla: Hmm? What are you talking about? What do you mean the "other" Layla...? I am Layla.
 But you somehow seem a little different.
 Then why don't you repeat the conversation we just had?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 28.ogg Layla: *sigh*
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 29.ogg Layla: Fine. It appears that you were waiting for me to show up. I suppose there's no use in me pretending.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 30.ogg Layla: I promise I don't mean any harm, and I'll answer all your questions. But before that, would you mind telling me who you are first?
 I'm a friend of Layla's. I'm trying to help her finish her thesis.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 31.ogg Layla: Let me think... Okay, I got it. You two found this place by following the hints that I left behind. You were planning to wait for me... Or, I should say, you were waiting for the Seelie to show up.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 32.ogg Layla: Was this your idea or hers?
 Mostly hers.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 33.ogg Layla: I see. Yes, she's always had great analytical skills. It'd be nice if she was more confident, though.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 34.ogg Layla: Alright, that's all the questions I have. Your turn, please ask away.
 Did you infiltrate the House of Daena? And what about those rumors of special powers?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 41.ogg Layla: Infiltrating the House of Daena was a total accident. She'd forgotten an important book, and the House of Daena happened to be closed at the time. There were only days before the paper was due.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 42.ogg Layla: I had no choice but to scale the walls with some simple climbing ropes and sneak in from above while the Corps of Thirty wasn't paying attention.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 43.ogg Layla: I had no idea there was still a student inside. I had no choice but to put him to sleep.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 44.ogg Layla: Any clear evidence of my existence would only hinder my ability to conceal my identity. It would also expose me to Layla as well.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 45.ogg Layla: As for the special powers... Well, they're just things I did during the process of trying to finish the thesis. It's like I said — I don't have much time, so I need to be as efficient as possible.
 What's with the Seelie pranking people?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 38.ogg Layla: I can instantly tell which students are asking serious questions and which are just trying to take advantage of me to slack off.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 39.ogg Layla: My time to move freely is quite limited, so it's only natural that I would punish the people attempting to waste my time.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 40.ogg Layla: My intention is to help people. I'm not here to cause any harm.
 You're the Seelie, aren't you?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 35.ogg Layla: That's right... Though I didn't intend for it to turn out this way, really. I just wanted to help out a few other classmates who were having a hard time while I was helping Layla finish her thesis.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 36.ogg Layla: You see, Layla doesn't have many friends at the Akademiya. If the others noticed her helping them out, I thought maybe I'd help her become more sociable.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 37.ogg Layla: Unfortunately, that didn't really work out. Instead, legends of "the Seelie" started going around. Hehe, but that's alright.
(After all question is depeleted)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 46.ogg Layla: Well then, does that answer all your questions?
 Actually, I have one last question.
 Why don't you want her to know you exist?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 47.ogg Layla: Ah, you see... her emotions are incredibly unstable. She's constantly doubting herself.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 48.ogg Layla: If she knew that there's another Layla who is capable of doing everything, she may think even less of herself.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 49.ogg Layla: She could think, "Maybe I should just leave it all to her. I'm always relying on her anyway. Why not let her live my life for me...?"
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 50.ogg Layla: She might start thinking about giving up completely, and that's the exact opposite of what I'm trying to do for her.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 51.ogg Layla: After all, she and I are one and the same. We're two sides of the same coin.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 52.ogg Layla: No one knows her greatest strength more than I do — it's her resilience. If she's able to persevere in everything she does, then one day, she won't need my help anymore.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 53.ogg Layla: I trust that she's capable of doing that, and it's something that she should do on her own.
 I see.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 54.ogg Layla: She actually discovered the key data she needs for her thesis a long time ago. She just didn't organize it well enough. I'll complete her thesis for her, just as I have in the past.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 55.ogg Layla: Please don't share any of this with her. I would like to keep this a secret, for both of our sakes.
 I understand.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 56.ogg Layla: Thank you for doing this for me... no, for us.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 57.ogg Layla: She seems to be waking up now. Well, this is goodbye. If we never meet again, then... I guess I did something right, hehe.
(Stress Value −1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 58.ogg Layla: Ugh... Mmm...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 59.ogg Layla: Huh? Did I... did I faint? Or did I fall asleep?
 You're fine. You just had a little nap.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 60.ogg Layla: Oh, I see. Was I sleepwalking? I was, wasn't I?
 Nope.
 Nah, not really.
 I don't think so.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 61.ogg Layla: Really?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 62.ogg Layla: I don't believe you... You're hiding something from me, it's written all over your face.
 I'm not, really.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 63.ogg Layla: You said you were gonna help me, didn't you? Why are you holding out on me now?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915306 layla 64.ogg Layla: Please, tell me! You promised you'd help.

His Ideas[]

(Walk with Kaeya)
Media:vo kycop001 1907902 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: The rules of the Knights of Favonius state that any and all expenditures during a business trip are counted as "travel expenses." That's more than enough justification to live a little.
Media:vo kycop001 1907902 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Of course, with me being here on my own, it was looking like a wasted opportunity.
Media:vo kycop001 1907902 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: But now that I've run into you, why don't we make this a joint trip?
Reunion[]
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: You're always so busy, it's high time you gave yourself a proper break. Even the sharpest blade loses its edge if it's always in use. Regular maintenance is essential for reliable performance.
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: And anyway, life is short, so we should make the most of the time we have. Right now is the perfect time to relax and enjoy ourselves, and who knows how many other chances we'll get. So come on, what do you say?
 We can't spend public money for our own amusement. (This dialogue option leads to Memento.)
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Hehe, now I remember why you're an honorary knight. Of course being tempted by money is beneath you.
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Your honest character is dazzling to behold — like the sunlight reflecting off the surface of Cider Lake in the late fall... I hold my hands up: My thinking was mistaken.
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: In that case, I guess today's end-of-trip blowout is canceled. I shall pack my luggage and prepare to return to Mondstadt.
 I can join you for the journey.
 It'll be nice to catch up with everyone in Mondstadt anyway.
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Oh? You'd do that for me? Well, this wasn't what I'd originally planned, but it's a very welcome development.
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: When I was souvenir shopping, I picked out something for you, too. Guess my thoughtfulness wasn't in vain.
 You got me a souvenir?
 Ooh, what did you get me?
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Let's keep that a secret for now. Not because I want to keep you guessing...
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: It's just that I didn't think I'd run into you here. All my gifts are back at the inn.
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: I want you to find out for yourself when you open it. The surprise is what gift-giving is all about, is it not?
 Fine.
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Then it's settled. We'll leave together shortly.
 Let me take you somewhere new. (This dialogue option leads to Feathers Adrift in a Spring Breeze.)
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Great, music to my ears. I'll cover the travel costs of course.
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: There's nothing more enjoyable than the company of a good friend. Let's call this a nice little excursion to round off my long business trip.
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: Now, let me think where we should go. Hmm... I've seen a lot of Sumeru already, so let's go for someplace new.
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: How about Liyue? I'd be heading past there on my way back to Mondstadt anyway, so it's not out of the way.
 I know Liyue inside and out.
 No problem, I'll show you around.
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: Haha, well lucky me! I'll hold you to that.
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 17.ogg Kaeya: Liyue's Ministry of Civil Affairs frequently corresponds with the Knights of Favonius, so the address on their letterhead is one of the few places I'm familiar with.
Media:vo kycop001 1907903 kaeya 18.ogg Kaeya: I don't have much luggage, so it won't take me long to pack. Give me a moment, and then we'll head there together.

Exchanging Pointers[]

(Talk to Diona in Dawn Winery)
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 01.ogg Connor: Oh, you're here. Look, I've already prepared all the tools we need.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 02.ogg Connor: Sure, they're a little... basic, but they should do just fine. I've also prepared a top-shelf bottle of Dandelion Wine to use as a drink base.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 03.ogg Connor: Oh, I've also heard that you don't like to see people drink too much, am I right?
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 04.ogg Connor: So today, we'll strictly just exchange techniques. There will be no talk of drinking, and even if we try the drinks, we'll just only have a little taste. How's that sound?
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 diona 01.ogg Diona: Fine, I suppose. These tools will suffice.
 How did you prepare so many things in advance?
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 05.ogg Connor: Ah, heh... Well, we've always been hoping to invite Diona to our winery to instruct us on her techniques of mixing drinks.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 06.ogg Connor: Though the preparations have been made, we've just never had the chance...
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 07.ogg Connor: So how could I not be fully prepared now that she's willing to come today!
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 08.ogg Connor: Oh, and to keep things fair, we'll need an impartial judge...
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 diona 02a.ogg Diona: Well, we have the Honorary Knight...
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 09a.ogg Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 09b.ogg Connor: Yes, but (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍) doesn't look...
 I don't look to be of drinking age yet. Yes, I know...
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 10.ogg Connor: Haha, so honest and forthcoming, you are after all the Honorary Knight of the Knights of Favonius. What impressive discipline!
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 11.ogg Connor: Hmm... then who could we find to be the judge?
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 elzer 01.ogg Elzer: Connor, there you are. I've been looking for you, what are you doing here?
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 12.ogg Connor: Elzer, your timing couldn't be any more perfect. I'm about to have a little mixing competition with Diona here...
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 elzer 02.ogg Elzer: What! Really!? That's great! Would it be alright if I stayed to observe?
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 13.ogg Connor: Actually, we're looking for a judge. Would you be free to help us out?
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 elzer 03.ogg Elzer: Haha, why I'd be delighted! It'd be an honor to have an opportunity to have a taste of Diona's craft.
 (What a... coincidence.)
 (These two have been planning this all along.)
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 diona 03.ogg Diona: What's that old booze sponge Elzer doing here? He doesn't think that I'm here to collaborate with them, does he?
 Collaborate with them?
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 diona 04.ogg Diona: Don't you know? Elzer used to always show up at the Cat's Tail.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 diona 05.ogg Diona: Every time he came, he would always be sweet-talking me, trying to get me to work with the Dawn Winery to come up with some sort of new drink.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 diona 06.ogg Diona: He needs to know that that'll never happen, not until I figure out how to make the most terrible drink in the world.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 14.ogg Connor: Uh, so then... Shall we begin Diona?
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 diona 07.ogg Diona: Sure, but like I said before, this is an exchange of techniques as bartenders. Anyone not involved should stay away.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 elzer 04.ogg Elzer: What is that supposed to mean?
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 15.ogg Connor: Um, Elzer... why don't you just take a break over there? We'll bring over the drinks once they're finished.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 elzer 05.ogg Elzer: Wait, but I...
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 16.ogg Connor: Elzer, just...
 (Their faces are gonna cramp up with all the facial cues they're giving each other...)
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 elzer 06.ogg Elzer: Ah... right! I shouldn't disturb the mixing process. I'll uh... be over there, just let me know if you need me.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 17.ogg Connor: Alright, since I invited you here, I'll begin.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 18.ogg Connor: Lizard Tail's bitter nature will ruin the alcohol's texture and taste. We should soak it in distilled spirits first to remove the bitterness, then add it to the Dandelion Wine later as flavoring...
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 19.ogg Connor: Hmm... Slime Condensate in small amounts could improve the texture, but not too much, otherwise the alcohol might start to coagulate.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 20.ogg Connor: The smell of these Fish Scales is way too strong, there's no way it could go in a drink. And is Butterfly Dust even edible?
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 21.ogg Connor: Oh well, let's start mixing and see what we end up with...
Connor speeds up his mixing process...
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 22.ogg Connor: And voilá, it's done. Elzer, if you could please do the honors.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 elzer 07.ogg Elzer: Ahem... the color and presentation... Hmm, it looks very interesting. Let me have a try...
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 elzer 08.ogg Elzer: Mmm, upon an initial taste, the impact of the distilled spirits mixed with the refreshing Dandelion Wine along with a hint of bitterness all work to accentuate the distinct flavor of the drink.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 elzer 09.ogg Elzer: And this slightly thicker texture... Hmm, it really is a memorable drink.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 elzer 10.ogg Elzer: Yes, not bad Connor. Looks like you've finally found the right inspiration to guide your mixing techniques.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 23.ogg Connor: It's all thanks to Diona. If she hadn't asked for this little exchange of skills and provided all the ingredients, then I'd probably still be confined to my old techniques and usual ingredients.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 24.ogg Connor: However, I wasn't able to find a way to use the Butterfly Dust and Fish Scales. Seems that my creativity is still quite limited...
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 elzer 11.ogg Elzer: Hahaha, no worries. Not everyone possesses Diona's genius intuition and techniques. No need to be so hard on yourself.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 diona 08.ogg Diona: So he actually made something good out of these ingredients... Do you remember all the techniques he used?
 I tried to remember as much as I could.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 diona 09.ogg Diona: The process wasn't too complicated. Next, all we have to do is follow the same steps, but mess them all up.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 diona 10.ogg Diona: Alright, first you can try making a drink using the same techniques.
 Why don't you just make it?
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 diona 11.ogg Diona: Because observation and experimentation come first when a professional bartender is faced with a new mixing technique.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 diona 12.ogg Diona: As my assistant, you must try your best to make a horrible, terrible tasting drink. Meanwhile, I'll watch closely and see if there's any room for improvement.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 elzer 12.ogg Elzer: So, Diona's going to be making the next drink for us, right?
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 connor 25.ogg Connor: I just can't wait to see what she'll be making!
 (It's like they're finishing each other's sentences...)
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 diona 13a.ogg Media:vo dancop001 1910701 diona 13b.ogg Diona: Sure, but before I do, let's allow my assistant to have a try. (‍HeHeText for male Traveler/SheSheText for female Traveler‍)'s also very interested in mixing drinks.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 elzer 13a.ogg Media:vo dancop001 1910701 elzer 13b.ogg Elzer: Is (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍) a bartender as well? Ooh, aren't we lucky! We're in for a treat.
Media:vo dancop001 1910701 elzer 14.ogg Elzer: Please, this way. All the materials and tools are already prepared, you may start when you're ready.
(Talk to Connor and Elzer)
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 elzer 01.ogg Elzer: Great job, keep it up. We'll definitely be able to hire Diona as resident bartender here!
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 connor 01.ogg Connor: I hope it works. I was out there for weeks waiting for this chance... We musn't let this opportunity go to waste.
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 elzer 02.ogg Elzer: You really outdid yourself this time, Connor. As long as we can get Diona to come work here, all our hard work will have paid off. This is just the first step.
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 elzer 03.ogg Elzer: Now don't forget, Diona must feel our sincerity and our passion! Oh, and remember, try not to overdo it...
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 connor 02.ogg Connor: No problem. We've already gone over this many times before.
 What are you guys talking about?
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 elzer 04.ogg Elzer: Huh?! Oh, hehe... nothing. We're just uhh... just discussing some winery business matters, yeah... hahaha.
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 connor 03.ogg Connor: Y—Yeah, we're talking about business. Let's go over the recent upkeep costs of the winery again, shall we, Elzer?
(Talk to Diona)
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 diona 01.ogg Diona: Remember, do everything completely opposite to how Connor did. This is the only way we can reach my... I mean, our goal.
(Making the Cocktail)
Make Cocktail: (First, Connor soaked the Lizard Tail in the distilled alcohol, then he added the distilled alcohol into the Dandelion Wine. How do we mess this step up?)
 (Put the whole Lizard Tail directly into the Dandelion Wine.)
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 connor 04.ogg Connor: Huh, they added the whole Lizard Tail without distilling it... Is this some kind of new mixing technique?
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 diona 02.ogg Diona: Yes, nicely done, hehe. Just make everything a total mess.
 (Soak the Lizard Tail in the distilled alcohol, then add the distilled alcohol into the Dandelion Wine.) (−1 Heart)
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 diona 03.ogg Diona: Wha—!? I thought we agreed that we'd mess everything up. You're just repeating exactly what he did.
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 diona 04.ogg Diona: Here, let's just dump the Lizard Tail right into the drink, no need for any processing.
Make Cocktail: (Next, Connor added a very small portion of Slime Condensate into his drink. How do we mess this up?)
 (Add all of the Slime Condensate into the drink.)
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 diona 05.ogg Diona: That's it, that's it! Ooooh, this will definitely be the worst drink ever.
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 elzer 05.ogg Elzer: You put all of it in?! Wh—What kind of a drink is this?
 (Add just a small bit of Slime Condensate into the drink.) (−1 Heart)
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 diona 06.ogg Diona: Didn't you heard what I said? You have to mess up every single step.
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 diona 07.ogg Diona: Just add all of it, quickly! We don't want any leftovers!
Make Cocktail: (Finally, Connor didn't seem to add any of the Butterfly Dust and Fish Scales. How do we mess this up?)
 (Add all of the Butterfly Dust and Fish Scales to the drink.)
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 diona 08.ogg Diona: That's right, add all of it. This drink is just about ready!
 (Don't add the Butterfly Dust and Fish Scales to the drink.) (−1 Heart)
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 diona 09.ogg Diona: Wait, didn't I tell you!? You must mess up every step.
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 diona 10.ogg Diona: Quickly, just add everything! Yes, that should do it!
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 connor 05.ogg Connor: Alright Elzer, could you please do the honors for this one as well?
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 elzer 06.ogg Elzer: Ahem... Uh, on second thought Connor, I think you should taste this... unique drink.
Media:vo dancop001 1910702 elzer 07.ogg Elzer: Who knows, maybe you'll find some more inspiration for your mixing.
(Obtain  Some Strange... Drink?)
(Talk to Elzer and Connor)
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 connor 01.ogg Connor: Uh, but... is it even...
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 elzer 01.ogg Elzer: Connor, the most important thing right now is to show Diona our sincerity, understand?
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 connor 02.ogg Connor: Ah, understood!
(Talk to Diona)
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 diona 01.ogg Diona: Alright, are you done mixing the drink?
(After giving Diona the Cocktail)
Observe Cup: (The thick Slime Condensate has combined with the alcohol, while the Lizard Tail has expanded and is now floating at the top of the drink. The Butterfly Dust is scattered all over the place, and some Fish Scales have sunk to the bottom of the glass.)
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 connor 03.ogg Connor: I'm sorry, but this drink is way too, uh... creative for me. I'm afraid I couldn't stomach it.
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 elzer 02.ogg Elzer: Uh, yes, this drink is, uhh... very creative. Connor, I think you should taste it.
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 diona 02.ogg Diona: Looks like it worked! All we have to do is mess up every step of a professional mixing method, and we end up with an absolutely terrible drink.
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 diona 03.ogg Diona: Hehehe... Ahem, yes, this is a... splendid drink you've made. However, I'm afraid we can't serve it to customers like this! Ahem, here...
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 diona 04.ogg Diona: Hand me the drink. Let's keep the alcohol and dump all the other ingredients. I'll use that as a base to mix a new drink.
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 diona 05.ogg Diona: First, I'll chop the Lizard Tail into slices... then soak it in the drink. Next, add the Slime Condensate and stir, then leave it to settle for a bit. Finally, we sprinkle the Butterfly Dust and...
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 diona 06.ogg Diona: Oh wait, I almost forgot the Fish Scales! ...Okay, let's add it to the drink along with the mucus from the jar!
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 diona 07.ogg Diona: And then we stirrr... C'mon be dreadful, be awful, be absolutely disgusting!
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 connor 04.ogg Connor: Uh, Elzer... Diona is mixing a drink, right?
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 elzer 03.ogg Elzer: I've never seen such a technique before, but it is Diona, after all. She must have her own way... I suppose.
Diona speeds up her mixing process...
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 diona 08.ogg Diona: And... we're done! Hehehe, this specialty drink will be the first blow in tearing down the lies of the alcohol industry.
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 diona 09.ogg Diona: Please, have a taste. Come and realize your empty delusions of alcohol, hahahaha...
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 elzer 04.ogg Elzer: Wow! Th—This taste! Why, I've never had anything like it!
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 connor 05.ogg Connor: Let me try... Mmm, what a splendid drink! Though the bitterness of an entire Lizard Tail is quite potent, it is perfectly complemented by the refreshing and sour flavor of the Dandelion Wine.
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 connor 06.ogg Connor: In addition, the Fish Scales that were broken up during the stirring process have lost all their fishiness after soaking in the alcohol. The remaining flavor somehow enriches the taste of the drink.
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 connor 07.ogg Connor: The texture of all the Slime Condensate after fully absorbing all the alcohol has become rich and dynamic.
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 connor 08.ogg Connor: And lastly, the pinch of the Butterfly Dust adds a finishing touch that makes this drink perfect. It is sensational both visually and in taste! A true display of craftsmanship!
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 diona 10.ogg Diona: WH—WHAT!?
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 connor 09.ogg Connor: The drink I made earlier isn't even worth mentioning compared to this one! Ah, and I thought my drink was inspiring!
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 diona 11.ogg Diona: Stop joking around! You two must have drunk so much that your nose and tongue have lost their senses!
 Actually, this drink does smell pretty good.
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 diona 12.ogg Diona: Huh? Impossible! After all I've done! How is it that my drink still tastes great!? I must not have messed up enough somewhere...
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 diona 13.ogg Diona: Please, use this drink as your base and try making your drink again.
Media:vo dancop001 1910703 diona 14.ogg Diona: Whatever you do, just make it disgusting!
(Making the Cocktail)
Make Cocktail: (The goal this time is simply to make a terrible drink. According to Diona's method, the first step should be to put the entire Lizard Tail into the drink...)
 (Cut the Lizard Tail into slices, then put them into the drink.)
 (Put the entire Lizard Tail into the drink.)
Make Cocktail: (Next step, add a large amount of Slime Condensate, stir, and let settle...)
 (Add large amounts of Slime Condensate, stir, and let settle...)
 (Add a small amount of Slime Condensate, let settle, then stir...)
Make Cocktail: (Then, she sprinkled some Butterfly Dust on top...)
 (Sprinkle a pinch of Butterfly Dust.)
 (Pour a heap of Butterfly Dust.)
Make Cocktail: (Last step, add Fish Scales along with the mucus from the jar into the drink...)
 (Add Fish Scales and mucus into the drink.)
 (Crush the Fish Scales first, and then add it with the mucus into the drink.)
Observe Cup: (This should do it, let's show it to Diona...)
(Talk to Elzer and Connor)
Media:vo dancop001 1910706 elzer 01.ogg Elzer: Oh, are you... done? I'm very, uh... excited to taste your new work.
Media:vo dancop001 1910706 connor 01.ogg Connor: I wonder what kind of... surprise will be in store for us.
(Talking to Diona)
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 diona 01.ogg Diona: Yuck! Wh—What is this smell!? The pungent fish smell, sticky Slime Condensate, and spongy Lizard Tail... ew, not to mention the Butterfly Dust everywhere, blergh...
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 diona 03.ogg Diona: Though you didn't really follow the process we discussed, it seems that you've actually got quite a knack for this.
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 diona 04.ogg Diona: Alright, let's show this to Elzer and Connor!
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 elzer 01.ogg Elzer: Ooh, is this another one of Diona's new drinks?
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 elzer 02.ogg Elzer: AHH! Wh—What is this!? Even if you purposely tried to botch it, it'd still be hard to make something as hideous as this!
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 elzer 03.ogg Elzer: No, keep it away from me! Please. just take that somewhere else!
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 connor 01.ogg Connor: Huh, what's wrong? This is Diona's specialty drink, right? Let me try...
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 connor 02.ogg Connor: Ughh! You are Diona's assistant after all, your craft must be... ahead of the curve.
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 connor 03.ogg Connor: So far ahead of the curve that I... I don't feel so good. Sorry, I—I'm just gonna go over there... UGHH!
 Is it really that bad?
 It can't be that bad, can it?
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 elzer 04.ogg Elzer: Ahem... In my personal and honest opinion, this drink is absolutely... terrible.
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 elzer 05.ogg Elzer: Aren't you supposed to be Diona's assistant? Thie drinks that she makes are out of this world.
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 elzer 06.ogg Elzer: You used the same ingredients and followed nearly the same mixing process.
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 elzer 07.ogg Elzer: But how is it that the drinks she makes are never bad?
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 connor 04.ogg Connor: It's true. No matter what new and unusual ingredients she uses, Diona has never disappointed a single customer.
 (When did this guy come back?)
 (These two are starting to gesture to each other again.)
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 elzer 08.ogg Elzer: If you don't believe me, you can ask anyone who's ever gone for a drink in Mondstadt. There's not a single soul that doesn't reminisce about your specialty drinks. All it takes is a single sip, and you'd wish that you could drink it for the rest of your life.
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 diona 05.ogg Diona: D—Drink... for the rest of your life?
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 connor 05.ogg Connor: Yeah, and the most impressive part of it all is the never-ending list of new ingredients that you are using.
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 connor 06.ogg Connor: No matter what kind of ingredients it may be, if you make it, it'll be delicious.
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 diona 06.ogg Diona: D—Delicious...
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 connor 07.ogg Connor: After all, you are the genius bartender of Mondstadt, an originator of unique drinks, and the pinnacle of...
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 connor 08.ogg Connor: Huh? Diona? Are you alright?
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 elzer 09.ogg Elzer: No, Connor! You overdid it!
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 connor 09.ogg Connor: Ah, did I really? Sorry, I couldn't control myself!
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 diona 07.ogg Diona: No, stop...
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 diona 08.ogg Diona: Stop joking around! I can make a drink that tastes like that! Here, watch this!
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 diona 09.ogg Diona: Give me that drink you just made, I'll show you!
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 diona 10.ogg Diona: I'm going to add all the remaining ingredients! Lizard Tails, Fish Scales, mucus, and the Slime Condensate!
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 diona 11.ogg Diona: And stirrr... C'mon be dreadful, be awful, be absolutely disgusting! Ugh, it can't be that hard!
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 diona 12.ogg Diona: Done! My all-new specialty, and this time...
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 connor 10.ogg Connor: Oh my! What a fragrance!
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 elzer 10.ogg Elzer: *gasp* And the color!
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 connor 11.ogg Connor: What is this delightful smell? It's like a whole new sensation for me!
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 elzer 11.ogg Elzer: What is this unique coloring? Hoho... it's another perfect drink!
Media:vo dancop001 1910705 diona 13.ogg Diona: Grrr... Stop joking around, you two old drunks!

To Change the Winds[]

(Talk to Thoma again)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 19.ogg Thoma: So, have you had any ideas?

(Ask Takashi)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 takashi 01.ogg Takashi: ...You're asking me what I think Thoma could do better?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 takashi 02.ogg Takashi: He's busy enough as it is, don't you think? I barely see him around here at the Commission.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 takashi 03.ogg Takashi: And when I do, more often than not, he's busy with the housework.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 takashi 04.ogg Takashi: I think he should carry on doing what he's doing. Everyone's got their own way of living, and Thoma's no different.
(Ask Masanobu)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 masanobu 01.ogg Masanobu: Greetings, welcome to the Yashiro Commission.
 About Thoma...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 masanobu 02.ogg Masanobu: People have been talking about him behind his back? Surely not.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 masanobu 03.ogg Masanobu: He does a wonderful job and always remains modest about it. Why would anyone single him out?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 masanobu 04.ogg Masanobu: Huh, I can't figure it out. Try asking someone else.

(Ask Kiyoe)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912101 kiyoe 01.ogg Kiyoe: Oh... Ugh, this is going to be a problem...
 What's the matter?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912101 kiyoe 02.ogg Kiyoe: Oh... you're Miss Kamisato's friend, aren't you?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912101 kiyoe 03.ogg Kiyoe: Basically, something downright awful's happened, and we're discussing what on earth we should do about it...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912101 kiyoe 04.ogg Kiyoe: In preparation for the festival next month, we procured some very precious ceremonial implements from another island.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912101 kiyoe 05.ogg Kiyoe: But as luck would have it, our ship got hit by strong winds out at sea. The entire shipment is now sitting at the bottom of the ocean.
 Do you have a backup plan?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912101 kiyoe 06.ogg Kiyoe: Well, certainly there's no time to go all the way back out there and buy another batch... Our only option is a gentleman based on Narukami Island by the name of Yuusaku.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912101 kiyoe 07.ogg Kiyoe: But he's a shrewd one. He caught on to the fact that we needed the goods urgently and raised prices sky-high.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912101 kiyoe 08.ogg Kiyoe: Clearly he wants to take us for every Mora we're worth — it's a real dilemma.
 Can't you barter him down?
 Use the Yashiro name to put pressure on him.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912101 kiyoe 09.ogg Kiyoe: We've tried, but he just won't budge. It doesn't help that he has something of a feud with the Yashiro Commision...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912101 kiyoe 10.ogg Kiyoe: He once sold us some ceremonial implements of exceptionally poor quality. We returned the items and exposed his malpractice in the process.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912101 kiyoe 11.ogg Kiyoe: He's resented us ever since. Now that he actually has the chance to get back at us, there's no way he'll back down.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912101 kiyoe 12.ogg Kiyoe: The Yashiro Commission doesn't have any direct authority over merchants. We could file a formal complaint, but the process is long and drawn out, and the festival is drawing nearer every day.
 (This seems like a job for Thoma...)
 (It can't hurt to discuss this with Thoma...)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912101 kiyoe 13.ogg Kiyoe: Kazumasa and Furusawa have marched off to see him, but I don't know whether they'll be able to resolve it.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912101 kiyoe 14.ogg Kiyoe: I really hope the festival goes smoothly...
(Talk to Kiyoe again)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912101 kiyoe 14.ogg Kiyoe: I really hope the festival goes smoothly...

(Tell Thoma of the Yashiro Commission emergency)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912112 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: ...Oh, that whole situation, huh.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912112 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: I heard a thing or two about it. I was planning on finding some time to sort it out after entertaining you.
 So you know a solution?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912112 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: It's hard to say for sure. I'd need to talk with the guy first.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912112 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Since this has piqued your interest — how about we head over there together?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912112 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Still... the original plan here was to focus on your enjoyment, not rope you into the trials and tribulations of the Yashiro Commission
 I want people to give you the respect you deserve.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912112 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Ah, so that's your goal here.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912112 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: Well, if that is what you really want, I'd better give this my best shot.
 Trials and tribulations with Thoma are bound to be fun!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912112 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Oh? You think so?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912112 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: Well, in that case, I guess I'd better look alive!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912112 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: C'mon then, let's get ourselves over to Yuusaku and see what's what.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912112 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: I got some intel on him once before. At this time of day, he should be downtown in Inazuma City.

(Talk to Yuusaku)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 kazumasa 01.ogg Kazumasa: Your asking price just isn't realistic. What point are you trying to make here, huh?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 furusawa 01.ogg Furusawa: If the festival gets delayed, don't say we didn't warn you!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 01.ogg Yuusaku: *clears throat*...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 02.ogg Yuusaku: Help!!! I'm being attacked by Yashiro samurai!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 kazumasa 02.ogg Kazumasa: What!? Hey, cut that out!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 furusawa 02.ogg Furusawa: You little... Ahem, t—take it easy, would you? Look, we're not going to harm you, alright?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 03.ogg Yuusaku: The Yashiro Commission is forcing me to sell against my will! Doushin! I need a Doushin!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 kazumasa 03.ogg Kazumasa: Tsk, looks like there's no negotiation to be had here. Come on, let's get out of here!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 furusawa 03.ogg Furusawa: Wait up...
(Furusawa and Kazumasa leave)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 04.ogg Yuusaku: Hmph, is that all they got? Amateurs. The nerve... Oh, hello... you're...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Hello again.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 05.ogg Yuusaku: Wait, I know you! Well, if it isn't the Yashiro Commission's errand boy — Thoma!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 06.ogg Yuusaku: Do you know how long the Tenryou Commission locked me up for? And all thanks to you, going on about my goods being cheap fakes!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: You almost make it sound like I planted something and framed you. Those goods were defective, you know that, right?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 07.ogg Yuusaku: Ugh, you're so pedantic! Think how many festivals there are in a given year. Now take candles, for example — do you have any idea how many they go through? I could switch half of them out for duds without a single person noticing, and make a small fortune in the process...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 08.ogg Yuusaku: I was happily providing you with some much-needed supplies. Not only were you ungrateful, you had the audacity to report me.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 09.ogg Yuusaku: Well, now the tables have finally turned and you're begging for my help. Can you really blame me for charging a little extra?
 This is more than a "little" extra...
 This price is bankruptcy, even for the Yashiro Commission...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 10.ogg Yuusaku: Look, I found out what happened. The Commission's shipment ran into a storm and is now lying at the bottom of the ocean.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 11.ogg Yuusaku: The festival's right around the corner, so postponing it isn't an option. Right now, I'm the only one selling what you need...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 12.ogg Yuusaku: If the festival goes pear-shaped and Guuji Yae or the Almighty Shogun hears about it, they are not going to be happy... and then you'll have a real problem on your hands.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 13.ogg Yuusaku: So you might want to consider your position here!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: C'mon boss, this is all a little heartless. Besides, aside from the Yashiro Commission, no one else buys ceremonial items. Surely resolving this dispute swiftly is in your interest too?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 14.ogg Yuusaku: Don't give me that. The fact is, you're desperate to buy, and I ain't desperate to sell.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 15.ogg Yuusaku: The batch I have here can go to waste for all I care — it'd be no great loss.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Looks like we can't come to an agreement, then...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 16.ogg Yuusaku: Well, I'm glad it's dawning on you. You can either pay up, or look like a bunch of idiots when the festival comes around. Your choice!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 yuusaku 17.ogg Yuusaku: *sigh* Time's precious, and I've given you a fair slice of mine today. When you're ready to pay, I'll be ready to talk.
Yuusaku turns and leaves, without looking back
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: *sigh*
 He already left...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Yeah, I think it's pretty clear that he doesn't intend to discuss this any further.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: I guess his time in the Police Station didn't make for happy memories.
 Do you want me to mention this to Guuji Yae?
 Do you want me to mention this to the Raiden Shogun?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: No need.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: I can't say I think much of the way Yuusaku is acting... but ultimately, the issue here lies with the Yashiro Commission.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: We were the ones who lost the goods, so the responsibility is on us to find a solution. Otherwise, even if we ride this out, the Yashiro Commission's reputation will take a huge hit.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912102 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Let's go. There are a few people I want to introduce you to.

A Friend[]

(Talk to Yasutake)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 01.ogg Yasutake: Ah, if it isn't Thoma!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 02.ogg Yasutake: I must say I'm surprised to see you. Last I heard you were in Ritou... then you just vanished into thin air.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 03.ogg Yasutake: Who's the new face?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), a friend.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 04a.ogg Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 04b.ogg Yasutake: "Friend"? What, uh, line of work is this (‍guyguyText for male Traveler/young ladyyoung ladyText for female Traveler‍) in, then?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: They're not a connection, if that's what you're thinking. Just a regular friend.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 thoma 03a.ogg Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 thoma 03b.ogg Thoma: No vested interests here. I originally wanted to take (‍himhimText for Aether/herherText for Lumine‍) out for some down time, but we've ended up mired in Commission-related complications.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 05.ogg Yasutake: Hahaha... Okay, I see, my mistake.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 06.ogg Yasutake: So, what's the situation today, then? I only ever see you when you need something.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: I remember last time we spoke, you were grumbling about a lack of Iron Ore. Have you made any progress on that front?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 07.ogg Yasutake: Why? You got any supplier recommendations?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 08.ogg Yasutake: You're a little out of the loop, my friend — we increased our bid price a while back. Soon after, we found plenty of sellers were pulling out all the stops to import stock from wherever they could get ahold of it.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 09.ogg Yasutake: I heard some people were so eager to get in on the action that they even took out loans to get ahead of the competition. If you were hoping to enter the bidding now... I'm afraid you're a little late to the party.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Sounds like now you have the opposite problem — more Iron Ore than you know what to do with.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 10.ogg Yasutake: That's right, we're going to have to select a few sellers from the pool. There are certain candidates under consideration already, but we're still on the fence.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: I see. Well, would you mind if I gave you a couple of tips?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: As it happens, I'd noticed that shipments of Iron Ore had recently picked up. I looked into it a little, and managed to get a sense of which sellers had the quality stock, which offered competitive prices, and so on.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 11.ogg Yasutake: You don't say? Alright then, here's the list of sellers. Give me your thoughts.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: These two are veterans of the business. Regular sales, quality stock, but their price is a little steep. I think you could talk them down, though — I'd say to around 80% of what they've quoted you.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: This one sprung up out of nowhere recently in Ritou. Their approach is high volume, small profit margins. The quality's not too bad, but there's always a few duds, so you'd need to inspect the goods thoroughly upon receipt.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: This one grabbed a loan and leapt straight onto the bandwagon. In their haste, I fear they may have ended up with a mixed bag as far as quality is concerned. Given that their price isn't particularly competitive, either... I wouldn't consider them if I were you.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 12.ogg Yasutake: Wait, I know this name... Ah, yes. I believe we're on the same page here.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Haha... To be completely up front, this is really quite important to me, so your help in this regard would be greatly appreciated.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 13.ogg Yasutake: Don't mention it, it's no skin off my back.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 14.ogg Yasutake: There is something I hope you could do for me in return, though. Recently, several of our deliveries of Iron Ore have been getting stolen. Is there anything you can do to help?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 15.ogg Yasutake: It's the worst on the road between Konda Village and Inazuma City... something always seems to happen along that stretch.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: No problem. We'll be back before you know it.
 What is going on here...?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: I guess you have a few questions, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)... I'll explain everything later — but it looks like we'll need to get to work pretty soon.
(Talk to Yasutake again)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912103 yasutake 16.ogg Yasutake: Thank you for helping look into the situation with our deliveries.

(Talk to Hironori)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912108 hironori 01.ogg Hironori: Argh, man this hurts... those monsters came out of nowhere..
Media:vo tmcop001 1912108 hironori 02.ogg Hironori: Thank you both for your help. Who are you...?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912108 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Hi there. Yasutake commissioned us to come and assist with the delivery.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912108 hironori 03.ogg Hironori: Wonderful. I was starting to think I'd never get this Iron Ore to its destination.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912108 hironori 04.ogg Hironori: Um... so, do I owe you anything for this?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912108 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Nope, this is between us and Yasutake.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912108 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: He's the one you should be thanking, if anyone.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912108 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Alright (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), let's do this!

(If time ran out, cargo HP bar is empty, or deliberately abandon the challenge)
The cargo has been seized. It seems that this plan has fallen through...
(Return to the previous step)
(After clearing first wave)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912109 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Careful, there could be more monsters to come.
(After clearing second wave)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912109 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Almost there now... one final push...

(After clearing third wave)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912110 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Alright, I think we can leave the goods here.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912110 hironori 01.ogg Hironori: Many thanks.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912110 hironori 02.ogg Hironori: There were so many monsters, I didn't even see where they came from... It was a dicey situation...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912110 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: The route should be safe from here on out. We'll be heading off now.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912110 hironori 03.ogg Hironori: Sure thing. Again, my thanks to both of you.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912110 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: All in a day's work. Come on, let's go, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).

(Report back to Yasutake)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912104 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Worry no more, good sir, your goods have been safely delivered.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912104 yasutake 01.ogg Yasutake: Good to know. As for the issue you needed my help with, I have someone on the case — you can expect a resolution very shortly.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912104 yasutake 02.ogg Yasutake: You always seem to be cleaning up for other people behind the scenes, it must keep you pretty busy. Seems to eat up all of your personal time, too.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912104 yasutake 03.ogg Yasutake: Speaking of... I'm going to need your help again in a few days time. There's a meeting coming up, and several trade associations will be fighting tooth and nail over the chance to make a profit. You'll have to mediate on this one.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912104 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Ah, that rings a bell. Not a problem, I'll be there.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912104 yasutake 04.ogg Yasutake: One other thing... I heard Sakai gave our guy a loan a while back. Just thought you might be interested to know.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912104 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Is that so? Sounds like I should go talk to him, then. Thanks again for all your help, much obliged.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912104 yasutake 05.ogg Yasutake: Think nothing of it. Goodbye for now, I'll see you in a few days' time.
The person says goodbye and leaves.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912104 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Okay, this problem is halfway solved.
 So, who was that?
 What were you talking about?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912104 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: That was the quartermaster of the Tenryou Commission. He's in charge of all their procurement, and also responsible for keeping their weapon supplies intact.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912104 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Making weapons involves purchasing raw materials, so he's the key decision-maker in all the related trade in Iron Ore.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912104 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: The Iron Ore trade is actually what I was discussing with him just now.
 But what does that have to do with ceremonial affairs...?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912104 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: On the surface, not a whole lot, I'll admit. But you'll see. Very shortly.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912104 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: But before that, time to go visit another old friend of mine.

A Comeback's Always on the Cards[]

(Talk to Sakai)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912114 sakai 01.ogg Sakai: Ah, Thoma. You too?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912114 sakai 02.ogg Sakai: Yasutake sent someone over already. But I'm telling you, Thoma, I just don't know if it's feasible.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912114 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Really? Why, is there a problem?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912114 sakai 03.ogg Sakai: You betcha. The guy owes me Mora, for sure, but there's a long repayment period on that loan. If I go hounding him for Mora now, that makes me the bad guy.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912114 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: But as I recall, the only reason he was entitled to such a long period was because at the outset, he had a business relationship with the Yashiro Commission.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912114 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: So, if we sever ties with him, surely he'd have to pay you back right away.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912114 sakai 04.ogg Sakai: In principle, that's how it works. But I'd still be the one who has to take all the flak.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912114 sakai 05.ogg Sakai: I'm just a small-timer, you know? People like me need stability and security, not to go rocking the boat...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912114 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: C'mon now, let's work something out. Weren't you after some Noctilucous Jade last time we spoke? We can put our heads together and get hold of some for you.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912114 sakai 06.ogg Sakai: Hmm... Well, Noctilucous Jade would be good for starters, but...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912114 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: For starters? I'd say that's plenty for now... You don't want to go biting off more than you can chew, right?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912114 sakai 07.ogg Sakai: You... okay, fine.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912114 sakai 08.ogg Sakai: If you bring me some Noctilucous Jade, I'll get my hands dirty for you!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912114 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Great. Alright, let's go and find some, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).

(Report back to Sakai)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912111 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Okay, is this enough?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912111 sakai 01.ogg Sakai: Plenty. Leave the rest to me, I promise you'll be satisfied customers.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912111 sakai 02.ogg Sakai: You know Thoma, you haven't changed one bit. Same mindset, same style of working.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912111 sakai 03.ogg Sakai: I sure hope the two of us never get into a conflict. Fingers crossed our cooperation will stay happy and healthy for a long time to come.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912111 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Don't you worry, unless you've got plans to cause trouble for the Yashiro Commission, the future looks bright for all our future dealings.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912111 sakai 04.ogg Sakai: Phew, that's good to hear. Okay, I'll be seeing you, folks.
 Can we really trust this guy?
 It felt like there was a subtext to your whole conversation...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912111 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Don't worry.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912111 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: People whose attention is always focused on other people's weaknesses tend to expose their own weaknesses pretty easily.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912111 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Let's head back to the Yashiro Commission headquarters.

(Return to the Yashiro Commission)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 kazumasa 01.ogg Kazumasa: *sigh*... What do we do now?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 furusawa 01.ogg Furusawa: We could try... asking him nicely? Maybe he'd have a change of heart?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 kazumasa 02.ogg Kazumasa: I highly doubt that would work...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 kazumasa 03.ogg Kazumasa: Then again, since we don't have any other options, we might as well give it a try.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 furusawa 02.ogg Furusawa: But the samurai spirit...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 kazumasa 04.ogg Kazumasa: We serve the head of the clan. If the clan is in trouble, we must bear whatever humiliation comes our way to resolve the situation. This, too, is the samurai spirit!
(Yuusaku runs in)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 yuusaku 01.ogg Yuusaku: Phew... Uh, i—is anyone there?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 kazumasa 05.ogg Kazumasa: Huh, what's he doing here?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 furusawa 03.ogg Furusawa: He must be here to make fun of us.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 kazumasa 06.ogg Kazumasa: There's nothin' we can do about it. Brace yourself...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 kazumasa 07.ogg Kazumasa: I apologize![Note 1]
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 yuusaku 02.ogg Yuusaku: I apologize!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 kazumasa 08.ogg Kazumasa: ...Huh?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 yuusaku 03.ogg Yuusaku: I apologize! Forgive me, I'll sell to you at the original price... no, what am I saying, make that half price!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 kazumasa 09.ogg Kazumasa: What's going on here?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 yuusaku 04.ogg Yuusaku: Thoma? Thoma, are you here?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 yuusaku 05.ogg Yuusaku: I was completely in the wrong. However much you need, I'll sell it to you. I've got a warehouse full of stock, too, if you need more. Please, you'll have everything you could need!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: ...And without any duds this time, I assume?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 yuusaku 06.ogg Yuusaku: None, none whatsoever! I'll stake my whole reputation on it — no fakes, no defects! I give you my word!
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 yuusaku 07.ogg Yuusaku: P—Please, this is my whole livelihood... don't cut me off...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 02.ogg Thoma:  Since you've promised not to sneak in any fakes this time around, go ahead with the shipment. Once we've inspected the goods, and if all's in order, I'm sure whatever problems you're presently facing will quickly disappear.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 yuusaku 08.ogg Yuusaku: Okay, I'll deliver the goods right away! Right away, I promise...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: You see what I mean? Getting things settled as soon as possible is in everyone's best interests.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: *sigh*... Alright, with that taken care of, let's get out of here.
(Thoma swiftly disappears)
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 kazumasa 10.ogg Kazumasa: Why was he apologizing... to Thoma?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 furusawa 04.ogg Furusawa: What's going on here? Hey, Thoma...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 furusawa 05.ogg Furusawa: That's strange, where'd he go? He was right here a second ago...
You find Thoma in the corridor, sweeping...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Okay, the floors are done.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Next, I need to dust down the railings...
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: I only took one day off, but look how much dust has gathered. This is what I mean when I say cleaning is a daily chore.
 Just now...
 What happened?
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: You remember what he said, don't you? His goods could go unsold, and it wouldn't bother him.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: So the solution in this case was to cut off his main line of business, and make him really feel the heat.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: The Yashiro Commission doesn't have the authority to meddle in the business world. But, as it happened, I knew a few of his major customers, so I sorted it out privately.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: When he realized he couldn't shift his product, had no source of revenue, and wouldn't be able to pay off his loan... he suddenly felt the pressure.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: Then, I just had to make sure he caught wind of what the cause of his problems was, so he'd seek us out to make an apology.
 Sounds like you gave him the full Thoma treatment.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: It's no big deal. I've dealt with plenty of situations like this in the past.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: I know you'd like people to look up to me more, but... it doesn't bother me all that much.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: I'm just the housekeeper of the Kamisato Clan — reputation isn't all that important to me. On the contrary, having too good of a reputation can be restrictive.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: You feel indignant for my sake when you hear people spreading gossip about me, don't you? That says that in your mind, I'm not the kind of person they say I am.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 17.ogg Thoma: For me, that's enough. All I need is for the people I'm close with to know the real me.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 18.ogg Thoma: Thanks for your help in averting a potential crisis for the Yashiro Commission. I owe you one! I'll have to entertain you again some time.
Media:vo tmcop001 1912105 thoma 19.ogg Thoma: Ah, plus I didn't get very far with entertaining you this time around... so, I guess I owe the both you!

The Housekeeper's Other Side

"Looks like being a housekeeper's the more relaxing and interesting job after all."

Notes[]

↑ Even though this is Yuusaku's line, the camera pans to Kazumasa, who is silently expecting Yuusaku's mocking.

Fresh Air[]

(Talk to Layla)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916102 layla 01.ogg Layla: Even the air here feels more relaxing.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916102 layla 02.ogg Layla: I just wanna forget about the thesis altogether! ...Heh, I'm just kidding. Knowing me, I'd only be able to forget about it for a little while.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916102 layla 03.ogg Layla: This doesn't count as trying to avoid my problems, does it?
 Your state of mind is just as important as efficiency if you want to solve the problems that you're facing.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916102 layla 04.ogg Layla: That's quite the legitimate excuse... Hmm, no, it's more of an "explanation." Hah, even I'm starting to get bolder with my words.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916102 layla 05.ogg Layla: I grew up in a place like this. Looking into the distance now with the breeze in my face makes me feel like a kid again.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916102 layla 06.ogg Layla: Those were the happiest days...
 What did you usually do as a kid?
Media:vo lylcop001 1916102 layla 07.ogg Layla: Hmm... I had a bunch of friends back then, and we would go pick wild berries in the woods.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916102 layla 08.ogg Layla: No matter what ingredients we found, we would cook them over a fire, and whoever lost one of our games would have to eat all of it.
 That sounds a little intense...
Media:vo lylcop001 1916102 layla 09.ogg Layla: No, it wasn't that bad. It really depended on how lucky you were. Grilled Apples and Sunsettias are actually quite delicious.
 Why don't we go find something to grill as well?
Media:vo lylcop001 1916102 layla 10.ogg Layla: Sure, I haven't done that in ages. Let's go!
(Follow Layla)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916103 layla 01.ogg Layla: Apples and Zaytun Peaches were the most popular fruits back then.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916103 layla 02.ogg Layla: And of course, grilled fish is delicious, too. Oh, fish skin releases oils while cooking, which drip into the fire and cause it to burn even brighter.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916103 layla 03.ogg Layla: But we would always get yelled at by the grown-ups if they caught us sneaking into the river to catch fish.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916103 layla 04.ogg Layla: "What's the big deal? We just wanna swim!" That's what we used to say.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916103 layla 05.ogg Layla: But now that I think about it, it really was quite dangerous. Thank goodness nothing bad ever happened...
(Gather ingredients and give them to Layla)
(Using Nahida's All Schemes to Know to Layla, optional)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916104 layla 02.ogg Layla: (I've been getting hungry thinking about food all this time...)
(Talk to Layla)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916104 layla 01.ogg Layla: I think we've found enough now, don't you?
(Submit  Fresh Apple ×3,  Plump Harra Fruit ×3, or  Juicy Zaytun Peach ×3)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916106 layla 01.ogg Layla: Alright, these should be enough.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916106 layla 02.ogg Layla: There's nothing like the smell of fresh ingredients. They already smell delicious.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916106 layla 03.ogg Layla: I'll be here cleaning the ingredients. Can you please fetch some firewood for us?
(Continue to Like the Old Days)

Like the Old Days[]

(Using Nahida's All Schemes to Know to Layla, optional)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916107 layla 02.ogg Layla: (This is a good spot for a fire. Even if the fire was to spread, it'd be easy to contain.)
(Talk to Layla)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916107 layla 01.ogg Layla: I'll be here washing the ingredients. Can you please fetch some firewood for us?
(Collect Dry Firewood ×3)
(Talk to Layla)
You make a fire with Layla and enjoy the delicious food.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 01.ogg Layla: Mmm, fresh food is the best. I feel like I've traveled back in time.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 02.ogg Layla: We all used to run around in the woods when we were kids. Trees and mud was [sic] the world we knew best.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 03.ogg Layla: It doesn't matter how long I'm away from the forest, I won't ever forget the feeling of running through the trees.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 04.ogg Layla: How about you? Can you relate to that feeling? It's almost like not knowing the world will change or ever expecting it to change.
 I'm afraid not. I'm an adventurer, after all.
 Although adventurers rarely ever stay in one place, I hope I can experience that feeling one day.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 05.ogg Layla: Whatever the case, it's a very warm feeling.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 06.ogg Layla: In the end, I passed the admissions exam, and the life I had led came to an abrupt end.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 07.ogg Layla: Later, as I sat in a lecture at the Akademiya, my mind started to wander and I began to think about home. It was then that I realized how long it had been since I went back.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 08.ogg Layla: "Ahh, I can't go back anymore," and other similar thoughts started to come to mind... I guess I'm still not used to being in the Akademiya yet.
 There is a purpose for every stage in life.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 09.ogg Layla: You're right, so we should let go of the past. I suppose this is also a part of growing up.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 10.ogg Layla: But reminiscing about the carefree life of being a kid sure works wonders for the mind...
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 11.ogg Layla: You start missing those moments once you leave them behind... and that's a part of moving forward.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 12.ogg Layla: From now on, I'd like to cherish every single day of my life... even when it's not the smoothest of rides.
 Everything will get better. I know you can do it.
(Stress Value −1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 13.ogg Layla: Hehe, I'll take the compliment.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 14.ogg Layla: A little bit of sugar and a good view really go a long way for relaxation.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 15.ogg Layla: I thought it'd be impossible for me to enjoy something like this. I thought I'd never be able to get my mind off my thesis.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 16.ogg Layla: But now, I feel like I'm fully enjoying myself. It's really great. So, what are we doing next?
 Sometimes, you don't need a plan.
 It's nice to just stroll around and see what happens.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 17.ogg Layla: You're right. I've been doing research for so long that I'm used to having a certain routine...
Media:vo lylcop001 1916108 layla 18.ogg Layla: A carefree stroll... I like the sound of that.
(Proceed to One Hearty Meal Later)

A Greater Problem[]
 Quest DescriptionAfter getting free of her academic tangles, Faruzan decides to first go to Pardis Dhyai...

(Return to Pardis Dhyai)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917302 collei 01.ogg Collei: Master, we're back! ...Huh? Where did he go?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917302 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: You don't have to shout. I can hear you.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917302 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Well, you got here much faster than I expected. I thought you'd have a lot more business to take care of.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917302 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Thanks to (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), I was able to, uh... pawn off various problems of mine onto others.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917302 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Onto others? What does that mean...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917302 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: Uh... We can discuss that later. You're looking for me because of the "thing" you mentioned in the letter, right?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917302 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: That's right. Please, follow me.
(Enter Pardis Dhyai)
Media:vo frzcop001 karkata upset 01.ogg Karkata: Kolu...
 Karkata!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 collei 01.ogg Collei: A m—monster? Why is there a monster here!?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Don't be scared, Collei. This is the mechanical life form (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) and I saved a while back. Its name is Karkata.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: ...It's the final work of a late junior of mine.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: You mean Abattouy? He must've been a genius to create one of such polish all by himself.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: It's uncommon that a Spantamad researcher is able to create such an intricate machine. If he were still around, we could probably chat the day away. What a shame...
Media:vo frzcop001 karkata upset 01.ogg Karkata: Kolu...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: Hmm? Something seems wrong here. Have you been maintaining it? Mechanical life forms are much more fragile than they look.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 collei 02.ogg Collei: Is Karkata... sick?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Karkata has been lying down like this since a few days ago. It could be an old malfunction acting up again.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: I've taken a few courses conducted by Spantamad before, so I've managed to perform some... passable repairs on Karkata's energy supply module. However, it seems the issue this time is with its transmission.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: My knowledge can only prevent its condition from deteriorating any further, but Madam Faruzan, you should be able to find a way to repair it.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: Not necessarily. Mechanical life forms are created using techniques from alchemy, elemental science, and more.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: There are multiple modules here that influence each other. A simplistic knowledge of mechanisms will not serve here. You know that as well.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: Each mechanical life form is very different from the next, so even I cannot be sure if my understanding of mechanical life forms is going to be of any use to our little crab friend here.
Media:vo frzcop001 karkata upset 01.ogg Karkata: Kolu...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 collei 03.ogg Collei: Karkata...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: *sigh* Can you all go outside for a minute? I need a bit of space. Before I do a thorough check, everything we've just said is but conjecture.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917303 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: Alright. We're counting on you, Madam Faruzan.
(Talk to Karkata or Faruzan again, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 karkata upset 01.ogg Karkata: Kolu...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917305 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Who knew that I'd encounter a mechanical life form in this manner after a hundred years?
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Faruzan, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917301 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: (Mechanical life forms... are truly incredible.)
(Talk to Collei again, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917305 collei 01.ogg Collei: I didn't know mechanical life forms could get sick, too... You have to get better soon, Karkata!
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Collei, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917301 collei 02.ogg Collei: (Hope you feel better soon, Karkata!)
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Tighnari, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917301 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: (I hope Karkata will recover quickly.)
(Talk with Tighnari as you wait for the results)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: We'll wait here till Faruzan finishes her inspection. In the meantime, I'd like to talk to you about her.
 I also wanted to ask about her past...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Her past, huh? Quite a few people in the Akademiya know about what happened to her. Perhaps it'd be best if I'm the one to tell you.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: I've told you before that she had disappeared for 100 years, right? From her perspective, "trapped" might be a more apt description.
 Trapped?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Her exact words were...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 01.ogg "That ruin was crawling with traps and coded inscriptions from wall to wall."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 02.ogg "I did all I could to decipher the code and deactivate the traps to escape the ruin, but there was no way out."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 03.ogg "I lost track of time, and I ran out of pen and paper. In the end, I had to use stone shards to write on the walls and on the floor to decipher the code."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 04.ogg "Then, before I realized it, I ran out of space on the walls and floor. I had to calculate all the possibilities in my mind."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 05.ogg "After that, my memory started to become fuzzy, and my cognition slowed down."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: She doesn't remember anything else, including the location of the ruin and how she finally managed to escape.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: When she was found in the outskirts of Sumeru a few years ago, she looked exactly the same as she did 100 years prior. However, she was in a stupor and struggled to form sentences. Only after a lengthy recovery period could she speak again.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: The Akademiya speculates that she must have gotten trapped in an unknown ruin while researching machines a century ago.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: And because of the ruin's special properties that halted her aging, she was able to use those 100 years to crack the trapping mechanism and then escape.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: Though she had finally broken free, one hundred years had passed — everyone she knew and everyone who knew her was already gone...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: In the end, even the Akademiya had to rely on century-old records in the Akasha to confirm her existence...
 ...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: Don't make that face. I'm not telling you this because I want to drum up sympathy. She wouldn't want others to pity her because of past events.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 12.ogg Tighnari: Rather, she sees that period of entrapment as an experimental error. As a researcher, she must accept everything that results from her experiments, even if they don't fall within expectations.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 13.ogg Tighnari: Even after going through so much, she's returned to Sumeru and still hasn't given up on her research.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 14.ogg Tighnari: Due to changes over the years and drift in academic subjects, she holds some rather strong opinions about the current Akademiya, and she has no shortage of detractors herself.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 15.ogg Tighnari: What I want to say is that no matter what era we're in, Faruzan is a true senior researcher — in every sense of the word.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 16.ogg Tighnari: She has her own deep understanding of various ruins and machines. If there's a chance, you should talk about them with her. It'll definitely be helpful for your journey.
 I see.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 collei 01.ogg Collei: Master, Madam Faruzan's done!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 17.ogg Tighnari: Oh? Let's head over. With any luck, she might have figured something out.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: Phew. I never thought that I'd encounter a Restitution Module once again after 100 years. Abattouy really installed quite a few impressive things on this.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: If my guess is correct, this mechanical life form has displayed attempts at "self-sustenance" before, right? Such as collecting parts to repair itself, for instance.
 It has collected parts before, yes...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 18.ogg Tighnari: It used them for something else, but as far as its design goes, it does have a function like that.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: I knew it. If I'm not wrong, Karkata's issue lies with its Restitution Module.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: Abattouy's modified this module extensively, but the core parts and design philosophy are very similar to the principles as I know them — they are all based on principles learned from the ruins.
 From the ruins?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: The creators of the "ruins machine" once tried to create a perpetual mechanism that could replace life or even surpass it.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: The Restitution Module is the result of one of their countless attempts.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: It replicates the behavior of living things to achieve a self-repair function. However, the energy required and maintenance of the module became an issue.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 collei 02.ogg Collei: Energy consumption? Maintenance?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: For example, a living thing's heart can deliver nutrients and blood to various organs. However, the bigger the living thing, the more powerful the heart needs to be.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 14.ogg Faruzan: Once the heart is damaged, it'll be hard for that living thing to heal itself, and even the function of other organs can be affected. Thus, the attempt wasn't widely adopted.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 15.ogg Faruzan: Even 100 years ago, I'd only seen it once before... Oh dear, this is going to be a problem.
 Why's that?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 16.ogg Faruzan: Based on my current research, I'll need to swap out the damaged parts in the Restitution Module to repair Karkata.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 17.ogg Faruzan: But like I just said, the module is rare, even by the standards of ancient machines. Not only that, but there is very little related research documentation available.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 18.ogg Faruzan: Finding suitable parts would be like trying to find a single gear in the vast desert, to say nothing of the difficulty in making those parts from scratch.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 19.ogg Faruzan: *sigh* One can only wonder where Abattouy found the original parts...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 19.ogg Tighnari: I might have an idea. Abattouy was, for a time, quite passionate about excavating the Great Red Sand. This was when he had just gotten expelled from the Akademiya.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 20.ogg Faruzan: You mean to say he found a Restitution Module in the desert? Hmm... That is indeed possible...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 collei 03.ogg Collei: But the desert's huge! How are we supposed to find the parts that Karkata needs?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 21.ogg Faruzan: According to the Akademiya's records, no similar parts have been found in the Great Red Sand over the past 100 years. If we want to try our luck, we'll have to explore ruins that have never been explored before.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 20.ogg Tighnari: I do know that a Vahumana researcher formed an expedition team after the sandstorms and earthquakes subsided. They are now exploring areas of the desert that used to be difficult to access.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 collei 04.ogg Collei: Should we ask them if they've made any new discoveries lately?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 22.ogg Faruzan: The chances are slim, but it's at least more effective than running around like headless chickens.
 What's the lead researcher's name?
 Where is the archaeology team currently stationed?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 21.ogg Tighnari: His name is Raed. I think he's stationed at the northeast part of the Hypostyle Desert. Let's go look for him once Karkata settles down.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 23.ogg Faruzan: Oh, you and Collei should probably stay. Karkata's condition may be stable, but it would still be better if some of us stay to look after it.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 24.ogg Faruzan: Besides, you still need to take care of the "trouble" that the Akademiya left for me.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 tighnari 22.ogg Tighnari: "Trouble" from the Akademiya? I thought you said that you pawned it off to someone else. Wait, don't tell me...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917304 faruzan 25.ogg Faruzan: Hehe. I'll let Collei fill you in on the details. I look forward to seeing your work, Tighnari.
(Talk to Tighnari, Collei, or Karkata again, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917306 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: A "Fully Automated Irrigation System"... That's quite the task.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917306 collei 01.ogg Collei: Master, can I help with anything at all? I can go buy things, prepare pen and paper...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917306 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Oh, you know, I seem to remember that you have a lot of homework today.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917306 collei 02.ogg Collei: Huh? O—Oh, yeah, I do...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917306 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Well, hurry up and finish it so you can sleep early, or Faruzan will worry. That's the best thing you can do now to help.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917306 collei 03.ogg Collei: Oh... Okay...
Media:vo frzcop001 karkata upset 01.ogg Karkata: Kolu...

Media:vo frzcop001 1917305 bakr 01.ogg Bakr: Halt! Mr. Raed's permission is required to proceed any further!
 We're not outsiders.
 She's a researcher from the Akademiya.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917305 bakr 02.ogg Bakr: That still won't do. Mr. Raed told us to keep people away from the ruins, so they don't damage the site.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917305 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: Damage the site? I've excavated more ruins than you've visited restaurants! Which batch of students is Raed from? I want to see him right now.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917305 bakr 03.ogg Bakr: He isn't at the campsite now. You should all leave. Only he can give you permission to enter.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917305 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: Tsk. What a stubborn guy.
 We can't just waste our time here like this.
 Let's wait for that researcher to come back first.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917305 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: Mm, you're right. Even if there is new information, we still have to wait for him to come back so we can ask him about it. So let's just see what we can find out from the people here.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917305 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: Hmph. I'm going to give that Raed a good talking to when he gets back — starting from "who in the world mentored you."
(Talk to Bakr again or approach the machine wreckage, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 bakr 01.ogg Bakr: Halt! Mr. Raed's permission is required to proceed any further!
(Talk to the Chatty Villager)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 chattyvillagers 01.ogg Chatty Villager: That machine looks amazing! Could it be the legendary Ruin Wanderer?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 chattyvillagers 02.ogg Chatty Villager: The location seems to fit too... Might that legend actually be true?
(Talk to the Tired Villager)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 tiredvillagers 01.ogg Tired Villager: The ruins? Don't know anything. We were only hired to deliver water and supplies to them.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 tiredvillagers 02.ogg Tired Villager: Forget excavation — they won't even let us get close to the camp where they're staying.
(Talk to the Curious Villager)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 curiousvillagers 01.ogg Curious Villager: This area used to be ravaged by frequent sandstorms, but it's been calm lately for some reason...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 curiousvillagers 02.ogg Curious Villager: They say that this was done by a single traveler? But seriously, is such a thing even humanly possible?
(Organize the gathered information with Faruzan)
After asking around, Faruzan starts to organize the information she has gathered...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Well, I've found out everything I could. Is there anything that stands out to you?
 The hired villagers from Aaru Village...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: The villagers were hired to deliver supplies, but they haven't been allowed near the campsite. That's definitely odd.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: However, I'm more concerned about this "Ruin Wanderer" they speak of.
 The sandstorms dispersing...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: To be honest, the ruins were difficult to excavate in the past, but they really are much safer now, thanks to you.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: However, I'm more concerned about this "Ruin Wanderer" they speak of.
 This machine they speak of...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: "Ruin Wanderer"... That's the first time I've heard that name. But that wreckage did seem a bit weird...
 What's so weird about it?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: ...It's a bit far away, and I can't really say for sure from this distance. Perhaps we should ask the villager from before about the "legend" first.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 chattyvillagers 01.ogg Chatty Villager: Huh? What are you guys doing back here?
 I want to learn more about the legend of the Ruin Wanderer...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 chattyvillagers 02.ogg Chatty Villager: Haha, I wouldn't blame you for not knowing about it, youngsters. After all, it's a tale that's over a decade old.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 chattyvillagers 03.ogg Chatty Villager: It's said that this monster, the Ruin Wanderer, traversed through various ruins for centuries! Many adventurers had claimed to see it while exploring!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 chattyvillagers 04.ogg Chatty Villager: Some said that it was like a giant, while others said that it was like a beast. However, none knew why it wandered the ruins.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 chattyvillagers 05.ogg Chatty Villager: Then, about ten years ago, we stopped hearing any news about it in Sumeru. No one has seen it since then, and the legend has since faded into memory.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 chattyvillagers 06.ogg Chatty Villager: You youngsters probably don't know about the Ruin Wanderer nowadays, but it was famous for centuries!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: Centuries? Impossible! I heard nothing about it back then. It can only have been around for a few decades at most!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 chattyvillagers 07.ogg Chatty Villager: Wait, "back then"...?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: Indulge my curiosity for a moment. Why do you think that wreckage is the "Ruin Wanderer"?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 chattyvillagers 08.ogg Chatty Villager: Well, I had also heard that second-hand from—
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 raed 01.ogg ???: You heard that nonsense from the Eremites after they got drunk, right?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: Hmm? Who are you?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 raed 02.ogg Raed: Madam Faruzan, it is a pleasure. I'm Raed, the one who organized this archaeological expedition.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 raed 03.ogg Raed: I'd heard of you at the Akademiya, but I didn't expect to run into you here. Truly, it is an honor.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 raed 04.ogg Raed: And this must be the famous (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), I presume? What brings the two of you here?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: Have you found any special contraptions and relics in the ruins that you've been investigating?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 raed 05.ogg Raed: Uh, I'm ashamed to say that we haven't found anything noteworthy, even though we've been investigating for a while now...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: Really? That "Ruin Wanderer" isn't noteworthy to you?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 raed 06.ogg Raed: Heh, I'm afraid those are mere rumors. Really, I sometimes wish that those people would put as much effort into their work as they do into gossiping.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 chattyvillagers 09.ogg Chatty Villager: Uh, haha... You're right, sir. I'll get back to work now.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 raed 07.ogg Raed: The wise do not buy into rumors, so it is said. I believe that you too, Madam Faruzan, do not put any stock into such baseless talk?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: It is also said that real knowledge shall come from practice. I can help you research the excavated relics and see if I can find out anything new about them.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 faruzan 14.ogg Faruzan: You can take credit for any new discoveries — I believe this offer to be sufficiently attractive?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 raed 08.ogg Raed: Uh... In truth, I could ask for nothing better than your help with our research.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 raed 09.ogg Raed: However, you two must be tired after a long journey. I'd feel bad if I set you to work immediately.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 raed 10.ogg Raed: It's getting late and my subordinates and I are heading back to the camp to rest. Why don't you find a place to spend the night first? We can continue our discussion tomorrow.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 raed 11.ogg Raed: There's a tent that the villagers occasionally use to rest. It's a bit simple, yes, but I hope you won't mind.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917309 faruzan 15.ogg Faruzan: Since you need to rest as well, let's do just that.
(Talk to Raed again, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 raed 01.ogg Raed: There's a tent that the villagers occasionally use to rest. Like I said, it's a bit simple, yes, but I hope you won't mind.

Suspicion Abounds[]
 Step DescriptionAfter getting free of her academic tangles, Faruzan decides to first go to Pardis Dhyai...

(Go to the makeshift camp and rest)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Hmph, this is quite far away. Are they trying to prevent the villagers from eavesdropping on them? This suits us just fine though. This way, they won't overhear our conversations either.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: Now, I have my suspicions about this archaeological expedition team and that machine wreckage. I only caught a quick glimpse, and it was from a distance...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: ...But based on the condition of the armor and joints, it didn't seem like something that had been lying around for centuries. At most, I'd estimate that it only stopped moving about a dozen years ago.
 A dozen years ago?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: Yes. The timing coincides with the spreading of the legend. Now, assuming that it really is the "Ruin Wanderer"...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: How do you suppose it was able to maintain a relatively good condition despite high-intensity operation over the course of several decades?
 The Restitution Module!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: That's right. Technically speaking, the module shouldn't be able to move such a large machine chassis. However, I'm basing my knowledge on the mechanical life forms I've seen before...
 You've seen such life forms before?
 You've encountered others besides Karkata?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: Well, this was over 100 years ago. It was a machine about the same size as Karkata, actually. It couldn't carry heavy objects or fight, and was only able to help me record some notes.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: It also helped me deliver letters home. I found it near the desert, which is why I wondered if there might be more Restitution Modules buried around here.
 (A mechanical life form from 100 years ago...)
 (Is it no longer around?)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: Honestly, people in ancient times might have already solved the problem of providing enough power for all I know. I'll need to research this properly...
 Why didn't you go and investigate earlier?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: Had I confronted Raed right there and then, he would have said that he couldn't tell that the machine was special. Then he'd just hand it over to the Akademiya obediently... and he'd get away scot-free.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: If the wreckage were to be handed to the Akademiya, it'd be much tougher for us to do research on it or get spare parts for Karkata.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: Anyway, we should figure out what they're planning before making our next move.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: They insisted that we should stay the night, which means if they're trying to pull a fast one on us, they're likely to try it tonight. We must be vigilant.
As the night goes on, you hear faint sounds in the distance...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 14.ogg Faruzan: Are those sounds coming from the excavation site? Hah. I knew they wouldn't be able to wait. They must be scared that we might discover something tomorrow.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 15.ogg Faruzan: Not a single person guarding the campsite? This must be quite the manpower expenditure.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 16.ogg Faruzan: I'll see if they left any clues behind at their camp. Keep watch and help me stall them if it comes to that, would you?
 No problem.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917310 faruzan 17.ogg Faruzan: Alright. I'm counting on you.
(Go to the evacuation site)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 raed 01.ogg Raed: ...Why isn't the "tent" here yet? We need to switch it out tonight!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 bandak 01.ogg Bandak: I—It's still on the way. I'm afraid this is the first time we're delivering such a huge one...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 raed 02.ogg Raed: Hmph! You good-for-nothings are just a load of trouble, aren't you? We wouldn't have to deal with these interlopers if you had kept those lips of yours from flapping!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 raed 03.ogg Raed: Hurry up and hide our current "tent," and deliver the new one to me tonight no matter what it takes!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 bakr 01.ogg Bakr: Huh? Who's there?
 It's me.
 (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 raed 04.ogg Raed: Uh, Ahem! I'm sorry. I'm just a bit upset because my subordinates aren't doing their jobs properly. When did you get here?
 What's the tent you mentioned, if I might ask?
 What's this delivery I hear you're having trouble with?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 raed 05.ogg Raed: Uh, it's nothing. Just a tent. We didn't pack up all our tents from the last campsite. Some of them, along with a few people, have been left there.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 raed 06.ogg Raed: Someone damaged our current tent, so I'm trying to get my subordinates to get one from that previous campsite delivered here.
 And you're discussing that over here because...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 raed 07.ogg Raed: The relics in the ruins are highly valuable, so I'm worried that Treasure Hoarders and bandits might try to steal them. Since the tent isn't here yet and I can't fall asleep, I came here to patrol.
 There are people who'd steal these relics?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 raed 08.ogg Raed: Heh. Well, these things are antiques, after all. There will always be people interested in buying them. I hired so many people precisely because I was worried about that happening.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 raed 09.ogg Raed: Speaking of which, I'd like to ask... Is the Akademiya really aware that you've traversed through the desert to come here in the middle of the night?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 raed 10.ogg Raed: Also, where's Faruzan? Why isn't she with you?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: I'm right here. Also, you forgot to address me as "Madam."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: ...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 raed 11.ogg Raed: Ahem! Sorry... Madam Faruzan.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: ...You were all making so much noise that I couldn't sleep, which is why I got (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) to find out what was going on. But for some reason, that one task took forever, so I came to check in on the situation.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 raed 12.ogg Raed: Ah, I'm very sorry for disturbing your rest. I'll tell my subordinates to be quieter on patrol.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: Good. Come on, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), let's head back.
 We're heading back already?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: Yes. We came to check out the situation, didn't we? Well, we've already done that.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917311 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: We should get better rest so that we'll have energy to investigate tomorrow.
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Hmm?)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Was I mistaken?)
(Talk to Raed again, optional)

Thoughts That Wandered For a Century[]

(Return to the temporary camp and talk to Faruzan)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Thanks for dealing with them.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: Now, I found something good on my end. These are the excavation records from their campsite.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: According to them, the ruins have been raided before, with numerous traps and contraptions having already been triggered.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: I also observed the wreckage up close earlier. The weathering is nowhere near as extensive as on the relics that have been buried for over a hundred years.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: There's no doubt that the wreckage and the ruins don't belong to the same era. Instead, it must have "wandered" into the ruins about a dozen years ago.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: It could've fallen into a trap or encountered a glitch within the ruins, remaining stationary like that until it was discovered recently.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: However, I still don't know why they'd want to hide it. I have no doubt that the researcher could definitely reach the same conclusion I did.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: The last few pages of the excavation records are written in code, which I still need time to decipher. The answer may lie within those pages.
 You can decipher coded messages?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: Heh. It's just wordplay — and if anything, that's my wheelhouse.
Faruzan gets to work deciphering the code...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: Hmm... Just a bit more... Ah, I see now...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 bandak 01.ogg Bandak: H—Help, please help!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 raed 02.ogg Raed: W—Why are you running away? Come back! Protect me!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: What's that sound? Is it—
???: ...!!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: The Ruin Wanderer... reactivated!?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: That's impossible! Is this the work of some kind of hidden mechanism? ...Never mind, we have to focus on saving lives first! I'll cover them. You go stall the Ruin Wanderer!
???: ...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 14.ogg Faruzan: What? It ignored (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 bandak 02.ogg Bandak: Why is it chasing after us!?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 15.ogg Faruzan: What could have caused it to reactivate? And to give chase...?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 raed 03.ogg Raed: Darn it! Hey, come on, you lot! It's clear that we can't escape, so let's just attack it!
???: ...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917312 faruzan 16.ogg Faruzan: ...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 bakr 01.ogg Bakr: I—It stopped?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 raed 01.ogg Raed: ...Hey! You guys! Get up there and tell me what's going on!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 bandak 01.ogg Bandak: But what if it suddenly moves...?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 raed 02.ogg Raed: You... You good-for-nothings! Why is everyone I hired so useless? Move! I'll do it myself!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 raed 03.ogg Raed: Hmph. Looks like this thing's parts can't handle the load of functioning anymore after years of disrepair.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 raed 04.ogg Raed: Tch. When it first reactivated, I was wondering if it'd be as amazing as the legends had pegged it to be. I didn't expect it to be so much weaker than it looks. How disappointing.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Disappointing, you say? Now, is that because you won't be able to sell it for much?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 raed 05.ogg Raed: Uh... Faruzan, you may be my senior as an Akademiya researcher, but that doesn't mean you get to slander me!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: You wrote these "excavation records," did you not? Or perhaps calling it a "ledger" might jog your memory a bit better...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 raed 06.ogg Raed: Uh... I—I don't recognize that thing...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: "January 3rd: Excavated five tents."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: "January 5th: Three tents sold."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: "January 10th, 1 special tent pre-sold. It must quickly be switched out with an old tent..."
 So "tent"...
 ...Is your code name for relics?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: You're supposed to be an archaeological expedition team, and yet here you are, secretly selling the relics and profiting from it.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: When you believed that you had found the wreckage of the "Ruin Wanderer," you tried to switch in wreckage that you had excavated previously to pull the wool over the Akademiya's eyes.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: After all, there would probably be many wealthy buyers interested in purchasing the legendary "Ruin Wanderer" in the black market, yes? And then we arrived, just before you could finish your work.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: That forced you to speed up your plan and you tried to complete the switch overnight before I could investigate the wreckage. In your haste, however, you accidentally activated the "Ruin Wanderer" instead. Did I get that all right?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 raed 07.ogg Raed: I—I don't know what you're talking about!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: You lack the curiosity befitting a man of knowledge, nor do you have respect for mechanical life forms. You're not fit to be a researcher!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 raed 08.ogg Raed: Ridiculous! Curiosity? Respect? I'm not here to hear you preach! Hey, we're leaving!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 bakr 02.ogg Bakr: Mr. Raed!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 bandak 02.ogg Bandak: B—Behind you...

Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 bandak 04.ogg Bandak: Why is it chasing after us!?
(Flashback ends)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 faruzan 15.ogg Faruzan: ...So, you've been looking for me this whole time?

Media:vo frzcop001 tamimi upset 01.ogg ???: Kolu...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917313 faruzan 16.ogg Faruzan: Long time no see, Tamimi.
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Faruzan, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917301 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: (...)
(Read the Yellowed Note)
Yellowed Note: "...Tamimi's remodeling is going smoothly. As it is now, it can learn how to deal with various dangerous situations in the ruins on its own. I wish you could see it with your own eyes."
Yellowed Note: "As I worked, I kept thinking that you'd do a better job at this than I could."
Yellowed Note: "After all, you're the most exceptional student I've ever met."
(Read the Neatly-Penned Note)
Neatly-Penned Note: "Dear Madam Faruzan..."
Neatly-Penned Note: "The notes and manuscripts we found on Tamimi have been transcribed and organized, and every one of them has been marked with your name."
Neatly-Penned Note: "I hope that even after a hundred years, future generations of students will still remember your name, Madam Faruzan."
(Read the Oft-Corrected Note)
Oft-Corrected Note: "... I told you not to... Now, look... So many people... Worried... Even... Tamimi..."
Oft-Corrected Note: (The messy scribbling has been repeatedly canceled and edited, leaving barely legible phrases and a single neat message at the back.)
Oft-Corrected Note: "Hurry up and come home for a meal. Your mom always makes an extra portion of food, you know?"
(Investigate the fallen Machine Wreckage)
(Talk to Faruzan)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzanmom 01.ogg ???: "Dear Faruzan, I hope you're doing well."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzanmom 02.ogg ???: "It has been over 20 years since you went missing. People from the Akademiya keep telling us to give up and that you're most likely dead..."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzanmom 03.ogg ???: "But somehow, I feel like you're still alive — yes, that you live still, in some corner of this world."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzanmom 04.ogg ???: "You've always been persistent, able to shine no matter what situation you face. I believe that this persistence serves you well in surviving and finding your way home."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzanmom 05.ogg ???: "Unfortunately, I likely won't be able to welcome you home when you do. I don't have much time left, and my reflexes have slowed. Others keep telling me to stop exploring ruins..."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzanmom 06.ogg ???: "Only Tamimi is still the same as before, always running off to places which you've been to."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzanmom 07.ogg ???: "Your teacher and friends came up with an idea to remodel Tamimi so it can search for you in our place."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzanmom 08.ogg ???: "You didn't like coming home back then, and would always get Tamimi to send a letter back. Now, we're leaving a letter with Tamimi. I wonder if it'll ever be delivered to you."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzanmom 09.ogg ???: "I don't know the answer to that question... But if you ever read this letter, I hope it'll be when you've already found your way home."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzanmom 10.ogg ???: "I regret not being able to say this to you myself, but I'll still feel sincerely happy for you, my dear daughter..."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: "Welcome home, Faruzan."
Media:vo frzcop001 tamimi upset 01.ogg Tamimi: Kolu...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: Look at you, Tamimi... you've changed so much after all these years. Thank you for waiting for me all this time.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: I've safely received the letters... Your work is done now. You can sleep.
Media:vo frzcop001 tamimi shutdown 01.ogg Tamimi: Ku...li...
 That's...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: Tamimi, the mechanical life form I encountered back then. When I would go on expeditions, it would follow me, take notes for me, and send my letters home.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: When I met with that accident, it was on the way to deliver a letter for me. I... I once thought that I'd never get to see it again.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: I didn't expect my teacher and others to remodel its Self-Repair function, upgrading it to "Self-Learning."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: And so, in order to plumb the depths of unknown ruins and overcome dangerous traps, it repaired and modified itself using parts it found along the way. One decade of wandering became many, and soon...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: Tamimi, which used to be incapable of even moving heavy objects, became the "Ruin Wanderer"...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: ...All so it could deliver these last letters from them to me.
 Even though they had all passed on...
 They still prayed for your safe return...
Tamimi: ...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: The strain to support such a huge body must have turned out to be too much for your "heart," right?
 ...Tamimi?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: Even after the remodeling, its "Restitution Module" still can't function perfectly in perpetuity. It has been pushing itself beyond its limits over the past few decades.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: Just like a living being, mechanical life forms have a limited lifespan. It probably became trapped in the ruins all those years ago because its shelf life had run out.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: It most likely only reactivated because it detected my presence... and then it mustered up everything it had to deliver that last letter. Now, it can finally rest in peace.
Tamimi: ...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 14.ogg Faruzan: Tighnari told you what happened to me, right?
 ...I'm sorry.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 15.ogg Faruzan: You don't have to apologize. It's not like this incident is a secret in the Akademiya.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 16.ogg Faruzan: Besides, I've always treated it as a failed experiment. As a researcher, I must accept this result.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 17.ogg Faruzan: However, finding out that so many people were affected by my failure... does make me feel somewhat conflicted.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 18.ogg Faruzan: Can you head back to Pardis Dhyai first? We've been here for a while, and it's best not to make Collei and the rest worry.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917314 faruzan 19.ogg Faruzan: As for me... I want to stay with Tamimi for a bit longer. Just a bit.
(Interact with Faruzan again, optional)
Faruzan: (Faruzan's head hangs low in silence... The desert breathes gales of wind, and the only sound that can be heard is the scattering rise of spreading grains.)
(Continue to Time to Decide)

Time to Decide[]

(Return to Pardis Dhyai and talk to Tighnari)
Media:vo frzcop001 karkata happy 01.ogg Karkata: Kolu!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917315 collei 01.ogg Collei: You're back!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917315 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: How was your journey through the desert? ...Wait. Where's Madam Faruzan?
 (Tell the whole truth...)
You tell everyone everything that happened in the desert...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917315 collei 02.ogg Collei: Oh no... She finally got to reunite with an old friend from 100 years ago, but...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917315 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: As a researcher, she could perhaps accept it. However, as a friend, student, and a daughter...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917315 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: We should give her some time. Let's just wait for her here.
Media:vo frzcop001 karkata upset 01.ogg Karkata: Kolu...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917315 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: And in the future... I hope that we can be here to support her as her new friends.
(Proceed to A Promise to the Future)
 (Keep Tamimi a secret...)
You tell everyone the partial truth...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917315 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: So Madam Faruzan has some other things to settle... Alright. And to think that Raed was doing all of those things on the sly. It's good that you all got out of that situation in one piece.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917315 collei 03.ogg Collei: Madam Faruzan will be able to repair Karkata when she gets back, won't she?
Media:vo frzcop001 karkata happy 01.ogg Karkata: Kolu!
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Currently, only Faruzan and I know about Tamimi...)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (I should let Faruzan decide whether to tell the others about Tamimi.)
(Proceed to Chat Under the Moonlight)
(Talk to Karkata again, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 karkata upset 01.ogg Karkata: Kolu...

A Promise to the Future[]
 Step DescriptionYou tell Tighnari and Collei everything, hoping that you will be able to comfort Faruzan...

(Wait until one day later)
(Enter Pardis Dhyai)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: I'm back! What, is there to be no welcoming party?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: ...We've all been waiting for you, Madam Faruzan.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: That's more like it. Now, here are some components I brought back from the desert. Switch these out with the ones Karkata is using right now, and it'll be back in ship shape!
 ...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: Hmm? Why do you all look so solemn? Come now, liveliness befits youngsters more.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 collei 01.ogg Collei: Madam Faruzan, did these parts come from...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: ...Heh.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: Come now, I thought that you must've encountered some major problem! This isn't something you have to worry about.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: Well, it looks like you already know everything... but no need to feel bad. Like I said before, as researchers, we must learn to accept our failures.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: Tamimi had been operating beyond capacity for a century, and I'm unable to repair it with my current abilities, not even with these parts. It would thus be much better to use them to extend Karkata's lifespan.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: As a senior, it is only right that I do something for the people who come after me. That holds true for both researchers and machines.
Media:vo frzcop001 karkata upset 01.ogg Karkata: Kolu...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: Besides, I didn't say that I would be giving you these parts for free. They will only be used for Karkata temporarily. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to help me with my research.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: I'll be sure to revive Tamimi once I've fully deciphered and replicated the creations of the ancient civilization.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: ...Alright, I'll do my best to help.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 collei 02.ogg Collei: Me too! Although I'm not sure if I'll be much help...
 I'll help, too.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: Thank you. If they could remodel Tamimi successfully even back then, there's no reason why we won't be able to do even better.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: When that day comes, I'll be sure to say...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917316 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: "Welcome home, Tamimi."

 Step DescriptionYou keep the issue about Tamimi to yourself until Faruzan returns from the desert...

(Wait until one day later)
(Enter Pardis Dhyai)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917317 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: I'm back! What, is there to be no welcoming party?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917317 collei 01.ogg Collei: Madam Faruzan, we're over here!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917317 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: That's more like it. Now, here are some components I brought back from the desert. Switch these out with the ones Karkata is using right now, and it'll be back in ship shape!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917317 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: So this is a relic of an ancient civilization? Unbelievable... Thankfully, it didn't end up in Raed's unscrupulous hands.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917317 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: Unscrupulous, huh? Hmm. Sounds like you already told them what happened.
 I told them about Raed.
 I told them about the archaeology team.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917317 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: Is that so...? Thank you. We will talk about everything else later.
Media:vo frzcop001 karkata doubt 01.ogg Karkata: Kulilu?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917317 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: It's nothing. I've already given all the evidence we have against Raed to the Akademiya. They're going to be very busy — too busy to bother us, I'd wager.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917317 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: I'll start repairing Karkata, then. Collei, can you help me out?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917317 collei 02.ogg Collei: O—Of course!
After some repairs, Karkata springs back to life...

 Step DescriptionFaruzan seems to be waiting for you...

(Talk to Tighnari again, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Faruzan went out after repairing Karkata. She seems to be looking for you for some reason.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: ...Well, I will not probe any further. However, if you need any help, do feel free to ask.
(Talk to Collei or Karkata again, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 karkata excite 01.ogg Karkata: Kalu! Kalu!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 collei 01.ogg Collei: It looks fine, but even so, it needs to properly rest up.
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Collei, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917301 collei 03.ogg Collei: (Will I be able to take Karkata with me on patrol duty in the future...?)
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Tighnari, optional)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917301 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: (Madam Faruzan seems to have a lot on her mind... Now's probably not the time to pry.)
(Talk to Faruzan)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Ah, you're here.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: Thank you for keeping Tamimi a secret.
 You don't plan on telling them?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: If I tell them about Tamimi, will they still feel happy for Karkata? Even if we could convince them to accept the components, they'll probably still feel bad about it.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: I don't want my past to affect people in the present. That applies to both me and other people.
 You don't have to shoulder all this alone.
 Maybe you'll feel better if you share it with the rest.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: It's fine. I'm used to this.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: I once believed that I'd never hear from my old friends and family ever again. Even their faces are getting hazier in my memories...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: However, I could remember them clearly again after reading the letter Tamimi handed to me and learning that they'd never given up on me. That's more than enough.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: I'd be disappointing them if I let myself fall into a slump because of this. Neither my teacher nor my mother would've wanted to see me like that.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: Besides, you're lending a listening ear to me now, aren't you?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: Oh, Pardis Dhyai looks pretty scenic at night. Will you take a stroll with me?
 It would be my pleasure.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: Once Karkata's condition stabilizes, I'll find a chance to tell Tighnari and Collei about all that.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: But for now, just help me keep this secret.
 You got it.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: Thank you. Hehe. Whether it's 100 years ago or now, I have people who worry about me.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 14.ogg Faruzan: I suppose I should consider myself quite fortunate.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 15.ogg Faruzan: The only time when I felt otherwise was when I had just returned to Sumeru. No one came to check up on me then. *sigh*
 ...
 Welcome home, Faruzan.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917318 faruzan 16.ogg Faruzan: ...

Behind His Back[]

(Approach the location)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 kazumasa 01.ogg Kazumasa: Haven't seen Thoma in a while... Who knows what that guy's working on these days?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 furusawa 01.ogg Furusawa: Probably something of the utmost importance, as ever... taking guests out for lavish meals, cleaning up around the house, the usual...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 kazumasa 02.ogg Kazumasa: We have people like that to thank for the decline of the samurai spirit in this day and age. If you're just gonna schmooze your way through every problem in life, you might as well put your blade on the scrap heap. It's like everything — use it or lose it!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 kazumasa 03.ogg Kazumasa: Also, I heard he's Mondstadt born and bred... just saying.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 furusawa 02.ogg Furusawa: Oh, well, no wonder. What do you think Miss Kamisato even sees in that guy?
 Time to put a stop to this...
 Let's leave them be...
Before you can respond, you hear footsteps coming up behind you...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: *yawn*... Sorry, haven't slept too well the last couple of days on account of all this rain we've been having.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Wait, what're you all doing here? Has something happened?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 kazumasa 04.ogg Kazumasa: Hmph... we were just having a little chat on our break. It's time we were going — there's still lots to do.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 kazumasa 05.ogg Kazumasa: We're busy people, Thoma. You'd do well to grow a sense of urgency, too.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Thank you gentlemen. I'll think about that when my vacation's over.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Sorry I'm a little late, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), something came up.
 You heard everything... didn't you?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Yep... I sure did.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: No big deal, though. People like to criticize those who don't fit in. It's the same everywhere.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: If a little private gossiping helps them let off some steam, well, good for them. It does no harm to the Kamisato Clan.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Wouldn't you agree?
 I agree. Let them do them, and you do you.
(Go to Branch 1)
 Sorry, I can't say I agree.
(Go to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 I agree. Let them do them, and you do you.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: Exactly. Or live and let live, as they say.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: Today it's time for a hard-earned rest. There's been so much to deal with since I got out of Komore Teahouse — this vacation's been a long time coming.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: There's too much going on here. Let's find somewhere more peaceful to discuss the plan for the day.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: You're still my guest, after all, and I'd like to hear your ideas.
(Proceed to Host's Invitation)

Branch 2[]

 Sorry, I can't say I agree.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: Oh?
 It makes me uncomfortable.
 We should tell them how much you do for the Commission.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: I'm touched that that's how you see the situation.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: I don't think we need to go down that route, though... in any case, as a housekeeper, it's hardly my place to get all high and mighty with other staff in the Yashiro Commission.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: But you're my guest and I live to serve, so if you have any other thoughts on the matter, please do share them with me.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 17.ogg Thoma: I'm willing to give anything you suggest a shot — as long as it's a serious suggestion, of course.
 (I'll ask around at the Yashiro Commission...)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 18.ogg Thoma: I'll be waiting for you right here. Just come and find me if you need anything.

Leisure Time[]

(Talk to Thoma)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: I haven't been to Ritou in a long time, but it feels like the place hasn't changed at all.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Then again, a long time for humans is a blink of an eye for the natural environment.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Makes me wonder... what is Mondstadt like these days?
 Wait, you've been to Mondstadt?
 You miss Mondstadt?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Yeah. I actually grew up there.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Later, my father moved back to Inazuma, and then we never heard from him. I wanted to take him some Dandelion Wine, so I took the boat here from Mondstadt.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Unfortunately, we hit a huge storm on the way, which sank the boat. I fell unconscious, but was somehow lucky enough to float the rest of the way to Inazuma on debris from the wreckage.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: I'll spare you the rest for now. Lemme take you around.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: This is a branch of the Chuyu Trading Company, based in Liyue. They sell ore from that region.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: I'm guessing you would have seen shops that look like this over there, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 Yes, I have.
 Actually, the ones in Liyue are a little fancier...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 qiuyue 01.ogg Qiuyue: Ah, hello there. What brings the two of you all the way out to Ritou today?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 qiuyue 02.ogg Qiuyue: Since you're here, you should pick out a special something. We've got some fantastic pieces in at the moment.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 qiuyue 03.ogg Qiuyue: Like this Noctilucous Jade Necklace, or this Cor Lapis Bracelet. They may not be top tier in terms of ore quality, but the craftsmanship is simply exquisite.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 qiuyue 04.ogg Qiuyue: Do either of them pique your interest?
 I quite like the necklace, but...
 Maybe the bracelet would suit me better?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: I think both suit you very nicely.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: To heck with it — how often do we get to do this? We'll take them both.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: But you've gotta be fair to us with the price, Ma'am. My friend here is actually from Liyue.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 qiuyue 05.ogg Qiuyue: Oh, really? Well, say no more, Thoma, I wouldn't dream of overcharging. How does this figure look to you?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911901 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: It looks very reasonable. Deal! Now, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), lemme take you somewhere else.

(Roam the streets with Thoma)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911902 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Back in its heyday, Ritou always used to remind me of Mondstadt...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911902 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Freedom of trade, freedom of culture, and freedom of lifestyle.

(Listen to Thoma's story about wine)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911903 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: This is Sailing Breeze, a purveyor of Mondstadt wines.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911903 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: As it turned out, one of the first things that greeted me here when I arrived wasn't my father, but wine from my hometown.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911903 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: It must be said though, the wines here aren't quite up to the Dawn Winery standard...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911903 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Back when my father was still in Mondstadt, he used to talk fondly of the Angel's Share.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911903 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Of course, I was still a kid back then, so I never did get to join him for a drink.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911903 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: And now that I'm actually old enough, the opportunity is gone...
 You'll get the chance one day.
 You'll have that drink one day.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911903 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: I hope so.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911903 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: You've been to Mondstadt, right? I assume you've been to the Angel's Share?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911903 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: I hear the owner's quite a formidable businessman. Given the chance, I'd love to meet him.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911903 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: When that day comes, we should also grab a drink... ah, wait, what am I saying. Maybe when you're older.

(Before "Transient Dreams")

(Roam the streets with Thoma)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911904 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Ritou's been going downhill ever since the Sakoku Decree took effect.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911904 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: The winds of freedom disappeared and a dark gloom took their place.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911904 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Ironically, though, it's that same gloom that really allows me to thrive here...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911904 kaede 01.ogg Kaede: Hi, Thoma. Out shopping with your friend? Can I get you anything today?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911904 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Why not — I'll take that Toy Fox.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911904 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: The Sakoku Decree has not been good for business.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911904 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Merchants have faced hostility at every turn. That's why the International Trade Association got together...
(After "Transient Dreams")

(Roam the streets with Thoma)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911904 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: I heard the Shogun recently abolished the Sakoku Decree, and trade and commerce is already starting to recover.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911904 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: I'm sure it won't be long before Ritou retrieves the prosperity of its past.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911904 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: This is also thanks to your hard work. Thanks to you, our nation can finally prosper.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911904 kaede 01.ogg Kaede: Hi, Thoma. Out shopping with your friend? Can I get you anything today?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911904 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Why not — I'll take that Toy Fox.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911904 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: The Sakoku Decree might have been abolished, but the International Trade Association is still going strong.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911904 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: After all, there are still plenty of situations where their help can be quite essential...

(Go to the International Trade Association entrance)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Here we are. Bet this takes you back, huh?
 I wonder how Kurisu's doing?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: I'm sure he's getting by. He wrote me not long ago, actually, asking me to deal with a situation for one of the merchants.
(Before "Transient Dreams")

Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Kurisu works tirelessly to maintain some sort of order within the business world, despite the entire industry being less than ideal.
(After "Transient Dreams")

Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 24.ogg Thoma: Now that the Sakoku Decree has ended, there's some disagreements within the International Trade Association. He's doing his best to mediate.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Must be tough for the guy. I hope everything gets back to normal as soon as possible...
 We spent quite an eventful time here.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: We sure did. Katsuie, from the Kanjou Commission, was persecuting those poor merchants, until you stepped in, of course.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: A lot of people in Ritou are still very grateful to you for that. They ask me about you sometimes.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: If you're interested, I could set up a meal for all of us if you'd like.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 keiichi 01.ogg Keiichi: Excuse me — Thoma?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 keiichi 02.ogg Keiichi: It is you! What a coincidence. I was just about to send someone to deliver a gift to you.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: I don't believe we've met? And if there's a gift involved here, I'm not sure I've earned it! Is there something I can do for you?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 keiichi 03.ogg Keiichi: No, no, you don't know me, but I've heard of you before.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 keiichi 04.ogg Keiichi: I ran into some trouble a while back, asked Kurisu for some help, and he said you were the one that resolved the situation.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 keiichi 05.ogg Keiichi: Kurisu is always telling us that repaying favors is all the more important for us as merchants.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 keiichi 06.ogg Keiichi: If you're on the receiving end of someone's kindness, you can't let it go unacknowledged. So, I tried to pick out something that I thought you might like...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: Something... you thought I might like?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 keiichi 07.ogg Keiichi: That's right! So here it is — some confectionery from Yumeno Tennenan, a fine purveyor of Inazuman delicacies. Each one costs a small fortune.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 keiichi 08.ogg Keiichi: I thought this would be the only fitting way to repay someone of your stature!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 keiichi 09.ogg Keiichi: Not to mention that the value of your assistance far outweighs the value of my gift.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 keiichi 10.ogg Keiichi: Do you like it?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: ...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Haha, I don't know how you did it, but you managed to cater to my tastes perfectly.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: I humbly accept your gift. Keep up the good work in your line of business, and if you have any further problems, feel free to come find me.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 keiichi 11.ogg Keiichi: I will! Thanks again, Thoma!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 keiichi 12.ogg Keiichi: I'll leave you in peace now. Have a good day!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: You too, goodbye.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: Pretty high-energy guy, huh.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: You wanna try, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? This store is indeed renowned in Inazuma. In fact, demand is so high that it's very difficult to come by their products.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: They're all handmade by top chefs, and the flavor is as authentic as it gets.
 Tastes pretty good.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 17.ogg Thoma: Great, I'm glad you like it.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 18.ogg Thoma: I'll see about trying to make my own when I get the chance. They're made to a traditional family recipe though, so replicating them won't be easy.
 Your cooking is better.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 19.ogg Thoma: Haha... you flatter me.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 20.ogg Thoma: The store is at least a few decades old, and the chefs who make these have been at it their whole lives. Not sure my ability is on par with that...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 21.ogg Thoma: But if you're happy to be my taste-tester on a regular-enough basis, maybe one day I'll be able to reach their level.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 22.ogg Thoma: Okay, that about wraps up our nostalgia trip to the International Trade Association. I think we've just seen about everything there is to see in the city.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911905 thoma 23.ogg Thoma: Let's keep heading this way. We don't get to hang out all that often — it'd be a shame to head back so soon.

(Roam the streets with Thoma)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911906 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: With the change of seasons, Ritou gives me a different feeling each time I come.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911906 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Hmm... maybe it's not entirely to do with the seasons. Anyway, the main point is, I'm happy to be here with you this time.

(Talk to Thoma)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: I come to this place every time I visit Ritou.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: The view here isn't as spectacular as on Narukami Island, but if you're looking for a relaxing spot, you can't beat this one.
(Before "Transient Dreams")

Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: I believe that the Sakoku Decree will be repealed one day, and this place will flourish again like it did in the old days.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: When the winds of freedom finally blow away the gloom... I think I'll have to ask milady for a long vacation, so I can take a trip back home.
(After "Transient Dreams")

Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 27.ogg Thoma: And I'm sure it'll be bustling with life again soon enough now that the Sakoku Decree's been abolished.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 28.ogg Thoma: Once I'm on top of things, I think I'll have to ask milady for a long vacation, so I can take a trip back home. I don't see that happening anytime soon, though... I have a long list of things to get through.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Alright, time to call it a day. Let's head back.
 Hold on.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Hmm? Not ready to leave yet?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: Come to think of it, I do have a couple more places I could take you...
 I have a gift for you, too.
 I want to repay your kindness, too.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Haha, there's no need for that.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: The whole reason I took you out was to thank you for all the help you gave us during the Vision Hunt Decree.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: As long as you enjoyed yourself, that's all I could ask for. You don't have to give me a gift.
 But I think you'll like it.
 It's nothing expensive.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Really? Okay, well now I'm excited!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: Oh my... it's...
 A Windwheel Aster.
 A little something from Mondstadt.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: ...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: This really... I wasn't expecting this.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: I'm a little lost for words... This gift is... invaluable.
 It didn't cost anything...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: I know, but I don't mean its material value. I'm talking about its value to me specifically.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 17.ogg Thoma: Let me put it this way. The confectionery I received from that merchant earlier — thoughtful gift, don't get me wrong, but at the end of the day, I know it's mostly transactional.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 18.ogg Thoma: I helped him out, so it's standard procedure for him to get a gift for me in return. Also, he picked a brand of fancy confectionery that he thought would meet me at my level, and make it easier for him to approach me with any future requests.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 19.ogg Thoma: If you lend Mora to someone, you can guarantee that any gift you receive in return will have been chosen according to its material value.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 20.ogg Thoma: But the gift you just gave me can't be weighed in the same terms.
 I'm just glad you like it.
 I don't want anything in return.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 21.ogg Thoma: Okay, well... at least take this in return.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 22.ogg Thoma: It's an omamori I always carry with me. Again, nothing expensive.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 23.ogg Thoma: But it can bring the bearer good luck... seriously, I'm not making that up. My father told me.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 24.ogg Thoma: He gave it to my mom, and she gave it to me just before I came to Inazuma.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 25.ogg Thoma: Who knows, maybe this omamori was the only reason I survived the storm and made it to Inazuma in the first place.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911907 thoma 26.ogg Thoma: Whatever the truth of it is, I'd like you to have it.
(Obtain  Lucky Omamori)

 Quest DescriptionThe young thaumaturge Chongyun has obtained a great amount of (rather unreliable-sounding) information concerning evil spirits, but you decide not to expose this fact out of courtesy. The way Chongyun sees it, the most likely spot for evil spirits to show up is Wuwang Hill, where a Test of Courage is currently taking place. The test requires two people to go in together, so you accept his invitation and accompany him there...
To Take a Test of Courage[]

(Talk to Uncle Jia)
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 unclejia 01.ogg Uncle Jia: Please be careful, everyone. Pay close attention to your surroundings and stay vigilant once you enter.
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 unclejia 02.ogg Uncle Jia: And most importantly, don't get separated from your partner and wander off on your own. You'll most certainly be in for a scare if you go alone.
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: Did you hear that? He's warning the event participants. Maybe something strange really did happen here...
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: Let's investigate.
 (I think you misunderstood that...)
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 unclejia 03.ogg Uncle Jia: Hehe, welcome to the Test of Courage! You two must be very close friends.
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: Actually, we just met...
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 unclejia 04.ogg Uncle Jia: Hah, no problem at all. Don't be shy, just enjoy yourselves!
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 unclejia 05.ogg Uncle Jia: But please drink this before you enter the Test of Courage.
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 unclejia 06.ogg Uncle Jia: This drink will boost the yang energy inside your body and lift your courage.
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 unclejia 07.ogg Uncle Jia: Not only that, but this drink will also allow you to see things which are usually hidden from the naked eye... Pretty exciting, huh?
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: Y—Yang energy?
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 unclejia 08.ogg Uncle Jia: That's right. Ghosts are said to be full of "yin energy," so more "yang energy" will surely deter them.
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: Whoa, I've never heard of such a drink. Is it a secret recipe, or maybe some kind of potion?
 Perhaps it's all just psychological.
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: Hmm, possibly... But why bother exaggerating it so much then?
 I think you've misunderstood the whole "Test of Courage" thing.
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: Surely not, he keeps emphasizing that there are frightening things inside. I'm almost certain it's some powerful evil spirit.
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: But if this drink really does boost yang energy, then it's potentially dangerous for me.
 Dangerous?
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: *sigh* You see, I have a very rare constitution called a "pure-yang spirit."
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: Such a constitution allows me to scare away evil spirits, but also makes me prone to emotional impulses.
 You seem like a very calm person to me.
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 chongyun 11.ogg Chongyun: I am constantly focusing to keep my mind and body in a normal state, which usually works until I suffer from some external stress...
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 unclejia 09.ogg Uncle Jia: Come now, what's with that serious expression on your face, lad? You aren't worried about the drink, are you?
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 unclejia 10.ogg Uncle Jia: It's delicious and quite effective if I do say so myself! There's nothing to worry about.
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 unclejia 11.ogg Uncle Jia: Or if you're still unsure, perhaps only one of you could take the drink. The person who takes the drink can protect the one who doesn't. It'll be exciting either way!
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 chongyun 12.ogg Chongyun: Hmm, it's hard to refuse when you put it that way...
 Let's both drink it. If you lose control, I'll be sure to take care of you. (Unlocks Sudden Discomfort and The Bottom of Things)
 Just let me drink it alone. (Unlocks Ever Deeper)
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 unclejia 12.ogg Uncle Jia: Alright, here it is! Please drink it slowly.
After finishing the drink...
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 unclejia 13.ogg Uncle Jia: Haha! Yes, that's it, you did great! You two may enter now.

Unsettling Feeling/Chongyun's Determination[]

(If Chongyun also drank the drink)
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 chongyun 15.ogg Chongyun: I'm starting to feel something after that drink...
Media:vo cycop001 1903001 chongyun 16.ogg Chongyun: Uh — no, no, I'll be fine... Let's go investigate the area.
(Approach the site of the Test of Courage)
Media:vo cycop001 1903002 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: So, this is the Test of Courage! Hmm, there are more people here than I imagined.
Media:vo cycop001 1903002 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: They could all be in grave danger if there really is an evil spirit here. We must get to the bottom of this!
Media:vo cycop001 1903002 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: I'm not too sure where we should start, but I know we'll find something once we start looking.
Media:vo cycop001 1903002 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: These innocent participants are completely oblivious to the potential danger here. We'll need to protect them.
 The Test of Courage isn't actually dangerous, you know.
Media:vo cycop001 1903002 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: Wh—What? Please, enlighten me.
 The participants are just here to have fun.
Media:vo cycop001 1903002 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: You mean, being scared is like "entertainment" to them?
 You're taking this event too seriously.
Media:vo cycop001 1903002 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: I see... *sigh* Maybe you're right. I'm certainly a stranger to entertainment, after all.
Media:vo cycop001 1903002 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: I mostly spend my time purging evil spirits and practicing thaumaturgy.
Media:vo cycop001 1903002 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: Besides training, I also need to constantly focus on my own emotions to avoid losing control.
Media:vo cycop001 1903002 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: So I rarely have any time for leisure activities. I'm completely unfamiliar with what others would consider entertainment.
 I see...
Media:vo cycop001 1903002 chongyun 11.ogg Chongyun: Hm... Well, either way, let's check the area for any evil spirits, just in case. Where should we start?
(Look around for any sign of evil spirits)

Lu Zheng and Dandan[]

(Talk to Lu Zheng)
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 dandan 01.ogg Dandan: This is all your fault! This place nearly scared me to death!
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 luzheng 01.ogg Lu Zheng: Alright, alright, don't lose your temper. We're leaving now, okay?
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 luzheng 02.ogg Lu Zheng: Hmm... To think I used to believe you were brave.
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 dandan 02.ogg Dandan: B—But this is different!
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: Excuse me, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation. Did you perchance encounter an evil spirit?
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: If so, I'm here to track it. Could you please tell me which direction it went?
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 dandan 03.ogg Dandan: Wh—Who are you?
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 dandan 04.ogg Dandan: No I didn't see anything, so don't ask!
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 dandan 05.ogg Dandan: So please just leave me alone. I don't know what you're talking about, and I certainly don't want anything to do with an evil spirit.
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: My apologies, perhaps you misunderstood what I meant. I only wish to know what the spirit looks like and which way it went so we could track it down.
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: If you can't describe its appearance, then at least show us the way it went.
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 dandan 06.ogg Dandan: Sh—Show you the way? No, I'm not going anywhere!
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: N—No, we're not taking you anywhere. I am just asking you to show us—
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 dandan 07.ogg Dandan: Ugh, no, forget it!
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 luzheng 03.ogg Lu Zheng: Alright, that's enough. Listen, if you keep talking like that, she might actually end up believing in that nonsense.
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 luzheng 04.ogg Lu Zheng: Can't you see she's terrified enough already? You can go find whatever strange things you're looking for on your own.
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: My apologies, I didn't mean to frighten her.
 He's quite the serious exorcist.
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: Yes, I'm just trying to hunt the evil spirit you mentioned to prevent it from hurting anyone.
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 luzheng 05.ogg Lu Zheng: Isn't it a bit strange for an exorcist to come to the Test of Courage looking for evil spirits?
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 luzheng 06.ogg Lu Zheng: Oh... I think I get it now. But we didn't say anything about a ghost or spirit. I think you misunderstood us.
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 luzheng 07.ogg Lu Zheng: I brought my girlfriend here to have some fun, but instead, she got frightened by all this spooky atmosphere. Now we'll just have to go home.
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 luzheng 08.ogg Lu Zheng: *sigh* I'm not too sure what you're looking for, but we did see some dark shadows making strange noises.
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: Thank you very much. That's very helpful.
The couple leaves.
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: Well, you heard it. It seems something unusual is going on here.
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: But why would they ever want to come here if they get scared so easily?
 The point isn't getting scared, it's relying on each other in the face of fear.
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 chongyun 11.ogg Chongyun: Interesting... I have never had any fear of evil spirits, so perhaps I'm unable to understand their feelings.
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 chongyun 12.ogg Chongyun: It's amazing that you're able to pick up on that. Good thing I brought you as my partner!
Media:vo cycop001 1903003 chongyun 13.ogg Chongyun: Anyway, let's keep searching the area.

Strange Smoke[]

(Interact with the Strange Smoke)
Media:vo cycop001 1903004 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: Hmm, these are traces left by an evil spirit, no doubt about it!
Media:vo cycop001 1903004 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: The traces are quite weak, though, so there are only two possibilities. Either the spirit that left the traces is very weak, or it has already left for some time now.
Media:vo cycop001 1903004 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: Either way, these possibilities prove my hunch that there's indeed an evil spirit here.
 Are evil spirits the reason why Wuwang Hill is so gloomy all the time?
Media:vo cycop001 1903004 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: No, I don't think so. There have been many rumors regarding the cause of Wuwang Hill's gloomy aura, but nothing is certain.
Media:vo cycop001 1903004 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: Although, once it became the murky place you see now, it also began to attract more evil spirits.
Media:vo cycop001 1903004 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: Anyway, these traces lead us one step closer to finding an evil spirit.

Junjun and Chan'er[]

(Talk to Junjun)
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chaner 01.ogg Chan'er: Don't come over here again!
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chaner 02.ogg Chan'er: Seriously, just leave me alone!
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 junjun 01.ogg Junjun: Why must you be so obstinate?
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 junjun 02.ogg Junjun: Just calm down! It's not what you think.
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chaner 03.ogg Chan'er: No, don't even bother! You think I don't know what you're doing?
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: Stop! Not a step closer!
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: Don't be afraid! I'll exorcise it right now!
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 junjun 03.ogg Junjun: Exorcise it?
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chaner 04.ogg Chan'er: Wh—Who are you? And what are you talking about?
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: Wait? What?
 Everyone, just calm down.
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: Oh, he's just a person? Ah, it seems I've made a mistake.
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: After seeing her resist so violently, I thought for sure an evil spirit was trying to harm her.
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 junjun 04.ogg Junjun: Nah, it's not like that at all! She's just... throwing a tantrum.
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chaner 05.ogg Chan'er: Excuse me? A "tantrum"? This is supposed to be a date, you know?
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chaner 06.ogg Chan'er: And now that we're finally here, you don't wanna go anywhere, and you just wanna hang around the entrance. What's the point in that?
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 junjun 05.ogg Junjun: Alright, fine! I was just about to walk in with you...
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 junjun 06.ogg Junjun: Look, I—I'm sorry, I'm just a little bit scared, that's all. That's why I've been stalling. I was wrong, okay?
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 junjun 07.ogg Junjun: Now that someone else is here, let's take a moment to calm down.
 They seem to be here to participate just like everyone else.
 I think we're intruding on them.
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: *sigh* I wasn't thinking clearly. It was pure impulse...
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 junjun 08.ogg Junjun: I'm sorry, p—please forgive me. Will you give me another chance?
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chaner 07.ogg Chan'er: ...Fine... I know that I shouldn't have yelled at you.
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 junjun 09.ogg Junjun: Oh... It doesn't matter anymore. You're still the best, babe.
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chaner 08.ogg Chan'er: Uh, who said you could call me "babe"? Ugh, you're so annoying!
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: Huh, so they really are on a date? But why in such a dangerous place like this?
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: ...Perhaps we should just leave them alone.
(Talk to Junjun again)
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 junjun 10.ogg Junjun: If not "babe," then... how about "darling"?
Media:vo cycop001 1903005 chaner 09.ogg Chan'er: Hmph, don't you try to sweet talk me!

Proceeding Onward[]

(Approach the designated location)
(If you drank the potion alone)

Media:vo cycop001 1903201 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: *sigh* Well, at least we've found some useful clues. We'll need to keep searching further in.
Media:vo cycop001 1903201 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: But to avoid alerting the evil spirit, perhaps I should wait here.
 You're not coming?
Media:vo cycop001 1903201 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: When we were collecting clues just now, we were still unsure whether any evil spirit is actually here or not. But now that possibility seems higher, it would be wise to proceed more cautiously.
Media:vo cycop001 1903201 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: Our efforts will be wasted if my yang energy scares the evil spirit away.
Media:vo cycop001 1903201 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: Besides, I trust your capability and experience as an adventurer.
Media:vo cycop001 1903201 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: If you come across a powerful demon, I'll get there as fast as possible.
 Just wait for my word.
Media:vo cycop001 1903201 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: Alright, thank you.
(Go to Ever Deeper)
(If Chongyun also drank the potion)

Media:vo cycop001 1903006 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: ...Sorry... Sorry, I feel... unwell.
Media:vo cycop001 1903006 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: ...I think the drink we had earlier stirred the yang energy inside my body.
 Is it that serious?
Media:vo cycop001 1903006 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: If there's too much yang energy, I'm afraid that I won't be able to control myself. Even though you were willing to accompany me this far, I don't want to cause you any further trouble.
 But we've finally found some traces of an evil spirit.
Media:vo cycop001 1903006 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: If I lose control, I fear that I'll be the one endangering everyone here, not evil spirits. ...We'd better find somewhere to rest.
 Sure, just have a rest. I'll continue investigating on my own.
Media:vo cycop001 1903006 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: Alright. You are an experienced adventurer, after all. I won't be far, so just call for help if you run into any danger.
(Go to The Bottom of Things)
 Let me help you find a place to rest.
Media:vo cycop001 1903006 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: Ugh... sorry to trouble you again...
You find a place for Chongyun to rest.
Media:vo cycop001 1903006 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: Ughhh...
 Is there anything I can do to help?
Media:vo cycop001 1903006 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: The feeling... it's becoming more intense...
Media:vo cycop001 1903006 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: Usually, I can manage by simply eating a popsicle... but that's only under normal circumstances...
Media:vo cycop001 1903006 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: I may need something... a bit more potent in this case...
Media:vo cycop001 1903006 chongyun 11.ogg Chongyun: Like Cryo Slime Condensate, or Cryo Whopperflower Nectar, for example...
 I think I have some.
Media:vo cycop001 1903006 chongyun 12.ogg Chongyun: You've collected these during your adventures right? But I'm afraid they're no good... They're not fresh enough.
Media:vo cycop001 1903006 chongyun 13.ogg Chongyun: Perhaps they're fine as typical ingredients, but they won't be potent enough to suppress the abundance of yang energy inside me.
 I'll go get some Cryo Slime Condensate for you. (Unlocks Cryo Slime Condensate Recipe)
 I'll go get some Cryo Whopperflower Nectar for you. (Unlocks Cryo Whopperflower Recipe)
Media:vo cycop001 1903006 chongyun 14.ogg Chongyun: Thank you... I'll be resting here.
Media:vo cycop001 1903006 chongyun 15.ogg Chongyun: ...I should be able to manage for the time being if I... just focus on keeping calm.
(Go to Sudden Discomfort)

Gang Bylaws[]
 Quest DescriptionHaving heard that Shinobu is about to implement some special Gang Bylaws, Mamoru and the others flee as quickly as they can...

(Upon reaching the location)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914301 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Hmm? That's the owner of Aisa Bathhouse. What's he looking at?
(Aikawa Susumu Idle line)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914301 aikawasusumu 01.ogg Aikawa Susumu: What was that...?
(Talk to Matsumoto)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914301 matsumoto 01.ogg Matsumoto: Did I see anyone come by this way? Sorry, I was concentrating on my lemon water tasting...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914301 matsumoto 02.ogg Matsumoto: Your best bet would probably be to ask someone at the bathhouse across the road.
(Talk to Aikawa Susumu)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914301 aikawasusumu 02.ogg Aikawa Susumu: I was just doing some cleaning when I suddenly heard a loud noise outside.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914301 aikawasusumu 03.ogg Aikawa Susumu: I got to the door just in time to see a shadowy figure disappear up that tree!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914301 aikawasusumu 04.ogg Aikawa Susumu: This is a busy street... Surely it wouldn't be a burglar, would it...?

(Mamoru idle line)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 mamoru 01.ogg Mamoru: Please don't see me, please don't see me...
(Talk to Mamoru)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Come on, get up. What are you crouching there for?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 mamoru 02.ogg Mamoru: Eek! ...Shinobu, what are you doing up here...?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 aikawasusumu 01.ogg Aikawa Susumu: Hey! What do you think you're doing, climbing up on someone else's roof?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Oh... Sorry, coming down.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 aikawasusumu 02.ogg Aikawa Susumu: *sigh* If you're gonna horse around, fine — but you have to know when to rein it in, okay?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 aikawasusumu 03.ogg Aikawa Susumu: It's darn lucky that you didn't break any roof tiles. Otherwise, I'd have to close the place down while I get it fixed...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 mamoru 03.ogg Mamoru: S—Sorry!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: We're very sorry. I will be much stricter with him in the future.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: If, on closer inspection, you do find any damage, please come to Hanamizaka and ask for me. The Arataki Gang will bear the cost of repairs.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 aikawasusumu 04.ogg Aikawa Susumu: It's okay, all's well that ends well. It's just, if you carry on like this, causing mischief day after day, night after night... Sooner or later, accidents are gonna happen.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 aikawasusumu 05.ogg Aikawa Susumu: I can see that you're a reasonable person. For your own sake, find a way to keep your subordinates in line.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I will. Thank you for understanding.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: For the sake of both the Arataki Gang and the community, I will get them to start behaving themselves as a matter of urgency.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 mamoru 04.ogg Mamoru: Uh, hehe, we'll do better, we promise!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Listen carefully. From now on, you must strictly abide by the Gang Bylaws of the Arataki Gang.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 08.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Gang Bylaws, Article 1: Do not damage other people's property.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 09.ogg Kuki Shinobu: In case of violation, the member shall compensate the victim for their full losses, including the cost of repairs, lost business hours, and — depending on the situation — compensation for emotional distress.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 10.ogg Kuki Shinobu: If the offending member cannot immediately afford to pay the compensation, the Arataki Gang will extend to the member a loan for the full sum, on the condition that they take on paid employment and repay the loan within an agreed time period. Including interest, of course.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 11.ogg Kuki Shinobu: As a further security, all of the offending member's gang assets, including Onikabuto and Genius Invokation TCG cards, will be frozen until the loan is repaid in full...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 mamoru 05.ogg Mamoru: No... No! I'm sorry, I get it now, I promise!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 12.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Good — then no more violations in the future. Now, where are Genta and Akira?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 mamoru 06.ogg Mamoru: Uh... Boss said that a fellow gang member is a brother from another mother, and we should never betray the brotherly bond...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 13.ogg Kuki Shinobu: If they've violated the Gang Bylaws and you're withholding knowledge of their whereabouts, you'll be punished as an accomplice along with them.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 mamoru 07.ogg Mamoru: Hanamizaka, they went to Hanamizaka! I saw with my own eyes!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 14.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Let's go, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). I hope they haven't caused any trouble.
(After finding Mamoru)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 mamoru 08.ogg Mamoru: Shinobu, you can see I've learned my lesson for real this time. So maybe...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 15.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Shut up and get a move on. If you try and run away again, you'll only have yourself to blame for the consequences.

(Souta idle line)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914304 sota 01.ogg Souta: What are we gonna do...
(Talk to the children)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914304 sota 02.ogg Souta: What are we gonna do? Do we really have to give up on playing Genius Invokation today?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914304 eita 01.ogg Eita: We could try playing somewhere else. But where else apart from under the bridge can we escape from the grown-ups?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914304 sota 03.ogg Souta: Oh, I know! We can get Yoimiya to set off some fireworks and scare off the guy that took our spot!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914304 eita 02.ogg Eita: That's kinda mean... Although, he kicked us out first...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914304 sota 04.ogg Souta: Yeah, so it's his own fault!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914304 yuma 01.ogg Yuma: I think... maybe we should just go home and do our homework?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914304 yuma 02.ogg Yuma: People who spend all their time playing and never studying turn into the kind of grown-ups who hang out under brigdes, too...
(Genta; idle line)

Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Why are you still hiding here? Come on out.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 genta 02.ogg Genta: Oh, uh... I... Shinobu...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 sota 01.ogg Souta: Whoa! The guy who stole our spot, he came out!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Ugh... Sorry, we're coming up.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 genta 03.ogg Genta: ...I'm sorry! I shouldn't have stolen your spot! Well, at least, not without a fair fight first...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 genta 04.ogg Genta: Um, l—lemme make it up to you! As punishment, I'll play a game of Genius Invokation with you...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 mamoru 01.ogg Mamoru: Huh? Cool, count me in! In the Arataki Gang, the victor shares the spoils... No, wait — brothers share our burdens! So, uh, punish us together!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 sota 02.ogg Souta: Ummm... I dunno, maybe not...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 eita 01.ogg Eita: It's so noisy over here, the grown-ups will definitely find us...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 eita 02.ogg Eita: If they find out that we came out to play cards before finishing our homework, we'll never be allowed to play again.
 These kids have more self-control than some people...
 Unlike some people, these kids know when enough is enough...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 yuma 01.ogg Yuma: Besides, if we never do our homework and play Genius Invokation all the time...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 yuma 02.ogg Yuma: ...We'll probably turn into big losers when we grow up.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 sota 03.ogg Souta: Huh? Seriously? You mean like... this guy!?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 eita 03.ogg Eita: Oh brother — quick, let's get back and do our homework!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 genta 05.ogg Genta: Hey, you little rascals!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Stop. Leave them alone, they're just kids.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Gang Bylaws, Article 2: No bullying of small children.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 genta 06.ogg Genta: Bylaws? What are they?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 mamoru 02.ogg Mamoru: Never mind that, just listen!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...Violators must give a sincere and unreserved apology to the victim and make amends.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Until such a time as the victim forgives the violator, they will be banned from participating in all gang activities, including Lavender Melon roasting sessions, The Great Singalong, Onikabuto battles... and Genius Invokation TCG.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 genta 07.ogg Genta: Nooooo!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Don't pretend to be the victim here. Tell me, where is Akira?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 genta 08.ogg Genta: Uhh... B—Boss said that homies are family, and family don't rat each other out... especially not to Shinobu...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 shinobu 08.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Go on?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 genta 09.ogg Genta: He was heading out of the city! I saw it with my own eyes!
 Why do I get the feeling this happens all the time...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 genta 10.ogg Genta: When Shinobu gives me the look, I react automatically, I can't control it...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 mamoru 03.ogg Mamoru: Ahem! As members of the Arataki Gang, we brothers share our burdens! If that means getting taught a lesson, then we take it as a team!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 shinobu 09.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Out of the city? A Doushin from the Police Station told me that things have been getting pretty rough out there recently...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 shinobu 10.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Let's go, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Hopefully we can catch up with him.
(After finding Genta)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 genta 11.ogg Genta: Hey, uh, how did Shinobu find me so quickly? Mamoru... did you—
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 mamoru 04.ogg Mamoru: Aw geez, I'm just so worried about Akira, you know? He could be in real trouble! Quick, we gotta catch up with him!

(Approach the location)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914307 mamoru 01.ogg Mamoru: *panting* I swear I've never known Akira to run so fast before...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914307 genta 01.ogg Genta: I can't keep going... I think I'm actually gonna die... Phew...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914307 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...
 Is something on your mind?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914307 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I heard from the Police Station about a group of Kairagi on the prowl outside the city...
 He'd still have to be very unlucky...
 The odds of Akira running into them are pretty low.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914307 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...Ugh, well anyway, the best we can do is find him as soon as possible.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914307 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: There's a lot of terrain to cover here. I think we might have to split up, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914307 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I'll get Mamoru and Genta somewhere safe and tell them to stay put. Then... I'll go south, you go north?
 Sure thing.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914307 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Thanks.
(Talk to Kuki Shinobu)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914307 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Alright you two, stay here, you understand? No running off.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914307 mamoru 02.ogg Mamoru: You can count on that... We ain't going anywhere right now...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914307 shinobu 08.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Yes, I can see that. But you'd better not change your mind once you've caught your breath.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914307 genta 02.ogg Genta: We won't! Never again!

All the Way North[]

(Approach Akira)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 01.ogg Akira: Hmm... I wonder if I can hide in this box...
 Whatcha looking at?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 02.ogg Akira: Huh? Ah, Shinobu! Please, have mercy...
 Shinobu isn't here.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 03.ogg Akira: Huh? Wheeew... You scared the heck out of me.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 04.ogg Akira: I was so sure she'd be with you... Boy, this is lucky.
 What are you doing here?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 05.ogg Akira: Hehe, I closed my eyes and just ran and ran, then I tripped and fell, and this is where I ended up...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 06.ogg Akira: And what do you know, it's the perfect hiding place! Even comes with these huge boxes...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 07.ogg Akira: If I can squeeze myself inside one of them, Shinobu will never find me!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 08.ogg Akira: ...Ah, don't sell me out, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! Boss said our gang is our clan, and—
 Yeah, I know, I know.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 09.ogg Akira: Ah, nice! So you know how we roll, hehe!
 Well, I'm not a member of the gang.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 10.ogg Akira: Ahem, well... friends should look out for each other too!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 11.ogg Akira: Anyway... please help me empty out one of these boxes...
 Shinobu said it's not safe around here.
 Kairagi might show up.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 12.ogg Akira: Kairagi? Wait a second, this sounds like Shinobu trying to scare me out of hiding...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 13.ogg Akira: Hmm... Even if it's not, I still feel like I'd rather face a bunch of Kairagi than an angry Shinobu...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 14.ogg Akira: I ran so far this time, Shinobu's gonna be furious with me... Yeah, I think I'd better stay in hiding for a while...
 No, come with me. I'll make sure Shinobu goes easy on you.
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 Fine, if she scares you that much, lemme help you hide...
(Proceed to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 No, come with me. I'll make sure Shinobu goes easy on you.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 15.ogg Akira: Y—You will? ...How do I know you mean that?
 Because you're my brother from another mother.
 Because homies are family.
 Because our gang is our clan.
 And my word is my bond.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 16.ogg Akira: I guess with you there, maybe Shinobu really will let me off this time...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 17.ogg Akira: Okay... I'll come with you. I'm putting my life in your hands here!
You and Akira climb up the mountain...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 18.ogg Akira: Shinobu!?
 Oh... That's unexpected...
 How come you're here?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I finished searching the south and noticed you hadn't returned, so I came to see what was up on your end.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Looks like I was just in time.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 19.ogg Akira: Help me, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! You promised!
 I... uh...
 Shinobu...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Relax, I'm not going to do anything.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 20.ogg Akira: Shinobu, spare me... Huh? Did I hear you right?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: We go through this song and dance every day. Even an omnipresent god would have a tough time keeping track of you all.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Besides, even when I teach you a lesson, it's not long before you're up to your usual antics again.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 21.ogg Akira: Hehe, in the Arataki Gang, we call that being too legit to quit!
 Dude. Not now.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: From now on, we will be using the Gang Bylaws of the Arataki Gang as the new disciplinary tool.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I've got the basics thought out already. Once it's finished, it'll be time for class.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 shinobu 08.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Mamoru and Genta are waiting for you at Hanamizaka. You can make a study group and test each other on the rules.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 22.ogg Akira: Wait, what? Are you serious? (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), help!
 Come on, it's not that bad.
 A little learning isn't going to be fatal.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 23.ogg Akira: Ugh... I'm a member of the Arataki Gang, I ain't about to waste my life studying and doing homework!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 24.ogg Akira: I'm outta here!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 shinobu 09.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Huh? Gang Bylaws, Article 3: Insubordination shall be punished by making the member recite all the bylaws from memory!
(Proceed to That'll Learn Them!)

Branch 2[]

 Fine, if she scares you that much, lemme help you hide...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 25.ogg Akira: Thanks!
Akira tries to squeeze himself into a box...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 26.ogg Akira: Why is there so much stuff in here? It's so cramped...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 27.ogg Akira: Ah, shoot! There goes the flyers...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 28.ogg Akira: Whew, finally made it...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 29.ogg Akira: But now there are flyers everywhere...
 They're visible from outside the box.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 30.ogg Akira: Well, can't do anything about it now. Can you go back and see what Shinobu's up to, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 31.ogg Akira: I need to figure out how long I need to lie low before she calms down...
(Proceed to Temporary Escape)
(Talk to Akira)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914801 akira 01.ogg Akira: It's so cramped in here... I hope Shinobu cools down soon...

A Breather[]

(After Maid-in-Training or directly starting from menu)
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Are there any particular snacks you like? I can get started with —
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: ...Oh, no need? I should take a break...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Oh, okay then... In that case, let's head to Good Hunter and have a look...

(Approach Good Hunter)
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 01.ogg Beatrice: Noelle—
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: B—Bea...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: What happened? Is there something I can help you with?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 02.ogg Beatrice: Quinn! He's ignoring me again...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Take your time, no rush. I'm here to help.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 03.ogg Beatrice: I... *whimpers* ...noticed Quinn was in a bad mood, so I wanted to call him over for a chat...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 04.ogg Beatrice: And... a date, I guess.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Oh? A d—date...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: So it's... that kind of problem?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 05.ogg Beatrice: Yes! I've been over to him several times today already...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 06.ogg Beatrice: But no matter how I try to make conversation, he just focuses on his stall and ignores me completely!
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 07.ogg Beatrice: Noelle, everyone in Mondstadt thinks you're really cute...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 08.ogg Beatrice: You must be really popular, right? Can you help me out...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Ah! Of... of course! It's a maid's responsibility to help the residents of Mondstadt!
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: It's just... I... I don't have any experience in this area...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 09.ogg Beatrice: *sigh* ...Even Noelle can't help me...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Please, don't worry! I... Oh! We also have the Honorary Knight here!
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Honorary Knight... can you help Bea?
 Didn't we say we were going to take a break?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: I—I'm so sorry!
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: But as a maid of Favonius, I can't stand idly by when people are in need.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: I'll do some serious planning and make sure we can have a day off together another time!
 So even a break requires serious planning...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: Indeed. But today... can you help Bea come up with a solution?
 Well, if you insist...
 I'll certainly do my best...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: Oh! Thank you!
 Let's analyze the situation first...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: Okay! Bea said that Quinn always seems busy and ignores everything she says...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: But... I know that she's often looking for small talk with Quinn...
 Maybe the frequent small talk...
 ...So Quinn feels that Bea has nothing important to say to him...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 20.ogg Noelle: That's... a possibility!
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 21.ogg Noelle: In other words... we just need to make Quinn realize that this time is different.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 22.ogg Noelle: For example... by sending him a little gift. Even Quinn would realize the difference a gift would bring!
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 23.ogg Noelle: But what kind of gift...?
 It shouldn't matter, it's the thought that counts.
(−1 Heart)
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 24.ogg Noelle: Are you sure? I still feel the choice of gift matters... no matter what kind of relationship two people share.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 25.ogg Noelle: But, I don't have any experience in this area. I'm sure you're right.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 26.ogg Noelle: Then... if the gift doesn't matter, the choices are limitless... I can't decide...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 27.ogg Noelle: Do you have any ideas?
 Sending a Mondstadt Grilled Fish should be fine.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 28.ogg Noelle: Huh... Will this really get his attention?
(Proceed to Gift and Intent (It's the Heart That Matters))
 Gifts convey our intentions, we should choose carefully.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 29.ogg Noelle: That's what I think!
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 30.ogg Noelle: Everyone has their preferences, so it's important to choose the right gift if you want to get through to them.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 31.ogg Noelle: If it were me, I'd want roses.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 32.ogg Noelle: As for you, Honorary Knight... hmm...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 33.ogg Noelle: I bet you like handmade things...
 Roses and handmade things both sound nice.
 But let's think about what Quinn might like...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 34.ogg Noelle: Oh, yes! I... I just wanted to try thinking from a different perspective...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 35.ogg Noelle: Hmm... Quinn... What kind of gift would he like...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 36.ogg Noelle: If I remember correctly, isn't Quinn one of the Four Drunkards of Mondstadt...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 37.ogg Noelle: Perhaps something wine-related would do, but what...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 38.ogg Noelle: Hmm, simply thinking about it isn't really helping...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 39.ogg Noelle: Let's go to Marjorie's store and see what's available.
(Proceed to Gift and Intent (Sincerest of Gifts))

(Talking with Barbara)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: ...
 That's the last we'll see of him! Whatever he was planning, he won't try it now...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Thank you...
 You don't sound too happy about it...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: I had a look at his wounds... I think he really did need healing.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: Even if he was a Treasure Hoarder...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: Still, I'm sure you made the right decision. If he did have some ulterior motive, we might have fallen into a trap.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: Whatever the case, if he does have others lurking about, we're probably still in danger. We should go back to Mondstadt.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: *sigh* It looks like Chilibrew isn't in the cards this time. I'll have to get around to making one for you next time.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: I'm... heading back to Mondstadt. You should come as well — don't spend too long out here.

A Chance meeting[]

(Approach Lynette)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Is that... Lynette? With a little kitty?)
???: Meow~
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: ...Meow.
???: Meow~
 What are you up to?
 (Approach stealthily...)
???: Meow!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: Wha...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: ...Oh, it's you. One second — now activating chat mode...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: You made me jump there. I thought they'd finally caught me.
 Made you jump? Barely. I didn't notice.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: Well, my heart rate did. Jumped up a little, I mean.
 ...So uh, what kind of trouble are you in, exactly?
 Is someone out to kidnap you?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: ...Objectively speaking, the trouble is entirely of my own making.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: Half an hour ago, I was at Hotel Debord for a drinks reception — it was to celebrate the successful opening of a show, but it was draining my energy... So, I waited for the right moment, then snuck away so I could switch to standby mode.
 I see... So they sent someone to find you and bring you back? But why?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: Um... Probably because I'm playing the lead role in the show.
 ...
 The lead role!?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: Is that so surprising? I'm always getting invitations to do solo performances... I just usually get Lyney to write back and turn them down. But then came the Fontinalia Film Festival...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: We took all the kids from the House of the Hearth out to see a film, and after it finished, they all started clamoring for me to try out acting for some reason. Even Lyney was chanting along with them.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 11.ogg Lynette: Anyway, it just so happened that a director called Merieux had sent me an invitation right around then... I'll spare you the details, but basically, I ended up accepting it.
 So this is the dramatic debut of the magician's puppet, huh...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 12.ogg Lynette: Yup, you nailed it. I'm playing the role of a puppet.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: In fact, the show's called The Lost Puppet, and it's a masked mime show. So I don't have to do any facial expressions, or say any lines — literally just a series of physical movements. The director says it's a very "avant-garde" art form.
 That does sound pretty avant-garde... But can people understand the plot?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 14.ogg Lynette: Art is not comprehended by the mind, but felt in the heart... At least, that's what the director says. Anyway, if nothing else, the opening performance seemed to go down well.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 15.ogg Lynette: At the drinks reception, everyone was crowding around me saying... "triumphant character portrayal," "faithful adaptation of the original work," "unequivocally, quintessentially avant-garde"... and stuff like that.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 16.ogg Lynette: ...But being the center of attention is draining. So the moment they left me to go harass the director instead, I was out of there.
 (For once, you weren't able to use Lyney as a human shield...)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 17.ogg Lynette: The other thing is... Some weird things happened while I was on the stage...
???: Meow!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 18.ogg Lynette: Oh... Sorry, Bonnie, I didn't mean to leave you out of the conversation. My bad.
 I take it Bonnie's your pet cat?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 19.ogg Lynette: No, we just met. We bumped into each other right after I slipped away.
 ...And you've already named her!?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 20.ogg Lynette: Well, it'd be kind of difficult for us to communicate otherwise... Besides, I think she's taken a liking to the name. Haven't you, Bonnie?
Bonnie: Meow!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 21.ogg Lynette: Yeah, that's right, good kitty. We'll go find your owner soon, I promise.
 Owner? Not a stray cat, then?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 22.ogg Lynette: Nope — she's wearing a collar, and for the most part she's pretty well-groomed. If she is a stray, she hasn't been for long.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 23.ogg Lynette: Her stomach's been growling a lot... I guess she must've been missing for a few days now. As much as I'd love to hang out with her for a while longer, her owner's probably worried sick about her... assuming she has an owner, that is.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 24.ogg Lynette: ...Ugh, but the reception... I should probably show my face there again at some point, even if it's just to make excuses and leave again... Ugh, decision time...
Bonnie: Meow...
 Is this a tough decision for you?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 25.ogg Lynette: Well... I just find it exhausting, thinking through all the different ramifications of difference choices and so on — that's more Lyney's area than mine. So, unless it's something really important, I usually just leave the decision-making to him.
 But for once, he's not here when you need him... Bet that doesn't happen often.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 26.ogg Lynette: It's fine. He got Freminet to make me a little something for just this situation:
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 27.ogg Lynette: Poof — a "Fateometer."
 ...What's this?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 28.ogg Lynette: It looks pretty over-the-top, I know, but it's essentially just a box of cards... He kept the design simple so it'd be harder to break.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 29.ogg Lynette: The way it works is: I pick a card at random, then look at the number on the card.
 And how does that help you make a decision?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 30.ogg Lynette: Well, for example... If the number on the card is 5 or higher, I help Bonnie find her owner. If it's less than 5, I go back to the reception.
 Simple and straightforward!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 31.ogg Lynette: I just have to believe in the bond between me and my cards, and my fate will reveal itself to me in numerical form... at least that's what Lyney said. Anyway, I guess I'll give you a demonstration.
Bonnie: Meow!

A Decision[]

As Lynette attempts to draw a card, the device emits a horrendous grinding sound...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: Huh, it didn't like that... Was I using it wrong? Hmm. Maybe if I just...
Lynette smacks the card box, all the cards fall onto the ground... Then, she picks one at random.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: ...Clearly, there's some design flaws to iron out. I'll have to let Freminet know.
 I feel like maybe this wasn't a design issue...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: Let's see, which card did I get...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: ...4.
 Less than 5... So that means, no helping Bonnie...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: Well... The cards fell on the ground though, so I don't think it counts as fate.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: If you wanna get the right answer, you have to let fate decide... Also something Lyney said.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: So to put it another way, if picking a card up off the ground is how to NOT leave it to fate... then that means, it must be the wrong answer!
 (I think what Lyney really meant is, sometimes you have to accept the answer you didn't want...)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: Um... Or... Why don't you pick a card? Since I ran into you here, that means, uh... our fates are, like... interfering with each other...
 You should leave the razzle-dazzling to Lyney...
 Alright, I'll pick another card for you...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: Thank you... This one is final, I promise...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: Here, take the fateometer. If it's 5 or above, that means "fate successfully changed," anything lower than 5 is a fail.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 11.ogg Lynette: Also... If you have your own thoughts about what I should do, feel free to share it. Now that I've got a good problem-solver here to help, I don't need to run every little thing by fate...
 I think you should head back to the drinks reception... (This dialogue option leads to Mask.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 31.ogg Lynette: Huh... Back to the drinks reception...
 I mean... clearly you don't want to go... You could just—
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 35.ogg Lynette: Nope, I said it was your decision. I'm not gonna waste any more energy dragging my feet.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 36.ogg Lynette: Besides, the drinks reception is technically part of the job as an official publicity event. So if I bail on it...
 You'll feel guilty inside?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 37.ogg Lynette: ...I might get sued for breach of contract, and that would be a huge pain in the butt.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 38.ogg Lynette: One other thing... Do you wanna come with me? If you're free, I mean.
 Sure. Then you'll have at least one friend there.
 Hopefully that will make it more bearable?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 39.ogg Lynette: ...Mm-hmm. Thanks.
(Continues to Mask)
 I think you should help Bonnie... (This dialogue option leads to Detectives.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 26.ogg Lynette: ...So we're looking for Bonnie's owner?
Bonnie: Meow!
 So, how do you plan to find Bonnie's owner?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 30.ogg Lynette: Umm... I think I'll go to The Steambird and see about putting an ad in the paper. You wanna come along? ...I think Bonnie wants you to come with.
Bonnie: Meow...
 Sure, if it means I get to hang out with you for a bit longer.
Bonnie: Meow, meow~!
(Continues to Detectives)
 [Fateometer] I'm not sure... Let's leave this one to fate. (This dialogue option leads to Mask or Detectives.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 24.ogg Lynette: Alright... Then let's see where fate will lead me.
 (If the card drawn is equal or less than 5) (This dialogue option leads to Mask.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 31.ogg Lynette: Huh... Back to the drinks reception...
 I have to ask about this deck of cards...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 33.ogg Lynette: There's twenty cards in total, numbered 1 to 20. So there's only a one-in-five chance of drawing less than a 5.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 34.ogg Lynette: I should also mention — this time the cutoff was 5, but I just set that to whatever I feel like.
 I mean... clearly you don't want to go... You could just—
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 35.ogg Lynette: Nope, I said it was your decision. I'm not gonna waste any more energy dragging my feet.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 36.ogg Lynette: Besides, the drinks reception is technically part of the job as an official publicity event. So if I bail on it...
 You'll feel guilty inside?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 37.ogg Lynette: ...I might get sued for breach of contract, and that would be a huge pain in the butt.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 38.ogg Lynette: One other thing... Do you wanna come with me? If you're free, I mean.
 Sure. Then you'll have at least one friend there.
 Hopefully that will make it more bearable?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 39.ogg Lynette: ...Mm-hmm. Thanks.
(Continues to Mask)
 (If the card drawn is grater than 5) (This dialogue option leads to Detectives.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 25.ogg Lynette: ...So we're looking for Bonnie's owner?
 I have to ask about this deck of cards...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 27.ogg Lynette: There's twenty cards in total, numbered 1 to 20. So there's only a one-in-five chance of drawing less than a 5.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 28.ogg Lynette: I should also mention — this time the cutoff was 5, but I just set that to whatever I feel like.
 Wow, you REALLY don't want to go back to that reception party...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 29.ogg Lynette: To put it in perspective, I said I'd only do the show if I drew a 1... Fate can be pretty sneaky sometimes.
Bonnie: Meow!
 So, how do you plan to find Bonnie's owner?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 30.ogg Lynette: Umm... I think I'll go to The Steambird and see about putting an ad in the paper. You wanna come along? ...I think Bonnie wants you to come with.
Bonnie: Meow...
 Sure, if it means I get to hang out with you for a bit longer.
Bonnie: Meow, meow~!
(Continues to Detectives)
 How about... you do neither? (This dialogue option leads to Ending: "Standby Mode".)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 12.ogg Lynette: ...Huh?
 If it was that urgent, someone would have come looking by now.
 That applies both to your troupe, and to Bonnie's owner.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: What you're saying is... since nobody's come looking... I can just keep hanging out with Bonnie for a bit longer?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 14.ogg Lynette: ...Is that really okay...?
Bonnie: Meow!
 [Persuasion] Well, Bonnie sure seems to like that idea!
 (If the card drawn is equal or less than 10) (This dialogue option leads to the previous choice.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 15.ogg Lynette: Hmmmmm... Maybe not... As much as I don't want to, I really should be getting back...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 16.ogg Lynette: Besides, if someone does come looking for me or Bonnie, and finds me just chilling out with a cat... I feel like I'd have a lot of explaining to do.
Bonnie: Meow...
(Dialogue returns to option selection)
 (If the card drawn is grater than 10) (This dialogue option leads to Ending: "Standby Mode".)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 17.ogg Lynette: You make a good point!
 We can just stick around here for a while...
 So if anyone does come looking for you, they'll find you.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 18.ogg Lynette: Okay, well... Assuming Bonnie hasn't strayed too far from where she went missing, there's a chance we might bump into her owner in either The Steambird offices or the restaurant...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 19.ogg Lynette: ...So, stick around here in standby mode? Yeah, that suits me.
 If you're going into standby mode...
 Shall we find some cat food?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 20.ogg Lynette: Oh, good idea! Bonnie's definitely hungry.
 If we're getting cat food...
 Shall we get some snacks for us, too?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 21.ogg Lynette: May as well, we could be here a while.
 Well, since we've got cat food and snacks...
 Let's find a place to chill.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 22.ogg Lynette: ...When I was trying to find somewhere I could space out earlier... Uh, I mean, collect my thoughts — I figured the cafe might be a good shot.
Bonnie: Meow!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 23.ogg Lynette: Alright then. Plan of action: Spend the whole day spacing out— I mean, in standby mode.

Under the Same Shade[]

(If the player uses an attack near the cats and dogs)

Hangout Event EndedYour attacks have caused the stray cats and dogs to flee. They probably won't be back for some time...

Media:vo tmcop001 1911601 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: This is a pretty good spot, right?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911601 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: There are tons of stray cats and dogs here at the outskirts. Every time I come to Komore Teahouse, I bring some food for them.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911601 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: It just sort of became a tradition over time... at first it was a bit of a chore, but the more time I spent with them, the more I came to enjoy it.
 They seem to like you a lot.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911601 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: You think so? Well, feed them enough times, and I'm sure you'll win their affection, too.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911601 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Not only that, you'll also start to feel that they're your responsibility. Whenever you have any free time, you'll find yourself desperate to come and visit them.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911601 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Why don't you try feeding them, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911601 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: I brought some of their favorite food just so you can get into their good graces.
 Okay, I guess I'll try.
 Is it definitely safe?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911601 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Don't worry, I've trained them to not be aggressive toward humans.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911601 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: They'll still run away if they find someone threatening, but I'm pretty sure they'll like you.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911601 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: You're an approachable person, and they can tell. Animals are very sensitive to these things.
(Obtain Fresh Meat ×1 and Fresh Fish ×1)

(Talk to Thoma again)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911601 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Just place some food here, and they'll come running.

Hungry?[]

(Talk to Thoma)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: That didn't take long. Look at that, best buds already!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Some of the dogs are even showing their bellies — that's a sign they really trust you.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Well, you'll rarely see Taroumaru roll onto his back, though. He's a ninja dog, so he's always on guard in case an enemy approaches...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Speaking of ninja dogs, I actually saw one the other day on the beach north of Konda Village.
 Why would there be ninja dogs in the wild?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: That's the thing. They rarely go off on their own. Usually, they stick with their human ninja partners.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: After retiring, most ninja dogs are taken in by their partner. Or sometimes, someone else in the Yashiro Commission will take them in.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: It's extremely rare to find them on their own in the wild. So it makes me a little concerned.
 Why don't you adopt it?
 We could adopt it together?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Haha, believe me, I wanted to bring it back to the Yashiro Commission. But it wouldn't let me.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: I tried establishing some trust by petting it on the head, but it gave me a nasty bite.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: Still, I don't wanna give up on it... Nobody really goes out that way, and I don't know what it would have to eat out there.
 Why don't we go and see it together?
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 Perhaps you should give it some time to calm down.
(Procees to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 Why don't we go and see it together?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 18.ogg Thoma: That would be great. Even though it's not the most approachable dog, I still want to give it another try.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 19.ogg Thoma: It seems to sit in the same spot on the beach all day, only moving to take a few paces back when the tide comes in. Last time I saw it, its fur was soaking wet.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 20.ogg Thoma: Ultimately, bringing it back to the Yashiro Commission is going to be a lot better for it than leaving it sitting out in the elements all day.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 21.ogg Thoma: Or... we could even bring it back to Komore Teahouse, to make friends with Taroumaru...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 22.ogg Thoma: Well, let's see if we even get that far.
(Proceed to Ninken by the Shore)

Branch 2[]

 Perhaps you should give it some time to calm down.:
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: That's a good idea.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: It was in a very aggressive mood the last time I saw it. I'm worried it might bite you if we tried to approach it, though.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: Let's wait until it's in need before going to its aid — that's probably safer.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: But back to our other animal friends. Now that the weather's getting colder, I'm wondering whether I should knit some sweaters for these strays.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: Problem is, most of them don't actually like being touched, so I can't take their measurements very easily.
 We could photograph them?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: That's not a bad idea! We could take photos of them from different angles, then work out their measurements by using other objects in the picture as a reference...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 17.ogg Thoma: See, you're the real fixer here. Let's give it a try!

 Quest DescriptionYou make the acquaintance of a rather passionate adventurer at the front desk of the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild...

(Approach Bennett)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Ah, it's you! Didn't think I'd be running into you here... Hehe, I guess it's my lucky day...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: How're your adventures going lately? Did you come here to get a new commission from Katheryne, or to get paid?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: And where're you going after this? Bet you've got a really exciting adventure lined up, huh?
 You are...?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: The name's Bennett. I'm your run-of-the-mill adventurer from Mondstadt!
 Nice to meet you, Bennett!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: Ah... I'm talking too much, aren't I... I'm sorry...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: I was just so excited to run into someone I admire so much... And, uh... maybe a little starstruck, too... haha...
 You... admire me?
 You're that excited to see me...?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: Of course! You're the mysterious Traveler, the hero who quelled the Stormterror crisis, and the leader of your own adventure team to boot!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: If I'm being honest... I'm totally jealous of all your achievements...
 (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)'s Adventure Team...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: Yeah, word's been spreading in adventurer circles for a long time now. Your adventure team shows up all over the continent...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: It might look like you're just handling a bunch of boring commissions, but then, as soon as something big goes down, you're always there!
 That's just coincidence....
 I have my reasons...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 11.ogg Bennett: Anyway, I just really envy you. You're sort of like... the protagonist of this world, or something. Hahaha...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 12.ogg Bennett: Me, on the other hand, I'm just some unlucky guy. My adventure team even...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 13.ogg Bennett: Ah— never mind, I shouldn't get all down in the dumps in front of someone I admire. I should be open to see what I can learn!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 14.ogg Bennett: Speaking of which... I have a favor to ask...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 15.ogg Bennett: Um... When you go adventuring later, can I come and watch?
 ...You just want to stand there and watch?
 Aren't you going to give me a hand!?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 16.ogg Bennett: Eh-hehe... Maybe you don't know. I'm a really unlucky person to have around...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 17.ogg Bennett: If you brought me along on an adventure, my bad luck would probably just screw everything up!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 18.ogg Bennett: I don't want to get you into any trouble, so just let me watch from the sidelines... that'd be good enough for me...
 We could just do something else instead. (This dialogue option leads to Something... Other Than Adventure? or What Is This, a Day Trip?.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 19.ogg Bennett: Hmm? Something else?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 20.ogg Bennett: ...I guess you're right. Even just the chance to talk with you would be great, too. Yeah... let's forget about adventuring for now, hah...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 21.ogg Bennett: But, uh... what would we do instead?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 22.ogg Bennett: Apart from going on adventures... the only thing I do is take care of my dads in the Adventurers' Guild...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 23.ogg Bennett: So... I really can't think of anything else to do besides adventuring.
 Let me think about it.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 24.ogg Bennett: Alright! I feel like whatever we do, as long as you're involved, it'll be totally worth it!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 25.ogg Bennett: Uh... but don't forget, I'll be bringing my bad luck with me...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 26.ogg Bennett: So it probably won't be a very fun trip... haha...
 It won't bother me.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 27.ogg Bennett: That's good, that's good... I was afraid you'd back out.
 As long as you don't cause too much trouble. (−1 Heart)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 30.ogg Bennett: Oh, I, uh... I'll try, although most of the time it's completely out of my control...
 I'm looking forward to it.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 28.ogg Bennett: Really? Looking forward to hanging out with someone like me...?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 29.ogg Bennett: Seems like the rumors are all true! You really are a nice person able to bring people together, hehe.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 31.ogg Bennett: So, where are we gonna go?
 How about we hang out around town? (This dialogue option leads to Something... Other Than Adventure?.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 32.ogg Bennett: Cool, that would be nice! I was planning to stock up on some adventuring supplies anyway...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 33.ogg Bennett: Oh! Sorry, I'm back talking about adventuring again. You must think I'm so boring...
 It's okay, I like adventures too.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 34.ogg Bennett: Really!? Well, of course you do. You are a famous adventurer, after all.
 Let's change the topic. (−1 Heart)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 35.ogg Bennett: Oh, um... a—alright, haha...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 36.ogg Bennett: How about we go to the souvenir store?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 37.ogg Bennett: "With Wind Comes Glory" is my favorite shop ever. What can I say, Mondstadt's where I grew up.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 38.ogg Bennett: Let's go!
(Proceed to Something... Other Than Adventure?)
 How about a walk in the wild? (This dialogue option leads to What Is This, a Day Trip?.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 39.ogg Bennett: That's a good idea!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 40.ogg Bennett: For someone like me, I'm actually way more familiar with the wilderness than the city, especially around Mondstadt!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 41.ogg Bennett: I mean, I'm not on the same level as Fischl, who is also in the Adventurers' Guild. But that's expected, because she works in the Intelligence Department.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 42.ogg Bennett: Oh, I know this gorgeous place. It's sort of a dandelion-covered meadow.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 43.ogg Bennett: It's got a great Mondstadt feel. Do you want to check it out?
 Can't wait!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 44.ogg Bennett: Awesome! I was worried that it wouldn't be your thing...
 I can accompany you for a quick look. (−1 Heart)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 45.ogg Bennett: Uh... okay, I'll try not to let you down, haha...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 46.ogg Bennett: Shall we?
(Proceed to What Is This, a Day Trip?)
 Sure! Let's go on an adventure! (This dialogue option leads to Can't Make an Omelette Without Eggs or Expansive Eya.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 47.ogg Bennett: Really? I didn't mishear you, did I?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 48.ogg Bennett: You mean... go adventure with you, just like we'd do if I was on your adventure team?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 49.ogg Bennett: Wow! I never thought I'd get an opportunity like this!
 Come on, I'm not as great as you make out...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 50.ogg Bennett: Don't be so modest! I've heard about all the great things you've done, not to mention the high praise you get from the Adventurers' Guild...
 I've always wanted to go adventuring with you, too.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 51.ogg Bennett: Aw, shucks... hearing you say that has got me all flustered, hehe... but I'm happy to hear it!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 52.ogg Bennett: ...By the way, since we've got this rare chance to work together, let me share some recent intel with you!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 53.ogg Bennett: According to my friend Fischl in the guild, a mysterious and dangerous ruin has recently been discovered...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 54.ogg Bennett: Based on how the Guild ranks the difficulty of its commissions, it's probably ranked between a Rank B and a Rank A.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 55.ogg Bennett: Normally, I wouldn't feel confident about taking on this level of commission...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 56.ogg Bennett: After all, with my poor luck, it's safer for me to take on commissions that are a few notches lower than my actual ability, haha.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 57.ogg Bennett: But since you'll be joining me this time, it'll be a peace of cake, right?
 Does defeating Stormterror count as an S-rank commission?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 58.ogg Bennett: Of course! Defeating Stormterror puts you on par with Guild Master Cyrus in my mind.
 Would stealing the Holy Lyre Del Himmel count as an S-rank commission?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 59.ogg Bennett: There's no way the Guild would issue an illegal commission like that!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 60.ogg Bennett: Heh... By the way, this ruin might be a dangerous one, but that usually means there'll be some great treasure hidden inside. I can't wait!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 61.ogg Bennett: Oh, uh... do you usually make some food before you set out on an adventure?
 I do. (This dialogue option leads to Can't Make an Omelette Without Eggs.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 62.ogg Bennett: Hmm... the cautious choice. No wonder you're so good at this.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 63.ogg Bennett: Seems I really can learn a few things from you, hehe.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 64.ogg Bennett: In that case, as per your tradition, let's get cooking!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 65.ogg Bennett: Oh yeah — I actually invented a pretty nice dish recently!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 66.ogg Bennett: I can't say it's super tasty, but I think it'd be perfect for an adventure. So, how about I show you how to make it?
 Okay, how about I fetch the ingredients and you cook?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 67.ogg Bennett: Cool! I really miss that old feeling of working with a partner.
 Nice, and thank you!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 68.ogg Bennett: Oh wait till you see— Oh, uh... huh. Ingredients... seem to be in short supply, hehe...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 69.ogg Bennett: I'm really sorry... I probably need your help to get some.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 70.ogg Bennett: The ingredients needed for this dish are... Mint, Radish, and Slime Condensate. One of each, please.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 71.ogg Bennett: You got that, right? I'll wait for you near the pot at Good Hunter. Come find me when you're done collecting!
(Proceed to Can't Make an Omelette Without Eggs)
 No, I usually leave straight away. (This dialogue option leads to Expansive Eya.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 72.ogg Bennett: Oh! I guess you're such a pro that you don't need to worry about that, huh? Awesome...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 73.ogg Bennett: Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!
(Proceed to Expansive Eya)

Can't Make an Omelette Without Eggs[]

(Talk to Bennett)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: You get them all? That's fantastic! You've really outdone yourself.
(Give the ingredients)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Now that we've got our ingredients, allow me to handle the cooking!
Bennett cooks skillfully, but something doesn't feel right...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: It's done!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: I forgot the exact order you're supposed to add the ingredients in, but... it should be alright.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: I'll pack it up and leave it with you until we get to the ruins.
 Are you sure it's okay to eat?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: I think so...? Should be... pretty much... basically the same as when I first came up with it. So... yup!
 I feel like this dish... reeks of misfortune.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: Huh? It's just an ordinary dish... hearing you say that is really kind of disappointing...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: Well, now that the food is ready, let's head for those mysterious ruins!
(Obtain  Ominous Dish)
(Proceed to Treacherous Thermadon)

The Shadow Over Dadaupa[]

Media:vo dancop001 1910401 diona 01.ogg Diona: Hey, there's loads of monsters ahead, be careful! You don't want to shake up the entire gorge, do you?
Media:vo dancop001 1910401 diona 02.ogg Diona: D—Don't think that I'm worried about you. Because I'm not! If you get noticed, then I'll definitely be in trouble too. So... so just be careful, okay?
(Being noticed)
Media:vo dancop001 1910402 diona 01.ogg Diona: We've been spotted!
(Being noticed three times)
Media:vo dancop001 1910401 diona 03.ogg Diona: Wha... Well that definitely caught their attention. You caused quite a commotion...
Media:vo dancop001 1910401 diona 04.ogg Diona: Looks like we won't be able to do this together... I'll think of another way.
Hangout Event Ended: The monsters of Dadaupa Gorge have all been alerted, and thus does Diona's plan fail as well...
(Getting to the first spot)
Media:vo dancop001 1910402 diona 02.ogg Diona: Psst, hey! Move more to the side and stay hidden, otherwise they'll spot you!
(Finding Diona at the first spot)
Media:vo dancop001 1910402 diona 03.ogg Diona: Huh? How did you find me? I haven't been keeping an eye on you! I just happen to be hiding here.
(Getting to the second spot)
Media:vo dancop001 1910402 diona 04.ogg Diona: Just hide in the bushes if there's no other way.
(Finding Diona at the second spot)
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 01.ogg Diona: Keep your head down silly, and don't get spotted! Hurry, this way!
(Getting to the third spot)
Media:vo dancop001 1910402 diona 05.ogg Diona: Careful, don't get too close to the monsters, keep to the side of the road...
(Finding Diona at the third spot)
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 diona 01.ogg Diona: Whaa... how did you find me? Guess you've got a couple tricks up your sleeve, too. Let's keep going.
(Finding Diona at the fourth spot)
Media:vo dancop001 1910402 diona 06.ogg Diona: Not bad... you were able to keep up.
Media:vo dancop001 1910402 diona 07.ogg Diona: That stupid old man should be here somewhere. Let's search around.

Dead-Drunk Draff[]

Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 01.ogg Draff: What was that? Some kind of... soup? *hic* Or herbs?
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 02.ogg Diona: Ugh, just as I suspected... he's completely drunk!
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 02.ogg Draff: Oh! Is that you, Diona? My beloved daughter... Hmm? What're you... doing here anyway?
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 03.ogg Draff: Oh! Right! You must be here for th—that soup... or herbs... or what was it again?
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 04.ogg Draff: Well I found it! ...Just for you! It's all here in my flask, hahaha... Look, it's full of soup, or... whatever this stuff is!
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 03.ogg Diona: Ugh, c'mon Daddy, pull yourself together... How much did you have to drink?
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 05.ogg Draff N—Not much, really... just the usual amount haha...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 06.ogg Draff: Here! Take my flask with the herbal soup stuff that you were looking for. I'm going to continue the hunt... *hic*
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 07.ogg Draff: You know, I saw this huge... I mean HUGE hilihog next to the tribe's camp.
 What's a hilihog?
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 08.ogg Draff: Ha! You don't know a hilihog? It's like a forest boar... I saw it next to the hilichurl *hic* tribe's camp! It's called a hi-li-hog! Boy, you sure don't know anything about hunting... haha...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 09.ogg Draff: And not only were there hilihogs, there were hiliHOUNDS, too! Ugh, don't you know anything? *hic* Well... if we can hunt a hilihog, it'd mean a lot of food for a long time.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 04.ogg Diona: Ugh... looks like he's enjoyed himself today.
 I was looking forward to seeing some hilihogs and hilihounds...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 05.ogg Diona: Hey, keep it together! You're not the one that's drunk!
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 06.ogg Diona: Silly old man... I doubt he can even walk straight in this state.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 07.ogg Diona: If we're gonna get him out of here, we need to sober him up. Good thing I know just what to make for him.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 08.ogg Diona: But given how much he usually drinks, I'll need ingredients that'll pack a real punch.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 09.ogg Diona: Perhaps the herbal soup made by the samachurls will come in handy...
 Draff said he had just found some, let's ask him.
(Go to Branch 1)
 I can deal with a few monsters. I'll bring some of that herbal soup back.
(Go to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 10.ogg Diona: Pff! I wouldn't trust a single word this old drunk says. But go ahead and talk to him if you believe him. Tch, there's probably nothing but some leftover booze in his flask anyway.
 Draff, may I take a look at your flask? Diona needs to use some of that herbal soup.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 10.ogg Draff: Hm? Oh! Sure... here, take it. Just don't spill it. It took a lot of... *hic* ...a lot of work to get that stuff.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 11.ogg Diona: *sigh* You actually asked him for the soup? C'mon don't waste any more time, there's only...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 12.ogg Diona: Ugh! What's that smell!? *cough* *cough* Get that stuff away from me! Yuck, that's awful!
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 13.ogg Diona: ...Wait... *cough* ...could this really be that herbal soup?
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 11.ogg Draff: How 'bout that! Daddy remembered what you *hic* told me... Ah... give your old man some credit, I made a promise and I kept it... I, haha... wouldn't ever let my baby down. Ha...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 14.ogg Diona: ...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 15.ogg Diona: My genius father... What are you gonna use to hold your booze in now that you've filled your flask with this stuff, hmmm?"
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 12.ogg Draff: I'll just drink straight from the bottle! Hehehe, it's not a problem... *hic* ...not a problem at all...
 Well, looks like we have everything we need.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 16.ogg Diona: Right, I'll whip up a concoction to sober him up. It won't take long.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 17.ogg Diona: This soup was meant to give hilichurls energy. Combined with some ingredients I have, this should snap him right out of it.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 18.ogg Diona: Hehe, good thing I brought my shaker with me. Uh... it'd be a waste to use up all the ingredients at once.
 Can you really use this to sober him up?
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 19.ogg Diona: I have my ways... just sit back and watch.
Diona begins making a concoction to sober up Draff...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 20.ogg Diona: Alright, it's finished! Here Daddy, drink this.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 13.ogg Draff: No! I—I can't drink anymore! If I drink more, my daughter will be very angry with me...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 14.ogg Draff: No more, can't drink... anymore! Drinking — is — bad.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 21.ogg Diona: Huh!? Why would he remember stuff like that now!?
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 22.ogg Diona: C'mon! Just! Drink it!
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 15.ogg Draff: *sip* Ooh! Hehe, hey! This tastes pretty good... Fine, I'll drink... a little bit... JUST a little bit though...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 23.ogg Diona: Yeah, that's right, just a little bit. Now, down the hatch!
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 16.ogg Draff: *glug* *glug* *glug*
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 17.ogg Draff: ...Ahh... Wow... wow that was incredible...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 18.ogg Draff: Huh? Wh—What are you doing here, Diona? Argh... and... why does my head hurt so bad?
 (Could those ingredients really make something that good?)
 (What's going on...?)
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 24.ogg Diona: *sigh* That seemed to do the trick. If you're sober now, then let's hurry and get out of here.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 19.ogg Draff: Huh? Oh, right... I remember now. I came here looking for something. I think it was some kind of... herbal soup or something?
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 20.ogg Draff: Yeah, that's it! Herbal soup! The one you told me about last time, Diona. Samachurls make that stuff a—and I found it!
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 21.ogg Draff: I filled my whole flask with it, too! It'll definitely be enough for you. It's right here... wait. Where's my flask? Oh no... I didn't lose it, did I?
 Diona has it.
 Diona already used the soup to sober you up.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 22.ogg Draff: Really? Did I... drink too much again? Oh...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 25.ogg Diona: Never mind, Daddy. I'm already used to it. Now that you're sober, let's start heading back. Allan and the others are waiting at the entrance.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 23.ogg Draff: Ah! That's right... *sigh* I completely forgot about Allan...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 26.ogg Diona: How do you feel, Daddy? If you still can't walk, the Traveler can help you.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 24.ogg Draff: No no, I'm fine. Let's get going.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 25.ogg Draff: *sigh* I... must have gotten carried away with my drinking again... Diona, I'm... *sigh*
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 27.ogg Diona: Daddy... I've seen it all before. Besides, you've done way weirder things when you've been drinking.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 28.ogg Diona: Like the time you chased dogs around town calling them hilihounds, or that other time you filled empty bottles with the town's spring water and kept chugging them...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 29.ogg Diona: Oh, and don't forget that time you begged Myweiss to write you a song about a hunter and his... loyal hilihound.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 26.ogg Draff: Alright, alright! That's enough. The Traveler can hear you, you know...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 30.ogg Diona: Huh. What you did this time was actually pretty normal compared to what you've done in the past.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 27.ogg Draff: *sigh* Good thing I found that herbal soup, otherwise we really would have been up a creek without a paddle...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 31.ogg Diona: ...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 32.ogg Diona: Thanks, Daddy.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 28.ogg Draff: Huh? What'd you say? I couldn't hear you very well...
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 33.ogg Diona: Ummm, I said don't drink so much!
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 29.ogg Draff: Okay, okay... I know. I'll try to drink less from now on.
Media:vo dancop001 1910403 diona 34.ogg Diona: *sigh* ...Silly old man.
(Talk to Allan)
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 allan 01.ogg Allan: It's Diona and the Honorary Knight. You've brought Draff back!
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 allan 02.ogg Allan: Thank goodness you're alright. I was about to report to the Knights of Favonius if you took any longer.
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 allan 03.ogg Allan: Are you okay, Draff?
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 draff 01.ogg Draff: I'm fine, thanks to Diona and the Traveler. Otherwise, things might have ended very differently.
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 draff 02.ogg Draff: Allan, go round up the others. Let's tally up our game and head back to Springvale.
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 allan 04.ogg Allan: Understood, I'll get right on it.
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 draff 03.ogg Draff: Diona, Traveler... will you be coming back to Springvale with us?
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 diona 02a.ogg Diona: No, we only came here for the herbal soup.
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 diona 03.ogg Diona: And since you've already found it for us, we'll return to Mondstadt.
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 draff 04.ogg Draff: Alright. Oh, but do you still have enough left over after making the stuff to sober me up?
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 diona 04.ogg Diona: ...Of course we do. I'm a professional bartender, there's no way I'd use up all my ingredients at once, tch. The remainder will be enough for what I need.
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 diona 05.ogg Diona: We'll be on our way back to Mondstadt then. Just hurry up and get yourself back to Springvale, Daddy.
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 diona 06.ogg Diona: Oh, and don't drink so much!
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 draff 05.ogg Draff: I know I know, don't worry. I mean, I don't even have my flask anymore...
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 diona 07.ogg Diona: Yeah right! Who knows how many more of those you have.
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 diona 08.ogg Diona: Traveler, we've gathered all the ingredients we need. Now, let's head back to the Cat's Tail.
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 diona 09.ogg Diona: When we arrive, I'll make you a supreme specialty drink that will shatter every fantasy you've ever had about booze.
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 draff 06.ogg Draff: *sigh* Drinking sure causes a lot of trouble, I really need to control myself from now on.
Media:vo dancop001 1910404 allan 05.ogg Allan: Draff, everyone's ready. We can head out once we've tallied up the hunt.

Diona's Special[]

(Talk to Diona at the Cat's Tail)
Media:vo dancop001 1910405 diona 01.ogg Diona: Alright, let's go inside. I'll clean my shaker and pour out the herbal soup from the old man's flask...
Media:vo dancop001 1910405 diona 02.ogg Diona: What's wrong? Didn't you want a cocktail? Why are you just staring like that?
 How are you able to make anything from an ingredient that smells like that?
Media:vo dancop001 1910405 diona 03.ogg Diona: Ah, so that's what you're wondering. I can't help it. Basically, any drink that's made by my hands can only be a good drink.
Media:vo dancop001 1910405 diona 04.ogg Diona: This isn't bartender's pride talking, this is a fact.
Media:vo dancop001 1910405 diona 05.ogg Diona: Regardless of the type of ingredients or method, as long as I make the drink myself, it's bound to be delicious.
Media:vo dancop001 1910405 diona 06.ogg Diona: However, that's just the way it is for now. I've been searching for a solution, and the herbal soup is one of the ingredients that I've been searching for.
Media:vo dancop001 1910405 diona 07.ogg Diona: Once I find the solution, I'll show those old boozehounds how terrible alcohol really is, haha!
Media:vo dancop001 1910405 diona 08.ogg Diona: Anyway, aren't you here for a drink yourself? Come on in, I have plenty of ingredients to whip you up something special inside.
Media:vo dancop001 1910405 diona 09.ogg Diona: And after I make you my specialty drink, haha! I promise you'll never want to set foot in another tavern ever again.
 That bad, huh... Didn't you just say that you can only make delicious drinks?
Media:vo dancop001 1910405 diona 10.ogg Diona: Uh, well... Yeah. But I also said that's only for now. There are plenty of methods and ingredients I haven't tried yet.
Media:vo dancop001 1910405 diona 11.ogg Diona: Just hurry up and come in... And prepare for a specialty drink that I'm making just for you! Meow!

If it's mixed by Diona... surely it can't be that bad?

Branch 2[]

Media:vo dancop001 1910403 draff 30.ogg Draff: Herbal soup? I've got some right here... *hic* I'm sure of it!
Media:vo dancop001 1910411 diona 01.ogg Diona: He's not sobering up any time soon. I'll stay here and keep an eye on the drunk old fart. Good luck!
Media:vo dancop001 1910411 draff 01.ogg Draff: Take it... the herbal soup is in my flask. I still have that hilihog to catch! Or wait, was it a hilihound...? *hic* Well, it don't matter...

Samachurl Herbal Soup[]

(Observe pot)
Observe Pot: (This pot seems to be empty)
 (There's nothing inside...)
 (Let's keep looking elsewhere...)
(Observe pot)
Observe Pot: (Some funky liquids are twirling inside this pot. Just a whiff of the smell is enough to make you dizzy.)
 (This is probably the herbal soup that Diona is looking for...)
 (But the smell... can she really make a drink out of this?)

The Helper[]

(Talk to Katheryne)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915801 katheryne 01.ogg Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild. How can I help you today?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915801 layla 01.ogg Layla: I'd like to... Uh, I have a commission... Hmm, it's kinda strange. How should I put this...
 We would like to borrow a high-precision celestial globe.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915801 layla 02.ogg Layla: R—Right! Equipment at the Akademiya is in very high demand, and we aren't able to borrow one now. We were hoping someone else might have something similar that we could use...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915801 katheryne 02.ogg Katheryne: I don't know anything about astrology, so I'm afraid I'm unfamiliar with the device you are looking for.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915801 katheryne 03.ogg Katheryne: However, one of our requesters happens to be an astrology enthusiast. I hear that he's a collector of all sorts of specialized astrology equipment.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915801 katheryne 04.ogg Katheryne: After the Adventurers' Guild helped him out, he indicated that he'd be happy to return the favor if the adventurers ever need it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915801 katheryne 05.ogg Katheryne: Perhaps we could arrange a meeting between you two, that should help solve your problem.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915801 layla 03.ogg Layla: R—Really!?
 Thank you so much.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915801 katheryne 06.ogg Katheryne: You're welcome. It's my job to provide adventurers with the necessary support.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915801 katheryne 07.ogg Katheryne: The man's name is Azzam. Here is his address. You can go ahead and pay him a visit.

Remedial Measures[]

(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Azzam, optional)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 28.ogg Azzam: (I wonder if I'll be able to go out and look at the stars tonight...)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 01.ogg Layla: H—Hello, are you Azzam?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 01.ogg Azzam: Yes, I am. How may I help you?
You explain to Azzam the purpose of your visit.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 02.ogg Azzam: Ah, I see. Well, if it's a request from an adventurer, then I'll be happy to help you. I just so happen to have the device that you're looking for. Let me fetch it and show you, just to be sure.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 02.ogg Layla: Yes, this is it! Thank you so much!
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 03.ogg Layla: Ah sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you... I just got a little excited. Uh, please, go ahead.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 03.ogg Azzam: To be honest, judging by what stands before me, I find it very hard to believe that you're an astute Rtawahist student.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 04.ogg Layla: Uh, w—well...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 04.ogg Azzam: Astrology is a hobby of mine and these devices have cost me both time and Mora to collect. I cherish them as if they were members of my own family.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 05.ogg Azzam: Which is why I don't let just anyone borrow them on a whim. These devices are delicate and can easily be damaged if used inappropriately.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 05.ogg Layla: Oh, th—that's completely understandable. What can I do to better gain your trust?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 06.ogg Azzam: How about this — I don't need a deposit or anything, but I'd like you to share the contents of your research with me. I'll ask you some questions.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 07.ogg Azzam: If your explanation proves satisfactory, then I'll lend you the device.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 06.ogg Layla: Sh—Share the contents of my research... and answer questions? Uh oh...
 This should be a piece of cake for you. (This dialogue option leads to Thesis Defense Practice.)
(Stress Value +1)
 Don't be nervous. Just explain what you've learned. (This dialogue option leads to Thesis Defense Practice.)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 07.ogg Layla: Alright, I'll try. But I can't disclose the actual details to you... How about a general overview of the research, would that suffice?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 08.ogg Azzam: Yes, that would be fine.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 08.ogg Layla: You're probably aware that astrologists rely on the movements of celestial bodies to calculate the past and the future, as well as attempt to summarize the correlating principles, correct?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 09.ogg Azzam: Mhm, of course. This is the basic principle of astrology.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 09.ogg Layla: Ahem... My current research is about a certain phenomenon called "Astral Shift."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 10.ogg Azzam: Interesting. That's not a topic any ordinary person would be familiar with. I have a basic understanding of the concept, but I'd like to hear you explain it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 10.ogg Layla: O—Okay. Well, in short, it means that the results derived from astrology are prone to change...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 11.ogg Layla: As time continues to flow, the stars change and everything else becomes affected by this change. However, what's actually driving the change is what's worth investigating.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 11.ogg Azzam: I think that it might just be another law of nature.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 12.ogg Layla: If the changes follow a certain pattern or routine, then it could be explained as some law. But, the changes are manifold, even when considering just a single star.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 13.ogg Layla: The changes could be resulting from a simple single-orbit shift, or it could be a more complex double-orbit or even a triple or quadruple-orbit shift. These phenomena have a dramatic effect on astrological conclusions.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 14.ogg Layla: What I'm working on now is the research and prediction of the triple-orbit shift phenomenon.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 12.ogg Azzam: Triple-orbit? By yourself?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 15.ogg Layla: Uh, yes. That's right...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 13.ogg Azzam: You do know that adding an extra star to the equation increases the computational workload by more than tenfold, right...?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 16.ogg Layla: It does get a little complicated... But it's still manageable with the use of a few self-invented techniques and a large number of starlogs and star charts...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 17.ogg Layla: Which leads us to why I'm in need of a high-precision celestial globe.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 14.ogg Azzam: Hmm...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 15.ogg Azzam: Amazing. I suppose I should never have judged a book by its cover. I thought you were just trying to halfheartedly deal with some school assignment.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 18.ogg Layla: Do I really look like that sort of person...?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 16.ogg Azzam: Haha, don't worry, I'm just joking. I was a little cautious at first, but now I trust you completely.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 17.ogg Azzam: It would make me extremely happy if my collection could assist a researcher in achieving tangible results.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 18.ogg Azzam: Just make sure you return it to me once you're done.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 19.ogg Layla: Oh, thank you so much. I really needed this.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 20.ogg Layla: Whew, good thing Azzam was willing to hear me out...
 I didn't really understand what you were talking about, but I thought you did great.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 21.ogg Layla: Really? I was just explaining what it is I'm trying to do.
 You're starting to show signs of becoming a great researcher.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 22.ogg Layla: Really? Hehe, I don't know if you really mean it, but I'm happy to hear that.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 23.ogg Layla: I guess even the hardest problems can be solved as long as I'm willing to try...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 24.ogg Layla: Recording and comparing data will be much easier now that we have this device. I can do it all on my own, too.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 25.ogg Layla: Let's continue with the plan. Can you help me with a rehearsal of my thesis defense? We can do that at the House of Daena.
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Azzam, optional)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 29.ogg Azzam: (There's nothing to worry about... right?)
(Talk to Azzam again)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 27.ogg Azzam: You're quite welcome. It makes me happy to see my equipment being used to its potential.
(Proceed to Thesis Defense Practice)
 If you mess this up, you won't be able to gain his trust. (This dialogue option leads to The Remaining Problem.)
(Stress Value +1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 26.ogg Layla: Uh... Y—You're starting to make me feel nervous...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 27.ogg Layla: I'm sorry... I feel a little dizzy. Ugh... I...
 Are you okay!?
(Stress Value +1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 28.ogg Layla: Ugh... Hm?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 29.ogg Layla: I'm okay, my mind just decided to stray elsewhere for a moment. Give me a second to gather myself... Oh, is this the celestial globe that I needed to borrow?
 (Why is she asking?)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 19.ogg Azzam: Correct. I was about to test you with a few questions, but you suddenly started looking very uncomfortable.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 30.ogg Layla: Oh, don't worry about it. I don't sleep very well, so I tend to get a little dizzy from time to time. I'm fine now.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 20.ogg Azzam: (Hmm? She seems a little different all of a sudden...)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 21.ogg Azzam: Oh, *ahem* I see. Well then, can you briefly summarize your area of research for me?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 31.ogg Layla: With pleasure. I'll give you a general overview. *ahem* You're probably aware that astrologists rely on the movements of the celestial bodies to calculate the past and the future.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 32.ogg Layla: Due to the difficulty of designing an experiment and the challenges of validating theories about the past, astrological research is usually based on an immense foundation of experience.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 33.ogg Layla: And therein lies the largest complexity. Derived and validated conclusions may vary due to subtle changes caused by the flow of time and shifts in the stars.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 22.ogg Azzam: I've heard about this before. I believe it's known as Astral Shift.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 34.ogg Layla: One of the most classic challenges is to use three stars with shifting orbits to predict the overall changes that may have occurred.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 23.ogg Azzam: Ah, are you referring to the triple-orbit problem? Yes, that really is a classic problem, and a very difficult one to tackle...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 35.ogg Layla: I came up with a set of prediction methods that encompass more than half of the triple-orbit problems. However, there are quite a few limitations and requirements.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 36.ogg Layla: This set of methods is already being put into practice at the Rtawahist Darshan by my adviser, drastically simplifying the difficulty of calculations involved in the triple-orbit problem.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 24.ogg Azzam: Yes, I've heard about that! The announcement made big waves in the astrology enthusiast community. So, you were the one who came up with that...?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 37.ogg Layla: Hehe, you mustn't judge a book by its cover, you know.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 38.ogg Layla: The thesis I'm working on this time aims to address the remaining triple-orbit problems, as well as eliminate a portion of the methodology's limitations, which will make it easier to use.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 25.ogg Azzam: I see... In that case, perhaps there is no one more fitting to operate this device than you.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 26.ogg Azzam: I just keep it as part of a collection. I can't use it to its full potential like you can.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 39.ogg Layla: Thank you for understanding. I'll return it in perfect working order once I'm finished with it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 40.ogg Layla: Okay, we should be going now.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 41.ogg Layla: What did we plan to do after this...? I kinda forgot.
 You aren't Layla, are you?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 42.ogg Layla: Huh? What makes you say that? Is there something off about me?
 Your personality changed.
 The real Layla wouldn't forget what to do next.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 43.ogg Layla: *sigh* Fine, looks like I can't keep the act up any longer. I even tried to look a little panicky to emulate her behavior.
 You're the "blessing from the stars," aren't you?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 44.ogg Layla: Hehe, I suppose that is what she's been calling me.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 45.ogg Layla: With her long-term sleep deprivation, whenever her anxiety peaks, she loses consciousness and I take over.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 46.ogg Layla: However, her unpredictable and variable sleep patterns are completely out of my control, so I have to make every second count.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 47.ogg Layla: There's no one willing to help her here, so I have to step in.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 48.ogg Layla: I am rather curious about you, though. Why are you trying to help her?
 Well, she's finally decided to face the problems with her thesis head-on, and she's working very hard on it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 49.ogg Layla: Really? That's great. You're helping with all the things that I used to do for her.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 50.ogg Layla: Seems like you've given her a boost of confidence with your encouragement.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 51.ogg Layla: She's only steps away from the finish line... She's already made a lot of progress, so there's no need to push too hard now.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 52.ogg Layla: Anyway, what's the plan from here?
 She said that she wanted to practice for her thesis defense...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 53.ogg Layla: I see. Well, it wouldn't be of any help if I practiced for her, but I'll leave some notes that should come in handy.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 layla 54.ogg Layla: Come on, let's go back to the House of Daena to make preparations. You'll have to tell her later when she wakes up.
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Azzam, optional)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 30.ogg Azzam: (There's probably nothing to worry about.)
(Talk to Azzam again)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915802 azzam 27.ogg Azzam: You're quite welcome. It makes me happy to see my equipment being used to its potential.
(Proceed to The Remaining Problem)

 Quest DescriptionAccording to Diona, the herbal soup made by samachurls can possibly be used to make an antidote to alcohol.
A Sobering Affair[]

Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 01.ogg Diona: Oh, you're back. Did you get the herbal soup?
 Got it right here.
 Can you really use this to make him sober up?
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 02.ogg Diona: Of course, I'll be using some other ingredients that counter intoxication as well. The herbal soup was meant to energize hilichurls, so I'm pretty sure it'll work on my old man, too.
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 03.ogg Diona: Hmm...
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 04.ogg Diona: However, I'm not going to mix the concoction myself, otherwise even that will turn out delicious.
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 05.ogg Diona: The concoction needs to be as potent as possible... Hey! Maybe you can mix it while I guide you!
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 06.ogg Diona: It's quite simple, just be sure to mix the ingredients evenly.
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 07.ogg Diona: The stronger it is, the more effective it will be.
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 08.ogg Diona: Let's get started mixing so we can sober him up.
You mix the potent concoction under Diona's guidance...
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 09.ogg Diona: *cough* Huh, you used up all the herbal soup, right?
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 10.ogg Diona: Okay, this should be... *cough* This should be enough... just keep it away from me! Oof, my nose can't take it!
 (What a horrible smell...)
 (Is this really drinkable...?)
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 11.ogg Diona: Hehe, bring it to my foolish father and have him drink it. Ooh, on second thought... just a good whiff should do the job!
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 01.ogg Draff: Now where's that *hic* hilihound...? C'mon now... here hili-hili-hili... *hic* Hehehe...
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 02.ogg Draff: What is it? A drink, huh? Hehe... is it alcohol!? Perfect... if I just *hic* have a little more, that hilihog won't ever outrun me... hehe...
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 03.ogg Draff: *sniff* *sniff*
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 04.ogg Draff: Ugh! What... is that...?
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 05.ogg Draff: *blagggh* *blagggh*
Draff wrenches over violently. It seems all the alcohol he drank has gone to waste...
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 06.ogg Draff: Oh... What... What is that!? Please, just — just get it away from me! My head is spinning...
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 12.ogg Diona: So? Are you sober now?
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 07.ogg Draff: Diona? Wh—What are you doing here? Huh...?
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 08.ogg Draff: Actually, what am I doing here? Ugh, I can't remember a thing, and that smell is so horrid that I can't even think straight!
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 13.ogg Diona: You drank too much and ran off here by yourself. Now that you've sobered up, let's get back to the entrance of the valley. Allan's waiting for us there.
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 14.ogg Diona: Uhhh... just leave that concoction here... I don't ever want to smell it again, phew! Besides, I doubt it can be used to make any drinks.
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 15.ogg Diona: ...But it does prove that the samachurls' herbal soup is potentially the best ingredient for making the worst possible drink!
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 09.ogg Draff: Allan... Oh! I remember now, I was here to hunt.
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 10.ogg Draff: Wait, th—that can't be right, there's no game to hunt here...
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 16.ogg Diona: You were on the hunt for hilihounds and hilihogs.
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 11.ogg Draff: Uh? What's that? A hili-what now?
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 17.ogg Diona: You literally were the one just talking about them... again! You seemed pretty proud about it too, like you were on an epic hunt or something.
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 12.ogg Draff: Really...? I must have had too much to drink again... I don't remember any of that. *sigh*
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 18.ogg Diona: Tch, typical you... Alright, let's hurry back and find Allan.
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 13.ogg Draff: Diona, you're not... angry, are you?
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 19.ogg Diona: Nope.
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 14.ogg Draff: *sigh* I don't remember a thing... I promise that I won't drink that much next time.
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 15.ogg Draff: All I remember is that I was out on a hunt with Allan and the others. We stopped somewhere nearby and started barbequing. I drank a little to celebrate all the game we caught...
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 16.ogg Draff: And the next thing I know, this traveler is making me smell that... thing...
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 20.ogg Diona: And?
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 17.ogg Draff: And... that's it. I don't remember anything else, was there something important?
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 21.ogg Diona: *Ugh*
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 draff 18.ogg Draff: Er— I— Oh, Diona, how about you give Daddy a little hint? C'mon now!
Media:vo dancop001 1910501 diona 22.ogg Diona: Nope! Forget it! Let's just go back and find Allan.
(Talk to Allan)
Media:vo dancop001 1910502 allan 01.ogg Allan: It's Diona and the Honorary Knight. You've brought Draff back!
Media:vo dancop001 1910502 allan 02.ogg Allan: Oh, what happened to you Draff? You look awful.
Media:vo dancop001 1910502 draff 01.ogg Draff: I was... sobered up. Don't worry. I'm fine now. I just need to go back and get some rest.
Media:vo dancop001 1910502 draff 02.ogg Draff: Allan, if you could... gimme a hand...
Media:vo dancop001 1910502 allan 03.ogg Allan: Oh, of course! Diona, Traveler... Thank you for all your help.
Media:vo dancop001 1910502 allan 04.ogg Allan: I will be taking Draff back to Springvale now.
Media:vo dancop001 1910502 allan 05.ogg Allan: He looks like he's going to have to rest for quite some time.
Media:vo dancop001 1910502 diona 01.ogg Diona: See... this is what happens when you drink, just remember that. No drinking!
 Don't worry, I'm not of age yet...
Media:vo dancop001 1910502 diona 02.ogg Diona: But who knows what'll happen in the future. Just remember, drinking causes nothin' but trouble.
Media:vo dancop001 1910502 diona 03.ogg Diona: Alcohol is poison, it makes people foolish and makes them do terrible things. It somehow brings out the worst side of the best people.
Media:vo dancop001 1910502 diona 04.ogg Diona: That includes incredible hunters like my daddy. After drinking, he's worse than a hilihog and hilihound, or whatever he calls those things.
Media:vo dancop001 1910502 diona 05.ogg Diona: Unfortunately, we used up all the herbal soup you managed to get just to sober him up.
Media:vo dancop001 1910502 diona 06.ogg Diona: But, no use cryin' over spilt milk. I'll have to make you a drink some other time.
Media:vo dancop001 1910502 diona 07.ogg Diona: Let's head back, it's getting late.

 Quest DescriptionKaveh decides to put aside his mother's notebook for now. You agree to take a walk around with him.
The Temple of Wisdom[]

Media:vo kvcop001 1907601 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Of all the places in the Akademiya, I remember this one most. When my studies got busy, I used to pull all-nighters here trying to finish my blueprints.
 You sound like you almost miss it.
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907601 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Heh, who doesn't miss their time at the Akademiya? Life was a lot simpler then, and we all had far less troubles.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907601 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: I created many designs that I thought were beautiful in the House of Daena. I drew whatever came to mind, since I didn't have to care about budget constraints, or turning them into reality.
 Why did you like to draw in the House of Daena?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907601 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Hmm, if I had to give a reason... It'd probably be because I like the ambiance here?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907601 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: The Akademiya also had a rule that allowed scholars to annotate any physical books they came across. As a result, the books here are chock-full of scholars' wisdom across many generations.
(While walking with Kaveh)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907601 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Here, this is a great example. This book, "History of Ancient Sumeru Architecture," contains some analysis that I did many years ago.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907601 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Huh? Why is Alhaitham's handwriting also in here? When did he ever read this book?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907601 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: Ah, I guess it's probably from when we worked on that research project together. Anyway, he probably never cared to tell you this, but the House of Daena is where Alhaitham and I first met.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907601 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: I came here to do my homework, and saw him sitting by himself next to that row of bookshelves. A group of Haravatat scholars were chatting near him, but he looked as if he was too lazy to join them. There was a pretty stark difference between him and all the rest of them.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907601 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: It was my fault for feeling bad for him. I thought he must have gotten into some kind of trouble, and went over to ask if he needed anything, not realizing that—
Media:vo kvcop001 1907601 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: Not realizing that you were in fact the one in a whole heap of trouble?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Alhaitham!? Why are you here?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: The House of Daena is a public space. Anyone can come here, no?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: But shouldn't you be at the records room at this hour? You're not here hoping to see me make a fool of myself, are you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: You think I would derive amusement from watching you fall into depression over your life's various troubles? If that's the case, then I suppose I must have been entertaining myself for years.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: I came here to pick up a few files. If your voice hadn't managed to get through my soundproof earpieces, I probably wouldn't have noticed you.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: Alright, alright, I admit I was probably overreacting just now.
 Well, want to continue the story?
 I want to know what happened next.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Uh, probably not when he's right here with us. As his senior, I shouldn't try to tarnish his reputation.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: There was nothing embarrassing or shameful about it.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: When I was still a student at the Akademiya, I once collaborated with Kaveh on a research project. A collaboration is usually beneficial for all parties, but due to issues with our personalities, we ended up going our separate ways before completing the project.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: We had a number of differences, and they remain unresolved even today, but there's no point going into that right now.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: The more important question is why are you at the House of Daena?
 Kaveh's feeling a little...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: Ahem! As a senior scholar, isn't it my responsibility to offer my friend a quick tour and explanation of the Akademiya's architecture?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: I see, then let me guess, your next stop will be the pavilions around Razan Garden? Our famed architect sure loves showing off that corner to all his friends.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: Oh, and Kaveh, a lot of the books you annotated have been moved to the innermost section of that bookshelf over there. You'll have to dig them out yourself if you need to find them.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Huh? But why would you know that? Don't tell me you've finally had an epiphany, and realized that there's great virtue in respecting your elders' work...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 10.ogg Alhaitham: Sure, if that will give you some self-confidence.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 11.ogg Alhaitham: Leave any words of thanks you may have to the ex-Grand Conservator. The last time he was here, he was complaining that he had received reports from current students — the main grievance being that "the annotations are too long and difficult to read."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 12.ogg Alhaitham: As a result, the books you annotated have been moved to the back shelves.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: What!? But all of my annotations were extremely important... Instead of reporting me, they should have been thanking me for my service! The notes that I took... They couldn't have asked for a better analysis of those books!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: Okay, just you wait, I'm going to fix this right now. I'll dig all the books out, and return them to the proper shelves!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 13.ogg Alhaitham: Heh. Oh, we'll wait.
 Waiting is about all we can do...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 14.ogg Alhaitham: Anyway, you were about to say he's feeling a bit down?
 He was put through the wringer recently by a particularly difficult client.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 15.ogg Alhaitham: "Put through the wringer" — what an interesting phrase. I assume he used those exact words himself.
 It doesn't seem far from the truth, though.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 16.ogg Alhaitham: He probably did suffer quite a bit, that's true. He always spends a lot of time editing his proposals, with the goal of satisfying as many of the client's preferences as possible.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 17.ogg Alhaitham: But the satisfaction of one client will not translate to general satisfaction with his work. Many problems in life can only be solved by a fundamental change of attitude. As the leading genius of Kshahrewar, Kaveh should have both the right and the confidence to reject any unreasonable demands.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 18.ogg Alhaitham: There are plenty of architects in Sumeru who are inferior to him in skill, yet far more irascible in temperament. What's more, there are plenty of people who look up to such individuals as paragons of "staying true to one's principles."
 So, the problem is with Kaveh...?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 19.ogg Alhaitham: Clearly, his predicament is inevitable, since he holds other people's feelings as more important than his own.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 20.ogg Alhaitham: Of course, each person is different, and we should respect the paths that they have chosen for themselves.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 21.ogg Alhaitham: Admonitions will serve no purpose. People tend to succumb to familiar pitfalls, and this is especially true for those who believe it's their duty to carry more burdens on their shoulders.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: Looks like you were having an enjoyable chat while I was gone. Were you talking about me by any chance?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 22.ogg Alhaitham: What do you think?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: Hmph, what else is there to talk about? Surely, no one would be interested in talking about the files that you were browsing through earlier.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: Anyway, you should take a look at this! Look at this comment on page eighty-two: "Dear Kaveh, thank you so much for annotating this book in such detail. It was a great help to me!"

Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: See that? Now that's how a student should treat their seniors!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 23.ogg Alhaitham: And it looks like you're already in a much better mood now. It really doesn't take much to make you happy, huh.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: Me? Happy? I'm mocking that retired blockhead for being so full of himself! He understands nothing about the true beauty of architecture! When I can find some time, I'll have a serious talk with him about making sure these books are put where they belong.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 24.ogg Alhaitham: Why don't you just move all the books yourself? It's not like he hasn't cursed you out before. What was that nickname he gave you while you were in the Akademiya? "The Urchin of Kshahrewar"?
 Wait, what?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 25.ogg Alhaitham: Kaveh had a habit of scribbling and writing in all kinds of books.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: Hey...! You didn't need to bring that up! At least not when I'm still standing here!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: Oh, actually, I also found a really old sketch in one of the books over there. See? Doesn't it remind you of something?
 An arch bridge?
 I don't really get it...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 26.ogg Alhaitham: ...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: Huh? Don't tell me even you don't get it.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 27.ogg Alhaitham: Hmm? Don't ask me. This is the time you specifically put aside to brag about yourself. Feel free to hoard all the spotlight you want.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: You... Ahem, in that case, allow me to explain. Although this sketch is a little abstract, you can plainly see from the road plans that this was an original concept for the expansion of Port Ormos.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 28.ogg Alhaitham: We can also plainly see that the designer was a huge fan of this project. It's the project he loves to talk about the most, second to the Palace of Alcazarzaray.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: If I don't keep bringing up the neat projects that I've done, how would anyone know that I was the one who did them in the first place?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: There shouldn't be any complaints about Port Ormos... If I remember correctly, the construction process was very smooth, everything was made ready ahead of time, and there were very few safety concerns.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 29.ogg Alhaitham: There are indeed no records of any complaints about this project. A most impressive achievement.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 20.ogg Kaveh: See? What did I tell you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 21.ogg Kaveh: C'mon, let's take a stroll through Port Ormos next! I'll tell you all about the designs I made for the place!
 Are you going to come too, Alhaitham?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 alhaitham 30.ogg Alhaitham: No need. It's almost time to clock out for the day, and I don't intend on bringing any unfinished work home.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907603 kaveh 22.ogg Kaveh: Hmph, suit yourself, it's not like you know how to appreciate artistry anyway. Let's go, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). I'll take you to Port Ormos.
(Read Almanac of Avidya Forest's Avians, optional)
Almanac of Avidya Forest's Avians: (The almanac contains information on all kinds of avian species in the Avidya Forest, with notes on their natural behavior and conservation status.)
Almanac of Avidya Forest's Avians: (A number of corrections have been made to the listed figures. Judging from the handwriting, they must have been pretty recent.)
(Read Evolution of Ancient Literature, optional)
Evolution of Ancient Literature: (A brand-new volume. Seems like very few people have been interested in reading it.)
Evolution of Ancient Literature: (There are almost no annotations in the book, but the daring speculation made by the original author has been unceremoniously crossed out by a reader.)
(Read "Graphical Illustrations of Ancient Architecture," optional)
"Graphical Illustrations of Ancient Architecture": (Upon opening the book, you are greeted by a series of beautiful illustrations.)
"Graphical Illustrations of Ancient Architecture": (Next to the lovely images are some notes in equally gorgeous handwriting. The commentary is extremely thorough, and appears to be even more professional than the book's original contents.)

Successes and Regrets[]

(Approach the marked area in Port Ormos)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Port Ormos...
 Did you design one of the buildings here?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: No, I didn't design any one specific building. Most of my work here concerned structural renovation.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: Port Ormos had already existed since I was still a young child. It wasn't as large as it is now, though — it only came to its current size after a sizable expansion. I was part of that project.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: The arch bridge over there, for example... That was one of my designs.
 How did you come up with the idea for it?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: When I was first tasked with the project, I decided to reference the growth patterns of nearby trees to split Port Ormos into two levels. My goal was to improve the overall utilization of space.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: We ran into a lot of issues during construction, but thankfully, we were still able to achieve the original vision.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Residents can now behold all the ships entering and leaving the harbor from the vantage point of the bridge, while visitors can recognize the sight of Port Ormos from a long ways away.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: I was still young and new to the trade back then... I could hardly believe that an idea in my head had become reality, and remain in the world for many years to come.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: The true cornerstone of the creative process... The point about the design that will be ultimately used to judge its true worth. It was the first time that it became crystal clear in my mind.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: Once built, a building will continue to stand. Countless people will see it, and countless more will step inside it. Its final worth — whether it's "good" or "bad" — will be assessed by the countless generations of people that interact with the building during their lives.
 I'm sure the residents of Port Ormos really enjoy it.
 I think it's pretty cool.
(+2 Hearts)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: You think so? I'm glad to hear that. But even with this project, I still had one small regret.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: My budget was tight, and I was unable to use the higher-quality timber I had originally intended for the design. I knew that some concessions on aesthetics would be needed because I agreed to a proposal that prioritized the practical functions of the project.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: Us creative types know better than anyone that most projects cannot be completed without a few regrets. Even the Palace of Alcazarzaray is not perfect.
 But having no regrets would also mean you had no higher hopes for the future.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: Yeah, you're right... I should learn to look toward future opportunities, and believe that any regrets I have can be overcome in time.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: We've spent long enough here. There's still one last place I want to go, but it's a little far... Would you be interested in a quick trip to the desert?
 I wouldn't mind.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: Great. Most of my projects over the last few years have had something to do with the desert, partially because there's a special place there that I often visit.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: This is a rare opportunity, so why don't you come along and see it for yourself?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907604 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: If you ever feel down, maybe you'll be able to go there and feel better, too.

Desert Sanctum[]

(At The Dune of Magma)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907605 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Who would have thought that so many Primal Constructs could have congregated here while I was gone...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907605 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: We won't be able to sit and talk peacefully with these guys around. Let's clear the area.
(After clearing out the enemies)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Isn't this place great? I often come here to clear my mind when I'm dealing with a difficult situation.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: You know what I mean... everyone finds themselves in frustrating situations once in a while.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: Just take me as an example. My family life got shaken up quite a bit when I was young, I struggled in school, and I got into a huge pile of debt building the Palace of Alcazarzaray...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Although Alhaitham thinks that it's because of my personality that I continue to live in the shadow of the past, I think it's also just a part of life... Plus, if I look back, I've honestly had my fair share of good luck as well.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: You could probably say I've followed in the path of my mother. Like her, I've gained a name for myself as an architect, built something that's seen as my magnum opus, and found many projects that others have entrusted to me to finish.
 You also haven't completely lost your passion for life.
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Life is too boring when you live with no enthusiasm and passion. Only those who believe in the inherent meaning of it can capture the small nuances of everyday life, and turn them into inspiration for beautiful designs.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Of course, I will concede that loving something also means taking it to heart, so to an extent, caring is also a source of pain. If I didn't love my work, I wouldn't be so torn up about it all the time.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: ...But still, isn't this place beautiful? Despite the erosion from the winds and changing seasons, you can still perceive its past beauty and glory.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: With different landforms come different architectural styles. The desert's history has left it with few records regarding its buildings, so I often visit the desert to investigate things in person.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: The sight here has moved me ever since the first time I laid my eyes on it. I told myself that one day, I would also be able to create buildings that move others.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: My pain will one day fade into nothing just as I reach the end of my life, but buildings are different.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: They are far more valuable than most materialistic things, and far more durable than human flesh. As long as there remain souls in the world who can decipher the meaning behind them, they will also have acknowledged me across the vast stream of time.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: If you were to ask me what art is, that would be my answer.
 Now that's more like the Kaveh I know.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: You think so? But I feel I've always been like this.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: Remember that question I brought up before? The one about whether I should see art as a divine gift of inspiration from the gods, or as a product of my own existential struggle?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: I still haven't found an answer to that yet, but if art wasn't inherently paradoxical and enigmatic, then people probably wouldn't be drawn to it.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: Those who pursue art will be unable to avoid the pain that it naturally brings. We'll often be floating on cloud nine one second, and sinking in a mire the next.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: I'll try gathering my thoughts again once I've found a way to define art in the first place.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907607 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: In any case, thank you so much for listening to everything I had to say.

The Missive Locked Away[]

(Approach the marked location)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Hmm, what am I supposed to do now... Forget it, I'll just head back.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Tighnari? What are you doing here?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Oh, it's you! Good to finally see you again.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: I came into the city to buy some experiment reagents, hoping to bring them back with me to Gandharva Ville.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: But as soon as I got here, I noticed someone banging on Cyrus' door. You've all heard of Cyrus, right? He's an ex-sage and Cyno's adoptive father.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: I was thinking about going over to ask what's happening. That granny over there may appear old and frail, but her vocal cords certainly sound loud and healthy as ever.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: ...Granny?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: Yeah, she's just over there. You can go check out the situation yourselves in a moment.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: *sniff* Kaveh, were you at the tavern?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: I had a quick drink or two. Can you still smell the alcohol?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Drinking in broad daylight... Really? You want to pass out by the road and get run over by a Sumpter Beast like some mindless Fungus? Huh?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: And you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). You didn't try to stop him?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Uh... I...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: You look like a wreck, Kaveh. What happened? Are you feeling down again?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: You know what, I'm hosting a meal at Pardis Dhyai tomorrow evening. Do you want to come?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: Huh? Oh, I had no idea... Let me think for a moment. Uh, I'll come if I can find some time.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 12.ogg Tighnari: Alright, then I'll plan on reserving two seats for you.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 13.ogg Tighnari: I'll be heading back to Gandharva Ville for now. I have a feeling that argument over there is gonna continue for quite some time. It might be best if we don't get involved.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907701 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: A granny who lives nearby... Let's go take a look.
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Zaha Hadi, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19077 zahahadi 01.ogg Zaha Hadi: (My tomato! I know Cyrus is the one who picked it!)
(Approach Zaha Hadi)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 01.ogg Zaha Hadi: Hah, so plan on keeping yourself locked in there, huh? Fine by me, if you're not going to come out, then I'm not going to leave!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 02.ogg Zaha Hadi: My tomato was growing so well — it had all the potential to become the best tomato this year... And you cut it straight from the vine!?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 spantamadcyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: I already told you, I had nothing to do with it! Why would I take a tomato that's still weeks from ripening?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 spantamadcyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: You'd have to be awfully "green" as an investigator to think it was me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 03.ogg Zaha Hadi: ...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 spantamadcyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: You see, the word "green" here could refer both to the color of the tomato, and the fact that your skills could use some—
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 04.ogg Zaha Hadi: Enough nonsense. Just come out and face me, you coward!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 spantamadcyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: You're out of your mind. If I've actually done something wrong, then get a matra and pull me out by force, why don't ya!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 05.ogg Zaha Hadi: Why you—
 Don't tell me this is...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Professor Zaha Hadi?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 06.ogg Zaha Hadi: And who are you— Oh, Kaveh! Fancy seeing you here!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 07.ogg Zaha Hadi: How long has it been? C'mon, get over here and let the Professor take a good look at you... Not bad, not bad. You've grown taller again!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Um... Professor, what's going on here?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 08.ogg Zaha Hadi: Ah, it's no big deal, really. A few of us old scholars got bored in our retirement, and decided to put together a vegetable growing competition. At the end, whoever loses will have to go up on stage and do a performance for the winners.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 09.ogg Zaha Hadi: Which brings us to our current predicament... Hehe, my tomato was sure to win until a certain someone decided they couldn't bear to lose.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 spantamadcyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: Hey, don't try to defame me in front of the kids! If we're airing each other's dirty laundry now, then why don't we talk about you sneaking into Jannat's garden the other night—
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 10.ogg Zaha Hadi: Ahem! Lucky for you, seeing these youngsters come to pay their respects today has put me in a better mood. I'll let you off the hook for now.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 11.ogg Zaha Hadi: C'mon, let's go. We'll take our conversation elsewhere. He doesn't need to be a part of it.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: A—Ah yes, of course.
(Knock on Cyrus' door, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907702 spantamadcyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Stop trying to break down my door, Zaha Hadi! You know I'm not going to come out!
(Approach the marked location)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 01.ogg Zaha Hadi: Is Faranak still doing well?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Yes, as far as I know. She left for Fontaine some time ago, and started a new life for herself. She's still doing work related to architecture, though.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 02.ogg Zaha Hadi: Ah yes, I did hear about that. Did that upset you at all?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: No, not at all. She's already sacrificed a lot raising me as a single mother.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 03.ogg Zaha Hadi: That's good to hear. Your mother did struggle quite a bit those few years... It's probably a good thing that she found a new place to call home.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 04.ogg Zaha Hadi: Sometimes I wonder if things were harder for her because she was so beautiful. People were always drawn to her beauty first, only to realize she had a sensitive and vulnerable heart underneath.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 05.ogg Zaha Hadi: She was still quite young when she first joined my class as a student. Beautiful and radiant with her golden hair, yet quiet and single-minded, she seemed like a lass from some aristocratic house who was seeing the outside world for the first time.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 06.ogg Zaha Hadi: She had to make a lot of drastic changes in her life to raise you on her own.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 07.ogg Zaha Hadi: Even during her time in the Akademiya, she was a thorough perfectionist. If she was unsatisfied with something she had made, she'd insist on redoing it even if I was perfectly happy with it.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 08.ogg Zaha Hadi: She had many admirers, and they'd always fill up the first few rows of seats, hoping they could get closer to her sitting in the first row. If it were any of my other classes, you'd have found nobody sitting in the front.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 09.ogg Zaha Hadi: But every time I saw her, she was always in that same rigid pose. She'd have one hand on her forehead, with the other clutching her pencil. Her eyebrows would be knitted in a frown as she concentrated on the blueprint in front of her.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: I'm sure she had many difficult moments in her life, how did she cope with the stress?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 10.ogg Zaha Hadi: I'm not too sure, she never talked about such things with me. She rarely opened up to other people, you know.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 11.ogg Zaha Hadi: I do remember one time though when she got into a heated argument with a friend. She said something that I found very memorable.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 12.ogg Zaha Hadi: She said: "True art cannot be understood, but as an artist, I wish some people could understand its meaning and value."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 13.ogg Zaha Hadi: If you ask me, that's probably the greatest source of pain for geniuses of their craft. It's extremely hard for them to find someone who can truly understand their ideas.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: So that's how it is, hmm... I wonder if the password could be...
 "Understanding"?
 "Acknowledgment"?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: Hmm... I tried both just now. Seems those aren't it, either.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 14.ogg Zaha Hadi: What are you trying to do?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: My mother left her notebook to me, but it has a password and I haven't figured out what it is yet. I'm trying to learn more about her so I'd have a better chance at cracking the code... Thank you for all that you told us.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 15.ogg Zaha Hadi: Haha, it's the least I can do. Talking to youngsters like yourself makes me feel younger, too. Honestly, looking at you now, I can see how much you resemble her... It's almost as if she's standing right in front of me again.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 16.ogg Zaha Hadi: Your personalities are quite alike, too. You're both stubborn, and both a little awkward. Of course, I'm sure the similarities are mostly superficial... but so long as you continue to harbor those traits, you'll find a lot of difficulties in your work.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 17.ogg Zaha Hadi: I've taught a lot of students over my career, and in my experience, very few genius architects of Kshahrewar ever found happiness for themselves.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 18.ogg Zaha Hadi: They would know exactly what they want to express, and fight for it tooth and nail, which inevitably led to arguments with their clients.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 19.ogg Zaha Hadi: Some clients would choose to respect the architects' vision, or just let the argument go because of the architects' reputation, but those are the rare ones.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 20.ogg Zaha Hadi: When Faranak first graduated, she was getting into arguments with her clients nearly every single day. I think it only got a little better when she met your father.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: I see... But could he understand the designs my mother made?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 21.ogg Zaha Hadi: No, I think they were probably beyond him, too. But despite that, he still stayed next to her, listening to her joys and sharing in her sorrows.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 22.ogg Zaha Hadi: Faranak had many admirers, but she ended up choosing your father. His support probably played a part in that decision.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: Hmm... So instead of "understanding," perhaps all we need is just "companionship"...
 Maybe that's what she was trying to tell you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: ...Huh, it worked!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 23.ogg Zaha Hadi: Oh, was that the right password?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: Yes!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 24.ogg Zaha Hadi: Then you should be on your way, child. Find a quiet place and see what she wanted to say to you.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 25.ogg Zaha Hadi: Being the awkward person that she is, I suppose there were many things that Faranak could never say out loud. Instead, she probably left them in her diary hoping that they would make their way to you one day.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 26.ogg Zaha Hadi: If you're ever in a mood to chat again, just come and find me here. You're always welcome to discuss architecture topics with me as well.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: Thank you so much, Professor.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 27.ogg Zaha Hadi: Haha, there's no need to be so formal. I'll let you kids go. It's time for me to take another stroll around the vegetable garden.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: I wonder what my mother could have written about...
Kaveh starts quickly flipping through the notebook, revealing lines upon lines of elegant handwriting.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 01.ogg Faranak: "They all say Zaha Hadi's class is the toughest, but I think it's actually not too bad. On the other hand, though, structural mechanics is definitely a pain no matter how you try to approach it... I doubled down and managed to get through it in the end."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 02.ogg Faranak: "I met someone special. At first, I didn't think much of him, but now I feel very happy whenever I get to spend time with him."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 03.ogg Faranak: "We decided to name our son Kaveh. I don't think a younger me would have ever imagined forming such an intimate bond with another person... Back then, I lived only in the shadow of myself, as well as that of the dream in my heart."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 04.ogg Faranak: "The bad news came, and even though it's been several days now, I still can't bring myself to come to terms with what happened. My eyes are so swollen that it's hard to see. What if they are all lying to me, and this is just a long, cruel dream?"
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 05.ogg Faranak: "But I have to face reality. I still have someone to take care of. No matter what happens, I'll do my best to raise my son on my own."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: ...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: Huh? Is this... a drawing? Seems like it was done by my mother.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: This blonde man was probably my father... But who are the other people in the picture? Huh? Why do a few of them look somewhat familiar...
 Yeah, they do seem familiar...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: From the dates in the notebook, she probably drew this more than thirty years ago. I hadn't even been born yet.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: ...Maybe we were thinking too much. Oh! There are a few lines written in the diary about this as well.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 06.ogg Faranak: "The one who invited us to the gathering is a talkative woman. Including us, three couples showed up... There was also a person who came alone."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 07.ogg Faranak: "The talkative woman introduced everyone to each other. She spoke really quickly, so I couldn't quite catch everything she said, but I also didn't feel like asking her to repeat herself."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 08.ogg Faranak: "My husband seems to be friends with the man with long ears. I couldn't really join their conversation, so I've resigned myself to sitting in a corner and drawing in my notebook."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 09.ogg Faranak: "I don't think I'd be able to become friends with any of these people... especially that stiff-looking couple."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 10.ogg Faranak: "That man is certainly very handsome, but he would constantly alternate between disjointed and serious ways of talking... His wife is a bit more bearable."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 11.ogg Faranak: "We were not acquainted with each other to begin with, and I doubt we'll see each other again after this gathering. The ambiance of this gathering is surprisingly pleasant, however. Talking to people can allow us to find some peace after a long day."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 12.ogg Faranak: "Maybe my son will also partake in these gatherings in the future. I hope he'll be able to make many friends."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: Who would have thought my mother used to attend that kind of thing... It seemed she was only good at talking about her own work, and found it difficult to join into other conversations. As a result, she often kept to herself and would be off to the side drawing.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: There's more written on the back... Oh, it seems like it was written to me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 13.ogg Faranak: "Kaveh, I was both overjoyed and distressed when I learned of your decision to continue your studies in Kshahrewar."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 14.ogg Faranak: "You are very talented, and I am confident that you will become an architect of much acclaim. However, the more talented you are as an artist, the more misery and anguish you may encounter."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 15.ogg Faranak: "No one will be able to help you during your journey as an artist. But outside of your life as a creator, you can learn to form connections with other people, and enjoy many other things in life. It's the only way to alleviate your suffering."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 16.ogg Faranak: "Whenever you feel down, seek out a friend to sit and have a chat. You can accumulate joy and fulfillment by spending time with them. The positive feelings you gain will get you through the long and difficult years. Never forget that companionship is the most important thing of all."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 20.ogg Kaveh: So that's the answer she prepared for me... She really thought long and hard about me and my future.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 21.ogg Kaveh: Well, now that I've read her words... Do you think I should accept Tighnari's invite, and attend that dinner at Pardis Dhyai?
 Wait, you were actually considering not going?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 22.ogg Kaveh: Uh... The thought had definitely crossed my mind.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 23.ogg Kaveh: Although it'd be nice to get together with friends and chat the night away... I don't want to bring down other people's moods because I'm sad.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 24.ogg Kaveh: Besides, don't most people hate the feeling of seeing their friends troubled and being unable to help? And what's worse, nearly all of my problems can't be easily resolved with some encouraging words or gesture.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 25.ogg Kaveh: And don't forget, I'm also older than all of them... As their senior, I should appear to be a bit more responsible.
 But Tighnari saw right through you.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 26.ogg Kaveh: Ah, you're right... *sigh* I really didn't expect to run into him here. I swear, his nose must be just as sensitive as his ears...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 27.ogg Kaveh: Well then, I guess... it's best that we go and join him for dinner. *sigh* That means I'll owe him yet another meal now...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 31.ogg Kaveh: You know what, I'm not going to overthink it. I'll see you tomorrow at Pardis Dhyai!
 It's normal for friends to take care of each other.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 28.ogg Kaveh: You're not wrong, but I keep feeling like I haven't really helped them much in return...
 It's always fun to have you around, Kaveh.
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 29.ogg Kaveh: Wait, do you mean it? You're not... making fun of me, are you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 30.ogg Kaveh: I've gotten so used to sarcasm that I can't tell what's genuinely a compliment anymore. Wait! By "fun," did you mean...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 31.ogg Kaveh: You know what, I'm not going to overthink it. I'll see you tomorrow at Pardis Dhyai!
(Observe Zaha Hadi, optional)
Observe Zaha Hadi: (Zaha Hadi is still arguing back and forth with Cyrus. It seems that they're not actually angry anymore, but just arguing to pass the time.)
(Zaha Hadi idle line)
Media:vo kvcop001 19077 zahahadi 02.ogg Zaha Hadi: Haha, we'll see how long you can stay cooped up in there!
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Zaha Hadi, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19077 zahahadi 03.ogg Zaha Hadi: (Maybe I'll pay a little visit to Cyrus' vegetable garden...)
Companionship, the Sole Antidote[]
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Cyno, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19077 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: (Once dinner's over, I'll tell them the joke I came up with yesterday.)
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Tighnari, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19077 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: (We'll need to put our heads together about Collei's studies...)
(Approach Cyno and Tighnari at Pardis Dhyai)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Alhaitham also got my invite, right? Will he be coming to join us?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Hmph, that guy? He's never been a fan of social gatherings. I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Are you sure? ...Alright then, I guess we won't wait for him.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Yeah, let's go! ...Uh, I mean, maybe we should give him a little more time. We can keep chatting for a while longer.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Oh, sure.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: You still haven't told me... What's the occasion for getting us together here at Pardis Dhyai?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: We're celebrating the end of the first phase of Collei's studies. I wanted to thank you all for the help you've given her along the way.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Then... Where's Collei?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: She said she wanted to show everyone a bit of what she's learned, so she's still doing some last-minute prep at home. She'll be here shortly.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: Anyway, let's get started... *sigh* To tell you the truth, I'm actually not so confident that the second phase will go as well as the first.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: The curriculum will become a lot more involved, and I'm worried that she won't be able to get through all of it. I was hoping we could brainstorm about it together before she gets here.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: I knew this wouldn't be just a simple free dinner... Is that why you also invited Alhaitham?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Yes, I thought it would be good if we could all put our heads together about this.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: Anyway, let's take a quick trip down memory lane. What did you guys do when you ran into a problem that you didn't know how to solve, or got assigned a project that you knew you weren't going to finish on time?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: Never happened to me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: I'd just pull another all-nighter.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: You two are hopeless... Does anyone have a more useful answer to the question?
 Perhaps you could adjust the pace of the curriculum?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Ooh! That's a good point! Confidence is the most important thing. Once you lose your sense of confidence, it'll become all but impossible to find the motivation to study.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: Hmm, this could be a potential direction. I have already redesigned the literacy curriculum, and I was originally hoping to ask Alhaitham for his opinion, but...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: It's very simple. Instead of focusing on the amount of material you would like to teach, focus on the amount the student would be able to remember.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Wow, you actually showed up! I could probably count the number of times you've actually come to gatherings like this on just one hand.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: It's still more than the number of times you've managed to get a proposal approved on the first try.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: Hmph, as long as you're still aware. So, what made the difference this time? Are you looking to drink your sorrows away with some friends?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: That's your purpose for being here, not mine. Don't project your ways of thinking onto me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: So you're saying the only reason you came is to help Tighnari with his brainstorming?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: Precisely. Collei will have a long road in front of her.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: Hey, just to get one thing clear, even if Collei manages to make her way to the Akademiya, we cannot let her enroll in Haravatat! Kshahrewar is obviously the best choice for her. She's been a trainee forest ranger for so long, she'll definitely be good with her hands.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: What are you saying? Spantamad is the better choice. It's where I graduated from, after all.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: Then what about Amurta? That's the Darshan her master actually graduated from.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: There are only two other Darshans left. We might as well select all of them on her enrollment application.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: You...! I'm trying to have a serious discussion here!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), you aren't associated with any of the six Darshans. In your opinion, which Darshan would be the best choice for Collei?
 I think she should get through the second phase of her studies first.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: Well said.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 12.ogg Tighnari: Agreed. And my goal in inviting you here was to gather some thoughts on the execution of this second phase.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: Phase two far exceeds phase one in both curriculum complexity and the speed of instruction. I hope Collei has prepared herself for what is coming.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: Hey, what are you thinking now? Please don't tell me you're planning on lending her those abstruse books from your home library.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: Actually, I was thinking about lending her a professions guide.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: I'll make sure to write "DON'T BECOME AN ARCHITECT" on the front page of that.
 But don't you love your job, Kaveh?
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: Hehe. You're right, I can't deny that.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Is there another phase after phase two? What's the ultimate goal of all of this? Are we trying to prepare her for a job in the Akademiya?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 13.ogg Tighnari: Ah, we don't need to think that far ahead. Hold that thought, though. I think my vegetables are done...
Everyone enjoys a relaxed and pleasant dinner...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: I'm telling you, that client had no idea what he was talking about! No matter what I did, he had something bad to say about it!
 (Kaveh sure gets drunk fast...)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 14.ogg Tighnari: Have you considered finding another client?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: Ah, they're all the same. I haven't had a good night's sleep for months now! Hmph, who do they think they are, ordering me to alter my design over and over again just because they have some Mora?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: It's too late now to change careers. You might as well try to find some joy in the pain.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: Besides, you'll be getting up in the middle of the night to make edits to your own design even when the client doesn't request it.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: No... *hic* ...that's not true!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: Cheer up, Kaveh. I'll tell you a new joke.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 15.ogg Tighnari: We'll save that for the end, Cyno. You can keep it to yourself until then.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 20.ogg Kaveh: I... Whatever! I'm not going to use my brain anymore! Let's drink tonight to our hearts' content!

 Quest DescriptionYou tell Sayu that she needs enough nutrition to grow tall. She follows you enthusiastically to Inazuma City...Sayu's eaten a lot already, but her height remains the same. Still, she isn't ready to give up yet...The process of eating to grow taller is rather painful, so you try to get Sayu to try something else — exercise. Will you succeed this time?
Recharge Plan[]

(Go to Kiminami Restaurant)
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: *sniffs* Oh, something smells amazing here! It smells so good that I'd even wake up to find where it's coming from!
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 kiminamianna 01.ogg Kiminami Anna: Welcome to Kiminami Restaurant! What can I get for the two of you?
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Oh, hmm... Lemme think. I'll have Rice Cake Soup, a Tuna Sushi, a Tricolor Dango... Oh, and one Tri-Flavored Skewer, please.
 Don't you think that's a bit much for you?
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Time waits for no one, it's time for me to take things into my own hands. If I can't grow more by eating more, then we'll still have time to try something else.
 Makes sense.
 It seems you've really put a lot of thought into this.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: I've always taken a proactive approach to growing taller. I can even overcome my sleepiness if I need to.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: Speaking of which, I've never been able to eat very much in one sitting. I thought I could try and see what my limits are this time.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: But... if I can't finish it all, would you help me...
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: Ugh, no! That's no good... I've got to stay positive, I know I can finish it all.
 Don't worry, I'll help you finish whatever's left.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: Yay, thanks! That way, I don't have to worry about any of the food going to waste.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: Eating food like this will help me grow right away, won't it? Maybe I'll gain a whole 6 inches!
 Let's not get too optimistic, growing takes time.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Yeah, you might be right. Let's eat everything up and find out.
Sayu tries very hard and finishes all the dishes by herself.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: *hiccup* Ugh...
 Are you feeling okay?
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: I'm alright... Don't worry about me...
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: I'm just a bit full, that's all... Ugh, I can't move.
 Pretty sure that means you're not okay.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: Ugh, I don't feel like I'm getting taller at all. If anything, I'm only growing wider.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: But if that's the price of getting taller, then I'm willing to pay it.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Okay... Time to order some more Dango.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Dango... Yes, more Dango...
 Uh, are you okay?
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: I think the Dango are making a swirl reaction in my tummy...
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 19.ogg Sayu: Urgh, who knew Dango could pack such a punch.
 If you eat any more, I think you might burst.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 20.ogg Sayu: Ugh, I just don't get it...
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 21.ogg Sayu: Why does growing have to be so difficult!?
 Do you still wish to continue?
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 Eating like this might have a negative effect on your health. Maybe we should consider some other options.
(Proceed to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 Do you still wish to continue?
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 29.ogg Sayu: Let's keep at it. No pain, no gain!
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 30.ogg Sayu: But maybe I could try some other food... All the stuff we just ordered is starting a swirl reaction in my tummy.
 Alright, then follow me.
 We shouldn't bite more than we can chew.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 31.ogg Sayu: Yeah, I understand.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 32.ogg Sayu: Remember, not too fast now... Oof, my tummy hurts!
(Proceed to Hard Work Pays Off)
(Talk to Kiminami Anna again)
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 kiminamianna 01.ogg Kiminami Anna: She did eat quite a lot, will she be okay?
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 kiminamianna 02.ogg Kiminami Anna: You should keep an eye on her, just in case.

Hard Work Pays Off[]

(Go to Shimura's)
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Lesson learned... Next time, only order one dish. If we finish it, then we can order another...
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: That would be a better plan, wouldn't it?
 It seems you've reached your limit. How about we take a break?
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: No way, I won't give up. Some things can never be achieved until you push yourself.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: If I can't eat any more, then we can always order some tea.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: My body needs to get the signal that I'm trying to grow taller.
 It can be hard to be nimble with a full stomach.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Yeah, I'm a little worried about that, too...
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: Ninja must be quick on their feet. It'd be embarrassing to get stuck in a tight passageway.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: But my body will feel my desire to grow and direct all the nutrients to the right place.
 Uh, good luck with that.
 I'm not sure if it'll be that easy.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: I've already eaten this much, I can't give up now!
Sayu makes herself gobble the two dishes up.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Ugh, that's it, I'm done... Growing is more painful than I thought.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: We still have two Radishes left over. Would you mind finishing them?
 Sure thing. I've been waiting for a chance to help.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: No, wait a second. Let me think...
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: On second thought, let me try to eat more.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: Otherwise, I'll feel like I didn't give it my best shot. I should at least eat one more.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: Then, I'll call it quits. No more trying to grow by eating.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Whew, alright... Here it goes.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: Sayu? Where are you, Sayu? Come out this instant!
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Uh oh! It's the shrine maiden! Not good...
 We've been out for too long.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: She's coming this way! What should we do!?
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 19.ogg Sayu: There's only one option now... I'll lead her away from here and try to shake her off my trail. We'll meet back here later.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 20.ogg Sayu: I'll just slip away and... Ugh, oh no! My tummy... it's too full...
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 21.ogg Sayu: Whoa!

Everything in Moderation


Aether
Lumine







Escape is Sayu's bread-and-butter, but this time, her attempt ends in failure.

Branch 2[]

 Eating like this might have a negative effect on your health. Maybe we should consider some other options.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 22.ogg Sayu: But are there any other options? ...I never thought that eating could be so painful.
 We could always try doing some training.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 23.ogg Sayu: Ugh, believe me, I already know everything there is about training.
 Kids that love running and jumping everywhere give a strong impression that they are going to grow a lot.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 24.ogg Sayu: Hmm, you do have a point...
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 25.ogg Sayu: Now that I think about it, the tallest ninja in the Shuumatsuban always seems to be training their ninjutsu and accepting extremely difficult tasks.
 Maybe sleep has only had the opposite effect on you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 26.ogg Sayu: No, no, that can't be it... Actually, I haven't kept a good balance of sleep and training, but that's because I feel sleepy way more often than I feel energetic!
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 27.ogg Sayu: Hmm, I get it now. I need to do more training with you. Adventuring, combat — I need to do it all!
 Why don't you come with me and see if the Adventurers' Guild has any commissions for us to handle?
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 kiminamianna 02.ogg Kiminami Anna: Pardon my eavesdropping, but did you say that you're going to the Adventurers' Guild to take a commission?
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 kiminamianna 03.ogg Kiminami Anna: Recently, we've been running into a group of rowdy Treasure Hoarders whenever we go into the wild to gather ingredients. It seems as if they're intentionally targeting our restaurant staff. *sigh* I hope you can understand how dire the situation has become.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 kiminamianna 04.ogg Kiminami Anna: This matter has been taking a real toll on our business. Since I've already submitted the commission to Katheryne, perhaps you can consider helping us out?
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 28.ogg Sayu: Treasure Hoarders, huh? Well, bad guys are the best practice targets for ninjutsu.
 Okay! We'll take care of it.
 I guess our post-meal plans are settled then.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 kiminamianna 05.ogg Kiminami Anna: Great, you have my thanks! Let me show you where the Treasure Hoarders have been most active these days.
(Proceed to Exercise Follows Eating)
(Talk to Kiminami Anna again)
Media:vo zycop001 1901303 kiminamianna 01.ogg Kiminami Anna: Thanks again for offering your help. Please do be careful out there.

Exercise Follows Eating[]

(Go to the Treasure Hoarders' camp)
Media:vo zycop001 1901303 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Anna was right, there's the Treasure Hoarders.
Media:vo zycop001 1901303 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: All that food we just ate is weighing me down a bit, but I think we can still handle them.

(After the battle)
Media:vo zycop001 1901308 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Alright, last one. Watch this!
Media:vo zycop001 1901308 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Oh no, aaaaaaah!
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: *whimpers*
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: How... How could this happen?
 What's wrong?
 Are you injured?
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: No, it's all that big brute's fault. Just as I was taking care of the last of them, he charged straight at me!
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: I moved back to dodge him, but he was too tall... As he reached out to grab me, his hand landed right on my head.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: It's over... It's all over. All that hard work for nothing. Ugh, he crossed the line... Everyone knows that if you're trying to grow taller, you can't be touched on the head.
 You're saying getting patted on the head can stunt your growth?
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Of course! I never let anyone touch my head. Who knows how much I'll have to eat and sleep or how much training I'll have to do to make up for it.
 I don't think that will stop you from growing.
 You're just assuming things.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: Ugh, it's a real bummer, you know. *sigh* I see you're just trying to comfort me. Thanks...
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: It's not fun to be patted on the head. But what's done is done, there's nothing I can do about it now.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: Uh, just forget it, I give up on growing. I'm not gonna grow any taller today, that's for sure.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Sorry, I don't want to bum you out with my terrible mood. I should probably just go back now. The shrine maiden's gonna give me a real earful, might as well get it over with.
 There's a saying, you know: All good things come to those who wait.
 It simply takes time to grow.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: I get it... I'll try to look at the bright side.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: I was too anxious about growing and now I'm being punished by the archons.
 I have another idea, Sayu.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: No, no need. I don't want to trouble you anymore. Maybe my stunted growth is tied to my bad attitude more than anything else.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: Getting you involved any further will just be a waste of your time.
 Though you might not be growing taller now, you can still experience the feeling of growing.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: Huh? "The feeling of growing"... What do you mean?
 Imagine, after you grow taller, you can reach higher places and see much farther, right?
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Yeah, that's exactly what I'm after.
 Alright then, come with me. I promise you'll feel better.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Reach higher and see farther... really?
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: Sounds good, I appreciate all your help.

Not As Planned[]

(Go to a high spot to relax with Sayu)
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: You had me worried on the way here, you know. I seriously wondered if you were taking me to the Kamisato residence or the shrine...
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: But you weren't kidding, I can see much farther from here.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Somehow I feel a little better after coming up so high.
 Is there anything in particular that you'd like to do after you grow taller?
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: No, nothing particularly special. I'd simply like to go to the forest and pick some fruit from the trees without having to jump or find something to step on. Just that would be enough to make me happy.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: I'd also like to go swimming in water that's too deep for me now, and no one will tease me anymore for my toes not being able to touch the bottom.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Oh, oh! And I'll be able to eat more, too, and stop wasting food all the time.
 I suppose being taller will make things easier for you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: Oh! And not to mention I'll become more free, too!
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: I won't need to have a guardian to look after me, and the shrine maiden won't be out to catch me anymore.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: I'll even be able to visit other places for training. I'll go wherever I want and sleep wherever I want!
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Ah, imagine, no need to catch up on naps anymore. That will be the day...
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: By the way, do you happen to need anyone with ninjutsu skills to accompany you on your adventures?
 Adventuring is a grueling experience.
 Adventuring is not a game.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: Hm, see? You still see me by my current height. Hmph! Who knows, maybe I'll be even taller than you one day!
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: Just wait till I'm taller. You won't need to worry about me ever again, hehe.
 See? You're already in a better mood.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: Yeah, you're right. Thanks.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: From now on, I'll visit high places more often. They really do work miracles.
 This isn't the highest you can achieve, you know.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Huh? What do you mean?
 You can still reach even higher and see even farther, but you can't do that just by standing here.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Oh, I see. So what should I do?
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: Huh? Wh—Wh—Whoaaaa!

Midnight Meeting[]
 Quest DescriptionYun Jin wandered into a perilous place while searching for inspiration, and would have been in trouble if not for your intervention. To thank you, she agrees to meet you after her performance...

(Talk to Shiyun or Boi before meeting Yun Jin, optional)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903751 shiyun 02.ogg Shiyun: Ms. Yun's performance was amazing! Especially the silk dance. Did you see it...?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903751 boyi 02.ogg Boyi: Uh, yeah, sure I did... but how do I work that into an article?
(Talk to Clerk Zhao any time during the quest, optional)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903752 clerkzhao 02.ogg Clerk Zhao: Just wonderful... Oh, no! I'm late for my meeting!
(Talk to Guan Hong any time during the quest, optional)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903753 guanhong 02.ogg Guan Hong: Hmm? What're you up to? Did you just arrive after the show was over?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903753 guanhong 03.ogg Guan Hong: Haha. Sorry, friend, but if you missed Yun Jin's show, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life!
(Talk to Changhu any time during the quest, optional)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903754 changhu 02.ogg Changhu: How very strange. I don't usually feel anything when listening to Liu Su's stories. But once Yun Jin started singing, I was completely spellbound...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903754 changhu 03.ogg Changhu: Wait... Master? Master! Where have you gone, Master?
(Talk to Fan Er'ye any time during the quest, optional)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903755 fanerye 02.ogg Fan Er'ye: Voice of an angel, delicate as a murmuring stream...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903755 fanerye 03.ogg Fan Er'ye: The moment Yun Jin got on the stage, it took me right back... Oh, the resemblance was... *sigh*... What a captivating performance.

(Wait for the performance to end before meeting up, 20:00–23:00 the next day)
(Meet Yun Jin)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 maksim 01.ogg Maksim: Liyue opera is really something... But Liyue opera performed by Ms. Yun — now that's something else!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 maksim 02.ogg Maksim: Thrilling performance. I've never seen anything like it before in my life. Your reputation is well-deserved!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 gentrymaocai 01.ogg Gentry Maocai: Haha. Well, I've had the pleasure of seeing the talented Ms. Yun on stage many a time in the past, but the songs still sound fresh and new every single time.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 gentrymaocai 02.ogg Gentry Maocai: It's been barely a few days since I last saw you perform, but once again, Yun Jin, you've progressed by leaps and bounds.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: You're far too kind, both of you.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: I'm still new to the profession, but I promised myself when I joined the troupe that I would strive to develop myself as a performer every day.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: And I wouldn't be where I am now without everyone's faithful support...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 maksim 03.ogg Maksim: Nonsense! You're too humble, Ms. Yun. You're a major celebrity — who in Liyue hasn't heard the name Yun Jin?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 gentrymaocai 03.ogg Gentry Maocai: Haha, in the circles I move in, anyone who says they've never seen Yun Jin on stage is at risk of getting laughed out of business! Hehehe...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: ...Gosh...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 gentrymaocai 04.ogg Gentry Maocai: As it happens, I have a business meeting at the Xinyue Kiosk with a client who is also a big fan of yours...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 gentrymaocai 05.ogg Gentry Maocai: So, ahem... I was wondering if you'd perhaps like to join us for the meal?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 maksim 04.ogg Maksim: Oh, uh... Me too! I've booked a table at the Liuli Pavilion and was hoping you might join me!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: ...Oh, I'm terribly sorry to both of you, but I won't be able to make it.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: I'm very grateful for the invitations, but I'm afraid I already have arrangements for this evening.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: Right, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 Yep, here I am.
 Sorry I'm a little late.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 gentrymaocai 06.ogg Gentry Maocai: Uh... O—Okay, you have plans, but, uh... You're really gonna pass this up? I mean, you could always reschedule...?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 gentrymaocai 07.ogg Gentry Maocai: Wait a second, you're—
 Am I really so famous in Liyue?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 gentrymaocai 08.ogg Gentry Maocai: Tsk, well, I guess it's not going to work out today, then. Maybe another day, Ms. Yun!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 maksim 05.ogg Maksim: (Huh... He took off pretty quick. Does he know something I don't?)[Note 1]
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 maksim 06.ogg Maksim: ...Haha, I guess I'll be leaving too. Wouldn't want to cramp your style!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 yunjin 08.ogg Yun Jin: Take care, both of you. Sorry that I can't see you off.
Gentry Maocai and Maksim leave in a hurry...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 yunjin 09.ogg Yun Jin: Phew... Thanks for coming to my rescue, again.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 yunjin 10.ogg Yun Jin: Look at you, you're a national treasure. Even Gentry Maocai is in awe of you.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 yunjin 11.ogg Yun Jin: I feel a little sorry for Xinyue Kiosk and Liuli Pavilion... I just hope the food won't go to waste.
 Well, why don't we go to Xinyue Kiosk?
 Well, why don't we go to Liuli Pavilion?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 yunjin 12.ogg Yun Jin: I don't think we'd be able to get a seat this late.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 yunjin 13.ogg Yun Jin: But it's fine. I have a better place we can go.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903701 yunjin 14.ogg Yun Jin: Let's head downstairs. I owe you a big thank-you tonight.

Guests from The Steambird[]

(Go to the bottom floor of Heyu Tea House)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 shiyun 01.ogg Shiyun: M—Ms. Yun? Oh, wow, it's really you! I—I have just a few questions, if you don't mind!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 01.ogg Boyi: Hey, get back here! Ugh! Ditzy girl, you don't have a clue what you're doing...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Are you a journalist? If you'd like to arrange an interview, you'll have to liaise with my manager...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 02.ogg Boyi: Sorry, Ms. Yun, don't mind her — she's just new and still learning the ropes. We'll leave you alone—
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 shiyun 02.ogg Shiyun: Ms. Yun, I'm interested to know why you added a silk dance to the scene where the divine damsel makes her appearance?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: ...Hmm?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: ...Y—You noticed that?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 shiyun 03.ogg Shiyun: Yes. Based on the original script, that scene would see your character perform the adeptus walk... but the addition of the silk dance meant that the whole way you carried yourself was so much more... so much more...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: ...Animated?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 shiyun 04.ogg Shiyun: Yes, yes! But delicate and graceful, like a crane!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: Oh? Sorry, which publication are you from? How come I haven't met you before?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 shiyun 05.ogg Shiyun: Oh, uh, I... well...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 03.ogg Boyi: Ahaha, we're from The Steambird. I'm Boyi, the editor-in-chief, and this young lady is Shiyun, one of my journalists.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 04.ogg Boyi: We were based in Fontaine, just recently, we made the move back to Liyue.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: Oh, I see! You're from The Steambird.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: Then it's no wonder. Your journalist has clearly done her research.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 shiyun 06.ogg Shiyun: Th—That's very kind of you, but really, my level of knowledge is very basic compared to yours...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 05.ogg Boyi: Hey! Ms. Yun's throwing you a bone here — make the most of it, okay? Talk to her, talk to her!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 08.ogg Yun Jin: Actually, I'm afraid there's somewhere I need to be, and I'd really need to clear this interview with my manager...
 Make the most of it. You may as well talk to them.
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 Let's play it safe and book the interview in with your manager.
(Proceed to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 Make the most of it. You may as well talk to them.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 09.ogg Yun Jin: But what about our plans...
 Let's take a rain check on that.
 I'm interested to hear your story, too.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 10.ogg Yun Jin: Really? Okay, sure...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 shiyun 07.ogg Shiyun: Oh, thank you! Thank you so much, Ms. Yun!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 06.ogg Boyi: Great! Thank you both kindly. Let's find a quiet place and get this interview underway!
Yun Jin and Shiyun get along quite well...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 shiyun 08.ogg Shiyun: ...I see, so that's why you added the silk dance in this scene.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 11.ogg Yun Jin: Yes, exactly. Doing it this way not only allows for more physicality in my movement, it also means I can make better use of the stage and transition into the scene more quickly.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 shiyun 09.ogg Shiyun: Ah, okay, so there was even more to it than I thought... So wouldn't it make sense to contrast this with the Dongtang, appassionato section that comes directly afterward by making the latter a little more sophisticated...?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 12.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm? I think I know which section you're talking about.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 shiyun 10.ogg Shiyun: Ah, sorry, sorry! What am I saying, this is a fixed formula isn't it? My suggestion would completely break the format...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 13.ogg Yun Jin: No, it's okay. It's an interesting idea, for sure.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 14.ogg Yun Jin: I'll give it some thought. Thanks for the suggestion!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 shiyun 11.ogg Shiyun: R—Really? Wow, I'm so honored!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 07.ogg Boyi: Humph...
 This conversation is way beyond me...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 08.ogg Boyi: Ahem! Uh, Shiyun, maybe it's time to move onto some of the things our readers would like to know about, hmm?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 shiyun 12.ogg Shiyun: Oh... Okay, um, I was also going to ask for your opinion on the set and the costumes...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 09.ogg Boyi: Ahem! Ahem! Yes, well... I'm sure Ms. Yun has countless pearls of wisdom she could share on her chosen craft, hehehe...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 10.ogg Boyi: But, uh, not all of our readers are quite so, ahem, artistically literate, shall we say...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 11.ogg Boyi: Hehe, a lot of them really just want to know more about you. You know, what does Yun Jin do when she's offstage, hmm?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 15.ogg Yun Jin: ...Excuse me? When I'm offstage?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 12.ogg Boyi: Yeah, you know... You're a major celebrity, and a lot of our readers are interested to know what life is like for you — what kind of place you live in, what kind of things you eat, clothes you wear, things you buy, that whole side of things. A day in the life.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 16.ogg Yun Jin: ...Um, besides rehearsing, a day in my life isn't really any more interesting than anyone else's.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 13.ogg Boyi: Nonsense, of course it is! Just think how many people were at your show earlier — they come from all over just to show their support.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 14.ogg Boyi: In fact, a relative of mine has a daughter who's been saying she wants to broaden her horizons recently. She's been looking for a chance to give you a jade hairpin as a gift!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 17.ogg Yun Jin: ...Heh.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 18.ogg Yun Jin: It's against the rules of the opera troupe to accept private gifts from patrons.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 19.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm... Could someone out there be accepting gifts for the troupe under false pretenses? I must get Yunning to look into it...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 15.ogg Boyi: Uh... I mean, it wasn't a big deal, just something she said. Forget I brought it up.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 16.ogg Boyi: So, I saw Gentry Maocai and a Snezhnayan gentleman come down from upstairs. Are they patrons of your shows, too?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 17.ogg Boyi: What are your thoughts on Snezhnaya and the Fatui...?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 20.ogg Yun Jin: ...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 shiyun 13.ogg Shiyun: Aaaah! I'm sorry, this is my first interview, and my notes are becoming a total mess!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 shiyun 14.ogg Shiyun: I might need a moment to pause and reorganize them a little, otherwise I'll never be able to work all this into an article... Mr. Boyi, maybe you should take a look, too!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 18.ogg Boyi: Don't be ridiculous! Stopping an interview halfway through to organize your notes, what are you talking about? Hey, hey, alright, alright... Ms. Yun, we'll just be a moment!
The journalist leaves with the Editor-in-Chief...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 21.ogg Yun Jin: *sigh*...
 You look tired.
 Are you sure you want to continue?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 22.ogg Yun Jin: I'm fine... It's not the first time I've been asked questions like these. The last time it happened, Yunning stopped the interview for me...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 23.ogg Yun Jin: But the next day, the tabloids were full of articles like "Dramatic Exit: Yun Jin Storms Out of Interview" and "Miss La-Dee-Da Opera Star Is Too Good For Our Questions"...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 24.ogg Yun Jin: ...Yeah, so from then on, Yunning said all interview requests have to go through her.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 25.ogg Yun Jin: I used to think I could hold the troupe together just by putting on a good performance. But now, I have to make sure I concentrate on my actions offstage, too. *sigh*...
 I saw a lot of the audience on the way over here...
 Many of them found your performance very moving.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 26.ogg Yun Jin: Oh... You mean Fan Er'ye and that crowd? I cherish them as members of my audience, too.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 27.ogg Yun Jin: But there aren't many people like them, who can appreciate all the nuance in a single viewing.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 28.ogg Yun Jin: How did Shiyun end up working with an editor like that guy? Something feels wrong there.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 29.ogg Yun Jin: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), they could be back at any moment. I should stay here for now — but could you go look into it for me?
 No problem.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 30.ogg Yun Jin: If you find out anything, come straight back here and let me know.
(Talk to Yun Jin again)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903756 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: They must have left the tea house by now. Let me know if you find anything out.
(Proceed to Backstage Suspicions)

Branch 2[]

 Let's play it safe and book the interview in with your manager.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 31.ogg Yun Jin: Yes... you're right.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 32.ogg Yun Jin: I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid the troupe is pretty strict about the rules for this kind of thing, so we'll have to do this by the book. Please liaise with my manager and we can do this interview another day.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 33.ogg Yun Jin: The Steambird is a highly reputable publication, so I'm sure my manager won't give you a hard time. Once the interview is arranged, I'll be very happy to answer any and all questions you have.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 boyi 19.ogg Boyi: But... *sigh* Fair enough. Sorry if we were being intrusive, please forgive us. We'll leave you in peace... Hey, c'mon! Quit dawdling!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 shiyun 15.ogg Shiyun: Yes... I'm coming! Bye, Ms. Yun...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 34.ogg Yun Jin: Hey, wait... that's the wrong way if you wanted to talk to my manager...
 They're gone...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 35.ogg Yun Jin: Oh well... Never mind.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 36.ogg Yun Jin: I have a friend who works for a paper. I'll ask them later.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 37.ogg Yun Jin: For now, though, the top priority is making good on our plans.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 38.ogg Yun Jin: Now I think about it... I've turned down three social engagements tonight.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903702 yunjin 39.ogg Yun Jin: Come with me. Our plan is the only one remaining, so let's make the most of it.

A Merchant Most Famous[]

(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Dori, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19074 dori 01.ogg Dori: (The most benevolent Lord Sangemah Bay makes your dreams come true.)
(Talk to Dori)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907401 dori 01.ogg Dori: Oh, where did all that passion go from earlier, hmm? I take it you weren't able to find a sponsor for your project?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907401 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Please don't tell me that you're here to mock us.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907401 dori 02.ogg Dori: Hmph, what kind of person do you take me for? Would the kind and generous Lord Sangemah Bay really do such a thing? I will say though, I more or less expected this outcome even before I introduced them to you.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907401 dori 03.ogg Dori: You can try to talk up the project all you want, but the facts will remain the same. This project is high-investment with slow-returns. No sane person would put their money into this.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907401 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: But this isn't just a business project, right?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907401 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: Also, if you already knew no one would want to partner with us, why did you still try to charge me five hundred thousand Mora? You scammer!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907401 dori 04.ogg Dori: Ahem. You might want to remember who your creditor is before you start talking like that, Kaveh.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907401 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: I'll pay back every last coin that I still owe you, but that's a completely different matter.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907401 dori 05.ogg Dori: Alright, since you're so devastated about this, I'll set you up for dinner with another big name merchant.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907401 dori 06.ogg Dori: In fact, I'll be inviting the most famous merchant in all of Sumeru, so I'll be counting on your performance!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907401 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: What? Really?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907401 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: I... I would like to sincerely apologize for my attitude just now.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907401 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: So, where would we be meeting this merchant?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907401 dori 07.ogg Dori: Follow me! Oh, I suppose both of you can come.
(After following Dori)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 dori 01.ogg Dori: This is the place.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: You said you're going to introduce us to the most famous merchant in Sumeru... Well, where are they?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 dori 02.ogg Dori: You still don't get it, huh? The most famous merchant in Sumeru—
 Is Lord Sangemah Bay?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Huh!? So you meant yourself all along? Then why did you bring us here?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 dori 03.ogg Dori: Well, I've given it some thought, and that complex of education and culture buildings that you mentioned does hold some promise.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 dori 04.ogg Dori: It will be a pretty big Mora sink, and I'll have to fund it all on my own, but that's not really a problem for me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: Seriously?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Where's this generosity coming from so suddenly? Are you trying to scam me again?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 dori 05.ogg Dori: The reasons are not important. What's important is that I'm willing to help you.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 dori 06.ogg Dori: However, you know just as well as me that once this project actually breaks ground, it'll start sucking Mora from my pockets like crazy. So to cut costs... hmm...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: I get it, I get it. I won't charge any commission fees, and I'll take responsibility for the entire project.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 dori 07.ogg Dori: Splendid! Then let's sign the contract right away.
Dori prepares two contracts. After a brief read, Kaveh signs them at record speed.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Phew... This way, the children of the desert will have some books to read. Their lives should improve a bit after this.
 You seem rather pleased.
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Of course. There are few things better than using my knowledge to help other people change their fates.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: I must thank you as well, Dori. I used to say you only cared about Mora, which might have been some prejudice on my part. Sorry for that. I will also try to pay back my debts as soon as possible.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: Now, let's have a quick discussion. Where would you want the library to be built? That will be the most important building.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 dori 08.ogg Dori: Hehe, there's no rush! I'll provide you with a copy of the deed when we get back. You can just use the address on the document to find the lot.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: Huh... the deed?
 You don't mean...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: So hold on a sec... The person who has been buying up everything around Aaru Village was you all along!?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 dori 09.ogg Dori: Oh my, did I not tell you about that? Yep, yours truly has been buying up all the land. I must thank you for bringing your ideas to me — before our conversation, I had no idea what to build on all those lots!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 dori 10.ogg Dori: So from my perspective, this has been a great turn of events. I didn't put much in, and easily got a lot in return.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: But what about my commission fees!?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 dori 11.ogg Dori: Huh, didn't you waive those yourself? I was just going to say that to cut costs, we mustn't procrastinate and should start construction as soon as possible.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 dori 12.ogg Dori: But before I could finish my sentence, you volunteered to waive your commission fees, and even promised to take responsibility for the whole project from start to finish. I am so touched, really!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: It's obvious that you used every trick in the book to deceive me... You deliberately paused for a long time while talking about the project, and kept glancing at me with that menacing look in your eyes!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 dori 13.ogg Dori: Huh, you really think so? Well, the contract's already been signed, so there's no point in dwelling on the details. You know what? I'll pay for tonight's dinner.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: ...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: Fine, I'll drop the argument on the commission fees. But since you said you're paying for dinner...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907402 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: I'm going to order the best dishes and booze this place has to offer, and lots of it. Tonight, we're feasting until I've recouped my full commission fees!

Nothing Going Bump After All...[]

(Talk to Chongyun)
(If coming from Ever Deeper)

Media:vo cycop001 1903110 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: You're back! How did it go? Did you see an evil spirit...?
 No, I only saw an event staff member pretending to be a ghost.
Media:vo cycop001 1903110 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: Huh...? So that's what's going on here!?
Media:vo cycop001 1903110 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: No evil spirits...? No danger...? It's all just a setup...?
 It's just for entertainment, you took it way too seriously.
 I'm sorry, but that seems to be the truth.
 That's all there is to the Test of Courage.
(If coming from Sudden Discomfort)

Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: Thanks for finding these ingredients for me. I feel much better now.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: Although I still feel the yang energy stirring, at least I won't need to worry about it getting out of control.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: So, did you find any new leads when you were out looking for ingredients?
 No, I only saw an event staff member pretending to be a ghost.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: Huh...? So that's what's going on here!?
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: Does that mean that all the strange things here are just a hoax?
 It's just for entertainment, you took it way too seriously.
 I'm sorry, but that seems to be the truth.
 That's all there is to the Test of Courage.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: I—I see... So I was wrong again.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: *sigh* In that case, I suppose there's no reason for us to linger here any longer.
 Remember that strange mist we found earlier? I would like to investigate that further.
(Go to Branch 1)
 Right, let's head back.
(Go to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 Remember that strange mist we found earlier? I would like to investigate that further.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 12.ogg Chongyun: Yes, that was proof of an evil spirit's presence, but we can't be sure that the spirits still exist.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 13.ogg Chongyun: Actually, I would also like to investigate that further...
 We've already come all this way, let's have a look.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 14.ogg Chongyun: You're right. I'll focus my mind and spirit.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 15.ogg Chongyun: Perhaps it'd be more effective for us to split up.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 16.ogg Chongyun: Evil spirits will keep their distance if they sense the power of my pure-yang spirit.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 17.ogg Chongyun: So you'll be more likely to find one if you're on your own.
 And then I'll wait for you to come and defeat it?
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 18.ogg Chongyun: Yes, that would be best. Just keep it distracted till I arrive.
 I might defeat the spirit by the time you arrive.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 19.ogg Chongyun: Another means to the same end. Don't worry about me, purging it is the priority.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 20.ogg Chongyun: I'll take this side, you take the other side. Let's move.
(Continues to Independent Actions)

Branch 2[]

 Right, let's head back.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: I'm sorry, this has all been a waste of your precious time...
 Don't take it to heart.
 Maybe we could hang out together sometime.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: Hehe, you are very kind.
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: At least we checked the Test of Courage together and verified that the place is clear of danger...
Media:vo cycop001 1903202 chongyun 11.ogg Chongyun: *sigh* But if only we had found some evil spirits, then it all would have been worthwhile...

(Talk to Beatrice with Mondstadt Grilled Fish in inventory)
Media:vo noecop001 1906801 beatrice 01.ogg Beatrice: *sigh* How am I ever going to get Quinn to listen to me...?
(Give  Suspicious Mondstadt Grilled Fish)
Media:vo noecop001 1906801 beatrice 02.ogg Beatrice: What's... what's this? Not an attractive sight...
Media:vo noecop001 1906801 beatrice 03.ogg Beatrice: Smells a little strange, too... Surely this can't be what you want me give to Quinn?
 O—Of course not...
Media:vo noecop001 1906801 beatrice 04.ogg Beatrice: I'll keep waiting for you here then.
(Give  Mondstadt Grilled Fish)
Media:vo noecop001 1906801 beatrice 05.ogg Beatrice: Uh... Mondstadt Grilled Fish... for Quinn?
Media:vo noecop001 1906801 beatrice 06.ogg Beatrice: I have often said that I would bring him lunch... Would this really work? Hmm...
Media:vo noecop001 1906801 beatrice 07.ogg Beatrice: Well, since it's Noelle's recommendation, I'll give it a try!
Media:vo noecop001 1906801 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: I hope Quinn understands Bea's intentions...
Media:vo noecop001 1906801 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: And I hope we were a help this time...
 But now's not the best time to disturb them...
 Now then, let's take that break...
Media:vo noecop001 1906801 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Mm... apologies, by the way. I said we would take a break and ended up bothering you.
Media:vo noecop001 1906801 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Oh! If you're peckish, just let me know. I can whip something up for you right away!
 No whipping anything up...
 You're taking a break, remember?
Media:vo noecop001 1906801 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Argh, sorry. Old habits die hard...
You enjoy a relaxing time with Noelle...
(After the cutscene)
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: You know... I—I'm still a little worried about how Bea is doing...
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: There's no stopping you once you're concerned about someone, huh! Come on then, let's see how she's doing!

(Talk to Quinn, optional)
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 quinn 01.ogg Quinn: Fruit, fresh fruit... want some fruit?
 Bea's gift...? Uhh...
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 quinn 02.ogg Quinn: Oh... she said something about giving me something to eat... but I'm really not hungry right now...
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 quinn 03.ogg Quinn: Besides, she's constantly talking about bringing me lunch, so I didn't think anything of it this time...
(Talk to Beatrice)
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 beatrice 01.ogg Beatrice: Ugh...
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Bea?
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 beatrice 02.ogg Beatrice: Oh... hi Noelle...
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: So... Ahem! Did you get a d—date with Quinn?
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 beatrice 03.ogg Beatrice: *sigh* I barely want to talk about it...
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 beatrice 04.ogg Beatrice: I hadn't even given him the Mondstadt Grilled Fish when he muttered something about not having an appetite and not wanting to eat.
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 beatrice 05.ogg Beatrice: I can't force him to eat, can I...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 beatrice 06.ogg Beatrice: Looks like I'll just have to try to ask him out some other time.
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: I... I must apologize.
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Next time, I'll help you find a much better gift!
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 beatrice 07.ogg Beatrice: No need... It should be me apologizing. I was worried and dumped everything on you.
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 beatrice 08.ogg Beatrice: It's obvious, thinking about it now... Noelle can't be good at everything...
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Oh...
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 beatrice 09.ogg Beatrice: It's okay. This isn't your fault, I don't blame you. I... I have to get going.
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Please... Take care...
 ...Noelle...
 ...Everything okay?
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: I'm... I'm fine...
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: It's just... I feel bad that I couldn't help Bea...
 It's impossible to be an expert on everything, you know...
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: You're not wrong... but if I give up so easily, then the next time someone needs help, I'll mess up again...
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: I may not know much about this sort of thing, but at the very least I should try to learn something about it...
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: I... I'm going to the Knights of Favonius library! There must be some guidance there on the subject of love!
Media:vo noecop001 1906802 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: The next time I encounter a situation like this, I'll be able to help...
(After the cutscene)
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Can Noelle really handle a subject as big as love by herself?
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We should head to the library and see how she's doing.

The Almighty Maid and Her Impossible Task[]

(Approach Noelle)
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: "...since you've already noticed, I guess I can let you lend a hand."
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: ...Ah, so that's how it works. When you meet the person who inspires your affections, you have to find a way to do things together with them...
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Hmm. "...even if not old enough to drink, one should still learn to discuss the different qualities of wine..."
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: ...I see, so you need to know how to make yourself interesting, to draw people's attention
 What are you reading?
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Ah! S—Sorry! I didn't see you there! I was deep in concentration...
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: I borrowed every book on love from the library that I could find.
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: When I've finished reading them, I'll finally be able to give decisive recommendations for next time! ...Even if it is me.
 ...So, what books do we have here?
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Well, let's see... For example, "Vera's Melancholy," "Heart of Clear Springs"...
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: ...All of them contain detailed records of the experience of love! As a maid, my experience leaves a lot to be desired, so I found the quickest way was to take examples from the classics!
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: There's also "A Guide to Tavern Chat," and "Shortcuts to Love"...
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: ...These are much more practical in nature! And of course, there are even books that focus on theories of love!
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: And there's this one, this book's about... Mmm... hmm...hmm?
 About what?
 Can I take a look?
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: N—No! ...Nothing! This book... it's too early to read this book...
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: L—Let's look at another one...You have to learn the basics first, after all...
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: Uh, so this book is about... huh? S—Same as that one...? Guess this must be a pretty... common topic...
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: *sigh* Looks like I... still have a lot to learn...

(Talk to Noelle again)
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: Whew! All these b—books have got my heart racing...
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: I think I should take a break and do something else... to distract myself...
Media:vo noecop001 1906803 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: Then again, perhaps I should finish this one first. Just the one, right?
(Read Noelle's Study Notes)
Noelle's Study Notes: "Make time to be together alone," "Give (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) a cake you made yourself"...
Noelle's Study Notes: Words of counsel and wisdom are penned here in a lovely hand that unfortunately grew shaky towards the tail end.
Noelle's Study Notes: Some of the text has been arbitrarily struck out, seemingly a result of the owner's emotions suddenly running high.

Media:vo noecop001 1906901 beatrice 01.ogg Beatrice: *sigh* How am I ever going to get Quinn to listen to me...?

(Talk to Marjorie)

Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 02.ogg Marjorie: And what wind brought the two of you together? I barely ever see Noelle in someone else's company.
 Barely ever?
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 03.ogg Marjorie: Well, when Noelle's working, she practically always takes care of things by herself.
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 04.ogg Marjorie: And once she's finished with A, it's straight off to take care of B. Seems she hardly has time to catch her breath.
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 05.ogg Marjorie: Say, Noelle... you're not a child anymore, you know?
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 06.ogg Marjorie: If you don't take time out for yourself, you may come to regret it in the future...
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: I, um... decided to take a break today...
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: But something came up...
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 07.ogg Marjorie: Oh? So it's a day off... with the Honorary Knight?
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 08.ogg Marjorie: Ooooh! How wonderful! That's something to celebrate!
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 09.ogg Marjorie: You must be here to pick out a gift for the Honorary Knight? Choose anything you like. We have a lot that might tickle your fancy!
 Even without gifts, today is still a day to be celebrated.
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 10.ogg Marjorie: Wow! So this must be... an anniversary? How many years? Come on, give me the details...
 Actually, we're here to help someone else choose a gift.
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 11.ogg Marjorie: Aww, so shy! No use denying it though.
 Actually, I'm here to buy a gift for Noelle.
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 12.ogg Marjorie: Oh! Well, it doesn't matter who's sending what to who... You can't get without giving!
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Stop teasing!
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Me and the Honorary Knight don't have that kind of relationship...
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 13.ogg Marjorie: Hehehe... not yet!
 Seems you have a knack for this kind of thing, Marjorie...
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 14.ogg Marjorie: Eh! I guess... After all, Noelle here is the type that needs a push every now and again.
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 15.ogg Marjorie: But looks like she's still in the dark when it comes to these things.
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: I... I just feel... I shouldn't let such things distract me from my Chivalric Training!
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Yes... there are too many important things to take care of...
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 16.ogg Marjorie: Okay, okay, no more teasing. So, what is the reason for this visit?
 It's like this...
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 17.ogg Marjorie: So... you're choosing a gift for Bea to give to Quinn...
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 18.ogg Marjorie: In that case, I have a couple of fun new things in stock: a Frostening Bottle and a Squirrel Wood Carving.
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 19.ogg Marjorie: The Frostening Bottle is very useful to keep alcohol cold and fresh for a long time.
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 20.ogg Marjorie: As for the Squirrel Wood Carving... Well, it's a nice ornament, and it would look great at Quinn's stall.
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 21.ogg Marjorie: So, bottle or ornament... which will it be?
 The Frostening Bottle...
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: A Frostening Bottle... a fitting gift for one of the Four Drunkards.
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: (They remembered what I said... Aww...)
 The Squirrel Wood Carving...
(−1 Heart)
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Hmmm... I'm a little worried that Quinn might just throw a wood carving in a drawer and forget about it...
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: To be on the safe side, how about we give him the Frostening Bottle?
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: As one of the Four Drunkards, he's sure to love it!
Media:vo noecop001 1906901 marjorie 22.ogg Marjorie: So, Frostening Bottle it is? Alrighty, let me wrap it up for you.
(Obtain  Handpicked Gift)
(After the cutscene)
Media:vo noecop001 1906902 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Okay, now that the gift is wrapped...

(Talk to Beatrice)
Media:vo noecop001 1906902 beatrice 01.ogg Beatrice: Hmmm? Give the Frostening Bottle to Quinn?
Media:vo noecop001 1906902 beatrice 02.ogg Beatrice: It does look like something that he's be interested in.
Media:vo noecop001 1906902 beatrice 03.ogg Beatrice: Wait, wait... maybe... I can use the gift as bait... I could say that if he wants to get the gift then he'll have to come on a date with me first...
Media:vo noecop001 1906902 beatrice 04.ogg Beatrice: Thank you both so much! With this gift, there's no way Quinn will be able to refuse me!

Media:vo noecop001 1906902 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Well, as long as it helps!
Media:vo noecop001 1906902 beatrice 05.ogg Beatrice: Ah! Oh no!
Media:vo noecop001 1906902 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: What's wrong?
Media:vo noecop001 1906902 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: The gift? Is there something wrong with the gift?
Media:vo noecop001 1906902 beatrice 06.ogg Beatrice: No, no, it's not the gift...
Media:vo noecop001 1906902 beatrice 07.ogg Beatrice: I've been so focused on convincing Quinn, I haven't even thought about where our date's gonna be!
 No... really?
Media:vo noecop001 1906902 beatrice 08.ogg Beatrice: I've never gotten to that stage!
Media:vo noecop001 1906902 beatrice 09.ogg Beatrice: Noelle... could you help me...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906902 beatrice 10.ogg Beatrice: *sigh* A date should be properly planned, so I'll wait. No need to rush!
Media:vo noecop001 1906902 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Just... leave it to me.
(After the cutscene)
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: A date... Hmm, we'll need a place with pleasant scenery and a quiet atmosphere...
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Let's look around. If we see anywhere good, let's take a picture and let Bea have the final say.
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Oh! There's a beautiful and touching tale about Cape Oath. Maybe that would be a good spot?

(Go to Cape Oath)

Media:vo noecop001 1906903 beatrice 07.ogg Beatrice: Cape Oath... as in maybe taking a relationship oath? Sounds great!
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 beatrice 08.ogg Beatrice: You can see the sea from there, right? I love the sea.
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: Well, what do you think about Windrise?
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: May your love be as free as a dandelion...
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 beatrice 09.ogg Beatrice: Windrise? Hmm, that's a great location... but isn't it a bit cliché?
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: Huh? C—Cliché?
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 beatrice 10.ogg Beatrice: Well, old folks are always going on about something symbolic about that place... Besides, we've been there so many times when we were young.
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 beatrice 11.ogg Beatrice: It just feels like there's nothing special or new about it...
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: Oh... okay...
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 beatrice 12.ogg Beatrice: Hmmm... I'm going with Cape Oath! Thanks so much. I'm off to find Quinn.
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 beatrice 13.ogg Beatrice: Ahhhh, Quinn... I wonder what kind of oath he'll make to me...
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: Uhh...
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 noelle 20.ogg Noelle: Is Windrise... no longer popular...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 noelle 21.ogg Noelle: But... the book said it was the most popular place in Mondstadt...
 When was the book written?
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 noelle 22.ogg Noelle: Uh... I'm not sure, I found it while cleaning a corner if the library...
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 noelle 23.ogg Noelle: It was the story of Windrise and Lady Vennessa...
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 noelle 24.ogg Noelle: I thought folks in Mondstadt would still like to go there...
 Don't worry about it. I like it.
 Would you like to go there with me?
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 noelle 25.ogg Noelle: Huh? You want to go to Windrise?
 Think of it as our last break of the day.
Media:vo noecop001 1906903 noelle 26.ogg Noelle: O—Okay! Follow me!

Promised Place[]

(Talk to Beatrice and Quinn at Cape Oath)
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 beatrice 01.ogg Beatrice: ...Quinn! Look! That's Falcon Coast — right there!
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 quinn 01.ogg Quinn: Wow, you really can see it... I've always thought it was far away... I had no idea how close it was.
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 beatrice 02.ogg Beatrice: Perhaps... there are other things around you that seem far away, but are actually very close...
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 quinn 02.ogg Quinn: You're right... So many potential customers out there...
(Approach Noelle)
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: *sigh* The air here really refreshes you in an instant.
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Forget about training and work, just breathe and feel the wind... Nothing else...
 You can come here whenever you like, you know.
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Ha, that's true.
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: But training and work are still the things I need to focus on.
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: If I didn't take them seriously, I wouldn't be a reliable maid.
 Isn't that tiring?
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Yes, to some degree. But, Lady Vennessa... and Master Jean... they worked much harder than me.
 So this is the responsibility that you put on yourself?
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Put it this way, Lady Vennessa... and Master Jean... the responsibilities they carry — that they carried — those are the heaviest.
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: I know I have a lot to live up to. That's why I want to become a real knight of Favonius — to help more people.
 You already possess the greatest qualities of a knight.
 Helping others is the greatest quality of a knight.
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: R—Really...? Thank you.
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: If you weren't here today, I wouldn't have been able to help Bea.
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: It's just a small token of appreciation, but I hope you'll accept it.
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Roses are my favorite flower. This is a paper one that I folded by hand.
 ...Do you know the meaning of a rose?
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: Of course! In Mondstadt, roses represent the saying, "As wine bottles are corked, so too my lips are sealed."
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: I have seen and learned a lot during our time together.
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: It will become a wonderful memory — one that I will savor again and again...
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: I want it to remain in my heart and become a secret between the two of us.
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: *sigh* ...Wait! Do you mean that... roses have some meaning that I don't know about?
 Uh... never mind.
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: Oh... I'll need to go back to the library and find out...
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: Still, whatever a rose means...
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 20.ogg Noelle: I hope that this one can stay by your side in all your future adventures!
Media:vo noecop001 1906904 noelle 21.ogg Noelle: Before I'm able to fight alongside you, Honorary Knight...

 Quest DescriptionThe Wisdom Seelie left a few hints in its letter. Perhaps you could first figure out what it's up to.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 01.ogg Layla: We should be close. This is the way I came when I first traveled to Sumeru City.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 02.ogg Layla: *sigh* It's been way too long since I last visited home...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 03.ogg Layla: No, no, this isn't the time for that kind of talk. We have to hurry and find the clues that the Seelie left behind.
 It's a pretty big area...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 04.ogg Layla: It is... Relying solely on what the Seelie said might not be viable.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 05.ogg Layla: Hmm, assuming the Seelie is intentionally linking the clues to my past, ah, I think I have an idea.
 Let's hear it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 06.ogg Layla: Um, so this is a little embarrassing. At that time, the sight of Sumeru City was absolutely mesmerizing. I was anxious, but also excited about all the things to come.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 07.ogg Layla: I was distracted and... accidentally stepped on an Avidya Leopard's tail.
 The price of being distracted...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 08.ogg Layla: I didn't notice it at all... The poor thing was sound asleep, and after I stepped on its tail, it bolted straight up. I freaked out and ran as fast as I could.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 09.ogg Layla: There were actually more Avidya Leopards sleeping nearby, and they were all faster than me... I almost got bitten a couple of times.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 10.ogg Layla: Good thing someone from the Eremites heard me shouting for help. They managed to scare off the leopards.
 Good thing you weren't hurt.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 11.ogg Layla: Yeah, but when I finally managed to calm myself down, I noticed that the talisman my mother had made for me was missing.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 12.ogg Layla: It's extremely precious to me. Ever since I was little, I would always carry it with me whenever I'm doing something important.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 13.ogg Layla: I also had it with me when the Akademiya conducted its selection exam at my village. I checked my bag at least a dozen times to make sure the talisman was in there.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 14.ogg Layla: I feel much more at ease knowing that I have it with me. I had thought that it would also help me calm my nerves in Sumeru City.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 15.ogg Layla: But I ended up losing it before I even finished registration at the Akademiya...
 I can sympathize with your feeling of loss.
 The peace of mind it gave you must be irreplaceable.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 16.ogg Layla: Yeah, and that's when I started having sleeping problems... I just began to sleep less and less each day.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 17.ogg Layla: Losing a talisman like that is definitely a bad omen...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 18.ogg Layla: Oh, sorry, I'm starting to ramble again. What were we talking about before...? Oh right, why the Seelie led us here.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 19.ogg Layla: I think we should look around where the Avidya Leopards attacked me.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 20.ogg Layla: If the Seelie is trying to make me remember things that happened in the past, it would make the most sense for it to hide clues in memorable locations.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 21.ogg Layla: Hope the Seelie's clue wasn't also torn to shreds by Avidya Leopards...
 Let's look around first.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 22.ogg Layla: Yeah... That's the only way we'll know for sure...
 Relax. No need to be so pessimistic all the time.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 23.ogg Layla: I'm sorry, you're right. It's a bad habit of mine.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915402 layla 24.ogg Layla: I suppose any progress is a step in the right direction. Let's go.
(Go to the place mentioned in the letter)
(Near the rock formation)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915403 layla 01.ogg Layla: We should be close...
(After destroying the rock formation)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915403 layla 02.ogg Layla: Sure enough, it's here, and in a really obvious place. That pretty much confirms my hunch about the Seelie's intentions.
 It seems like the Seelie knows you really well.
 It feels like the Seelie is trying to provoke you.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915403 layla 03.ogg Layla: I dunno... but how did it know about all these details? I've hardly told anyone about this stuff...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915403 layla 04.ogg Layla: It's not hiding somewhere and spying on me, is it? Oh, that's a scary thought...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915403 layla 05.ogg Layla: *sigh* Anyway, let's look at the clue we've found.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915403 layla 06.ogg Layla: "Seems like you haven't forgotten about your very first failure."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915403 layla 07.ogg Layla: See? It knows everything.
 This might be too much, even for the Wisdom Seelie.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915403 layla 08.ogg Layla: I have no idea what's going on... No wonder this Seelie is becoming legendary. Let's keep reading the clue.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915403 layla 09.ogg Layla: "I've placed the second clue where heaven meets water. The answer, seemingly amongst the stars, was ultimately washed to some unremarkable place downstream."
Media:vo lylcop001 1915403 layla 10.ogg Layla: Just as I thought, it's something to do with me again.
 You already got the meaning?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915403 layla 11.ogg Layla: If the first clue was any indication, then the location described in this clue should also be related to my life experiences.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915403 layla 12.ogg Layla: Most Rtawahist research is related to studying the stars. My own thesis work often requires me to go in the field and collect astrological data.
(Stress Value +1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915403 layla 13.ogg Layla: And... *sigh* Let's just say there's another devastating and unforgettable failure I had.
 Should we still keep following these clues...?
 Thinking about these things will only make things worse for you.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915403 layla 14.ogg Layla: But that can't be helped, right? We do many things not because we want to, but because we have to.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915403 layla 15.ogg Layla: Let's keep moving. It might be hard to believe, but being out and about is making me feel a lot better than usual.
(Continue to Underlying Meaning)

Underlying Meaning[]

(Go to the place mentioned in the letter)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 01.ogg Layla: We're here. Th—That's the spot.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 02.ogg Layla: That's where I performed my first field observation after enrolling at the Akademiya. I borrowed some equipment from the school and came here on a perfectly clear day.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 03.ogg Layla: Everything was ready to go, and I was positive that I'd be able to get some great data.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 04.ogg Layla: But the equipment was a little heavy, and I didn't notice that the ground was muddy and some spots were unstable.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 05.ogg Layla: After I finished setting up everything, part of the ground suddenly shifted, and my equipment started teetering over. I rushed over to grab hold of it, but I ended up tripping over another piece of equipment...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 06.ogg Layla: The next thing I knew, everything was covered with muddy water... me, and all my equipment.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 07.ogg Layla: You must be wondering how someone can be so clumsy...
 Oh, not really...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 08.ogg Layla: You wouldn't be wrong for thinking that... I don't sleep much, so I get light-headed pretty often.
 We're all prone to mistakes when we aren't well-rested.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 09.ogg Layla: Thank you for understanding. If I were the one complaining about not being well-rested, it would just sound like an excuse.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 10.ogg Layla: It's a vicious cycle... the less I sleep, the more mistakes I make. The more mistakes I make, the harder it is for me to sleep...
 So what happened afterwards? Were you injured?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 11.ogg Layla: I just got a minor fracture, so I had to rest at Bimarstan for a while.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 12.ogg Layla: To pay off the damages to the equipment, I took some part-time jobs. I just went to work whenever I couldn't sleep. It took me forever to pay off what I owed.
 Don't tell me, your insomnia got worse after that?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 13.ogg Layla: Bingo... *sigh* The pressure from my studies and debt was crushing me, and I didn't want to tell my family about any of it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 14.ogg Layla: After all, I am the legendary Layla who made it into the Akademiya at a young age and had never failed an assignment in her life...
 Ever consider taking a break?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 15.ogg Layla: Of course. I've even considered giving up on my studies completely and returning home to help care for the Sumpter Beasts, but that would be kind of embarrassing...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 16.ogg Layla: I don't mean that I'd be embarrassed in front of others... I mean that I'd be ashamed of myself. After all, everything I've done up till now is only a result of my own decisions.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 17.ogg Layla: Although it hasn't always been smooth sailing and sometimes things don't go my way, I made it this far on my own. There haven't been any major incidents with my studies, and I even managed to pay off the equipment damages...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 18.ogg Layla: Ahh, but I guess I'm exaggerating a bit... Most of it is still due to the help of some unknown person, rather than my own work... hehe...
 Your parents would feel bad if they knew what you were going through.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 19.ogg Layla: And that's exactly why they mustn't ever find out. Once I've finally managed to acclimate to life in Sumeru City, I'll show them my success... I hope that day will come, eventually.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 20.ogg Layla: Anyways, let's continue looking for the next clue. It should be around here somewhere... an "unremarkable place downstream" was the description.
(Go to the place mentioned in the letter)
(Near the rock formation)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915404 layla 21.ogg Layla: Hmm, that "place downstream" could be somewhere close by.
(After destroying the rock formation)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915405 layla 01.ogg Layla: Here, it's over here! Whew, good thing it's dry. I was worried the message might be wet.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915405 layla 02.ogg Layla: Let's see... "Have you found it? The unremarkable place downstream?"
Media:vo lylcop001 1915405 layla 03.ogg Layla: Well... of course. How else could I be reading this message...? Seriously.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915405 layla 04.ogg Layla: "I've placed the third hint at a crossroad without a cross. You can turn left or right, but turning back shouldn't be an option."
 It feels like the clues are getting more and more vague...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915405 layla 05.ogg Layla: Hmm... they're actually getting clearer for me. I was sorta expecting this, even before I read the message.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915405 layla 06.ogg Layla: I dunno if the clues are following a timeline or if they're based on the amount of regret I have... Either way, this incident was bound to come up sooner or later.
 Sounds like this is getting personal.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915405 layla 07.ogg Layla: Hmm... would someone really go to all this trouble just to pull off some prank? I can't make heads or tails of it.
 Is the Seelie stalking you?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915405 layla 08.ogg Layla: A—Ahh... Don't say that... That sounds horrible.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915405 layla 09.ogg Layla: Anyway, just follow me. I'll save the story for when we get there.
(Continue to The Road to Failure)

The Road to Failure[]

(Look for the clues the Wisdom Seelie left behind)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 01.ogg Layla: This is the place that immediately came to mind when the hint mentioned a crossroad.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 02.ogg Layla: I came here to conduct some astrological observation once. Everything went smoothly on the way, and I thought I was starting to get used to life at the Akademiya.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 03.ogg Layla: But just as I was about to set up the observation equipment, I heard a strange sound coming from nearby. I made my way here and discovered a bunch of bandits robbing someone.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 04.ogg Layla: They were a group of Treasure Hoarders, and the family that was being mugged looked completely helpless. They definitely wouldn't have been able to escape, and simply handing over their Mora might not have been enough to make the bandits go away.
 So you wanted to help, but couldn't?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 05.ogg Layla: Not exactly. I already had a Vision by that time.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 06.ogg Layla: Someone with a Vision should technically be really powerful, right? Handling a group of Treasure Hoarders should be well within my abilities.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 07.ogg Layla: However, I didn't know how to channel the power of the elements to fight at that time, and I was super scared. *sigh* I wielded immense power, but I didn't feel any stronger than just an ordinary person.
 Then what happened?
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 08.ogg Layla: Then... I ran away. I scrambled towards Sumeru City looking for help.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 09.ogg Layla: Eventually, I managed to return with a few adventurers I ran into along the way.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 10.ogg Layla: It took longer than I had hoped, and by the time we made it back here, the Treasure Hoarders and the family were gone...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 11.ogg Layla: I don't know if the family only lost their belongings in the end, or if something worse happened to them.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 12.ogg Layla: I've faced a lot of problems after coming to Sumeru City, but this incident is one that I regret the most. I sat on the ground and began to cry.
(Stress Value +1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 13.ogg Layla: I could've stepped in to help that family... "Would it have ended differently... if I were just a little braver?"
 You did the right thing.
 You can't solve every problem with just courage alone. Being rational is just as important.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 14.ogg Layla: Thank you for trying to comfort me, but I can't stop myself from thinking that way.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 15.ogg Layla: It's just as the Seelie said, "Turning back shouldn't be an option." However, I can't help but think about running away whenever I'm faced with a challenge.
 The Seelie probably wants to do more than just criticize you for the past. Why don't you try facing your challenge head-on? (This dialogue option leads to One Final Step.)
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 16.ogg Layla: You're right. The more challenging it gets, the harder I should try.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 17.ogg Layla: Hmm... I'm feeling calmer now... Okay, let's go look for more leads nearby.
(Proceed to One Final Step)
 Let's take a break from searching and rest for a bit. (This dialogue option leads to An Exasperating Prank.)
 Let's take a break from searching and rest for a bit.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 18.ogg Layla: B—But what about my thesis? We still haven't found the Seelie's answer yet...
 Forget about the thesis, you need to get some rest first.
 Your health is more important than your thesis.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 19.ogg Layla: *sigh* Sorry for causing you so much trouble...
 Let's find someplace to rest.
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 20.ogg Layla: Alright. I... actually don't have much stamina. I've been stressed this whole time, and I feel exhausted...
Media:vo lylcop001 1915406 layla 21.ogg Layla: I'm really sorry.
(Proceed to An Exasperating Prank)

A Special Guest[]

Media:vo bdcop001 1905001 seadrake 01.ogg Sea Drake: Well, would you look who's here! Looks like it's going to be a day to remember. Guys, look who the sea washed up!
Media:vo_bdcop001 1905001 furong 01.ogg Furong: Ahoy there, Traveler. Hah, so Captain really did invite you to join the homecoming celebration!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_huixing_01.ogg Huixing: Hey! I heard that you took care of another crisis while you were in Inazuma. Are the rumors true?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_furong_02.ogg Furong: That's what I heard, too. Thanks to you, Inazuma's Vision Hunt Decree was finally put to an end... Well done, Traveler!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_seadrake_02.ogg Sea Drake: Captain's got quite the eye for people. She said she was sure that your trip to Inazuma would stir up some waves, and sure enough...
 All I wanted was to have a chat with the Electro Archon.
 It was a joint effort, I can't take all the credit.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_furong_03.ogg Furong: Heh, look at you, being so modest. We all know what you did to protect Liyue Harbor...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_seadrake_03.ogg Sea Drake: I've heard that they tell stories about you in Mondstadt too: the "Honorary Knight"... Pretty impressive!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_huixing_02.ogg Huixing: I'd say someone of your caliber would be right at home in The Crux. Right, sailors?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_furong_04.ogg Furong: Haha, that's right! Wow, I'm getting excited just thinking of being the Traveler's crewmate!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_furong_05.ogg Furong: Hey, whaddya say we arm wrestle?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), I was worried you'd be too busy to show up.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_seadrake_04.ogg Sea Drake: Oh, Captain on deck!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_huixing_03.ogg Huixing: Captain! We were just trying to talk the Traveler into joining the crew.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_furong_06.ogg Furong: Yeah c'mon, Captain Beidou! Surely you've got a way to get the Traveler onboard.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_beidou_02a.ogg Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_beidou_02b.ogg Beidou: (‍HeHeText for male Traveler/SheSheText for female Traveler‍)'s onboard right now for the celebration, isn't (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍)?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_huixing_04.ogg Huixing: Yeah, but just one celebration together is not enough. You know what we mean, Captain!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: Alright, alright, I get it now. There is something special about you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). You earned everyone's respect, myself included.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: So it goes without saying that The Crux would be honored to have a crew member such as yourself.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_furong_07.ogg Furong: No doubt about that!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: But then again, a hero like yourself doesn't just set off on a journey without some bigger purpose in mind.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: So should a hero really drop what they are doing just to spend day after day drifting at sea with us?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: If that were the case, then The Crux, known for always moving forward to the next horizon, would instead be holding someone back.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_huixing_05.ogg Huixing: Right... Uh, I guess we didn't think that part through.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: Remember, rather than seeking out strong members to join us, you should be focusing on making yourselves the strongest that you can be! If we are powerful, they will come to us.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: Isn't that why everyone here chose to come aboard in the first place?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_seadrake_05.ogg Sea Drake: Yes... A strong sailor is always looking for a sturdy ship!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_furong_08.ogg Furong: I guess I almost forgot the first lesson you ever taught me... Thanks for the reminder, Captain!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905001_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: Just be sure you all keep that in mind! There's no more need to hound the Traveler. As you were! The Traveler and I have something to discuss.


Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: I'm glad you came, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Welcome back aboard.
 The crew seemed excited to see me. Thanks for helping me out back there.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: Hey, don't mention it! As a host, it would be pretty embarrassing to continue letting my guest be put on the spot like that.
 You run a tight ship, Captain.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: Do I? Haha! To be honest, I don't care for that kind of reputation. I don't want people to see me like some big-shot official from Yujing Terrace.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: But I'll take it as a compliment. I'm glad you see me as well-respected.
 You are a wise leader.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: Heh, thanks. I'll take that.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: Some rumors have it that the leader of The Crux is so powerful that she could slay the mighty leviathan, Haishan, without breaking a sweat.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: I can't go getting too caught up in my own reputation, though. That's certainly not how The Crux made it to where we are today.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: As the head of the fleet, my task is to keep us on the right course, no matter how turbulent the seas may become.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: But then again, the crew isn't usually this riled up. It's not that they're arrogant, they're just bubbling with ambition, that's all.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: Their excitement today comes from their great respect for you — both your strength and your character... So please, don't take it the wrong way.
 Why would I? I'm actually quite interested in the life of a sailor. (This dialogue option leads to Sailor Training.)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_11.ogg Beidou: Oh, is that so? Well, it just so happens that we're doing some recruitment and training for new crew members while we're back. It'll be a first-rate chance to learn the life of a sailor.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_12.ogg Beidou: Since you're interested, why don't you come along and experience a sailor's life firsthand?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_13.ogg Beidou: I'm curious to see if you'll take the sea by storm in the same way you have on land.
 Alright, Captain. Show me the ropes.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_14.ogg Beidou: Good, come with me, I've got something interesting for you to see.
 Maybe not by storm, but I'll try and make a splash?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_15.ogg Beidou: Nice! Come with me. Let's see how big of a splash you can manage."
(Proceed to Sailor Training)
 Why would I? I should be thanking them for taking me to Inazuma. (This dialogue option leads to Private Chat.)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_16.ogg Beidou: All good then. Great. Actually, speaking of Inazuma, I think your good luck must have rubbed off on me on the way over. I made an interesting find on the beach shortly after we parted ways.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905004_beidou_17.ogg Beidou: Let's talk about it over there, where it's a little quieter.
(Proceed to Private Chat)

Private Chat[]
 Step DescriptionThe Crux returns safely from Inazuma and is preparing to celebrate. The only difference is that today, you're the guest of honor...

(Go to a quiet spot to talk details with Beidou)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: So after we dropped you off in Ritou, we found a shipwreck nearby. Probably belonged to Inazuman pirates.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: We searched the wreckage and found a map.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: At first, I thought it was a nautical chart. I was thinking we might discover a new sailing route if we were lucky.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: But after a closer look, I realized that it wasn't a map of the sea at all. It was a Liyue treasure map, and no ordinary one at that.
 Is an evil chi active in the area?
 Is there a great demonic presence in the area?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: Um... nothing like that. I just mean that the map was a mess. So it was the most I could do to figure out that the treasure was probably in Liyue.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: As for its exact location, I have no idea.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: I'd say I've explored Liyue pretty extensively, but still, this one managed to beat me.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: So I thought of you. Nobody can beat you when it comes to treasure hunting on land, right?
 You know me too well.
 I wouldn't say I'm the best treasure hunter of all time... only the best to date.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: Is that right? Well then, it looks like I'm in good hands.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: Here's the map, see what you can make of it.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_11.ogg Beidou: So? Where do you think it is?
 I think it's Guili Plains, just very badly drawn. (This dialogue option leads to Guili Plains Treasure Hunt.)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_12.ogg Beidou: Guili Plains... Huh, I never would have gotten that. How can you tell?
 Call it a treasure hunter's intuition.
 Compared against a regular map, the topography of the area most closely resembles the Guili Plains.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_13.ogg Beidou: Ohh... okay then.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_14.ogg Beidou: So you do live up to the hype. I can't believe you noticed that — you sure have an eye for detail.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_15.ogg Beidou: Let's head over there and take a look. I'll need you to help me zero in on the specific location once we're there.
(Continue to Guili Plains Treasure Hunt)
 I think it's Qingce Village, just very badly drawn. (This dialogue option leads to Qingce Village Treasure Hunt.)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_16.ogg Beidou: Qingce Village... I don't see the resemblance at all. How'd you come to that conclusion?
 Call it a treasure hunter's intuition.
 Qingce Village has a lot of terraced land, which seems to match the contour lines on this map.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_17.ogg Beidou: Ohh... okay then.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_18.ogg Beidou: I'm definitely a rookie at this, haha. But your word's good enough for me. Time for a trip to Qingce.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905003_beidou_19.ogg Beidou: You're coming with me, of course. I'll need you to help me zero in on the specific location once we're there.
(Continue to Qingce Village Treasure Hunt)

Sailor Training[]

Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: Chief Mate Juza is breaking in the newcomers. But, I think we can spare you the tedium of that.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: After this, the new crew members will be arranged into two teams for more specialized training, according to their own aptitudes and the needs of the fleet.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: One team will learn comprehensive survival skills, including maritime emergency rescue, marine meteorology, psychological counseling, and so on.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: They will serve as the support team for the fleet, ensuring safe navigation. That's why we call them "The Shield of The Crux."
 What's the other team? "The Spear of The Crux"?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: That's right. You catch on quick.
 What's the other team? "The Pen of The Crux"?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: The Pen of The Crux? Hahahaha! That's a wild idea.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: Unfortunately, this ain't the Wanwen Bookhouse, kid.
 What's the other team? "The Vision of The Crux"?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: The Vision of The Crux? Hahahaha! We don't have that many Visions, kid.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: As one might expect, we call the other team the "Spear of The Crux," because they will be learning about naval warfare. They will make up the armed portion of our crew.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: Also, they are responsible for handling the fleet's cargo deals.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_11.ogg Beidou: So, what do you think? Which team is for you?
 The Shield of The Crux. (This dialogue option leads to Training: The Shield of The Crux.)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_12.ogg Beidou: Heh, as I expected. You have a will to protect others.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_13.ogg Beidou: There are two main subjects that The Shield of The Crux focuses on, survival knowledge and entertainment.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_14.ogg Beidou: As I was saying earlier, survival knowledge includes prevention of injuries and diseases at sea, navigation and cartography, basic meteorology, etc.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_15.ogg Beidou: You can go learn about these skills from Yinxing, Huixing, and Liushi. They are all seasoned hands in their respective fields.
 I thought I would be learning from you, Captain.
 There are crewmates who know even more than you, Captain?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_16.ogg Beidou: Each sailor has their own strengths and weaknesses. I'm no rookie, of course, but you shouldn't underestimate the knowledge of the crew.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_17.ogg Beidou: If there's anything I'm most proud of in the fleet, it's my people!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_18.ogg Beidou: Go and get to work. I'll have some questions to test you later. Heh, I look forward to seeing how you do.
(Continue to Life on the High Seas)
 The Spear of The Crux. (This dialogue option leads to Training: The Spear of The Crux.)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_19.ogg Beidou: Heh, you truly are an adventurer at heart.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_20.ogg Beidou: Let's start with the fundamentals for any armed crew member: basic boat handling.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905002_beidou_21.ogg Beidou: Follow me.

The Second Chilibrew Ingredient[]

(Look for High-quality Sweet Flowers)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Here we are! The Sweet Flowers growing here are some of the highest quality.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: I often pick them here, but... why are there so many monsters around?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Huh, let's take care of them first, then we can look for Sweet Flowers in the vicinity.
(Talk to Barbara)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: Whew... I guess that takes care of them.
 Piece of cake.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: You truly are the Honorary Knight, you barely broke a sweat.
 Think I slipped a disc.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: More than a few monsters, but you made it look easy.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: Ah! S—Stop right there, looks like you hurt yourself... On your arm there!
 Barely a graze, nothing to worry about.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: No no no, even a graze can turn into a wound of unimaginable evil if you let it.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: Wait just a second, I'll have it healed in no time.
Barbara begins to heal the Traveler...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: That should do it. Okay, let's have a look for these Sweet Flowers.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 01.ogg ???: H—Hello there... Excuse me, but aren't you the Deaconess of the Church of Favonius?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: ...Yes, I am... Are you alright?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 02.ogg ???: Praise the Archons! Please, can you heal me?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 03.ogg ???: I'm a... I'm a Hunter, from Springvale! I was attacked by monsters when I passed through here.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 04.ogg ???: I was lucky to have escaped, but please — won't you heal me?
 You're not... dressed like a hunter.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 05.ogg Uwe: I... decided to do some private hunting today — so I just threw on any old thing...
 The leader of the Springvale hunters... what's their name again?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 06.ogg Uwe: Leader... leader... That's gotta be, um... Is this a trick question...?
 Springvale's quite a distance away... What is it you're hunting out here?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 07.ogg Uwe: Forest boar! I'm hunting forest boar! Hahaha, when you think about it, isn't life just one big forest boar hunt...?
 You're dressed a bit like a Treasure Hoarder...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 08.ogg Uwe: Treasure who now? *cough* Don't be silly! Would a Treasure Hoarder get injured and then stop a couple of passers—by begging to be healed...?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 09.ogg Uwe: Bah! Don't be ridiculous... Me? A Treasure Hoarder?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 10.ogg Uwe: L—Look here, aren't these monster injuries? How could I have done this to myself?
 Well then, let's head to Springvale and see if we can't find out your identity...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 11.ogg Uwe: How can you be so heartless!? How could I make the journey with all these terrible injuries!?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 12.ogg Uwe: Hmph, it's no wonder, looking at you... you adventurers are all alike, suspicious by nature...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 13.ogg Uwe: Sister Deaconess, you believe me right? Heal me, I beg of you...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: ...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 13.ogg Barbara: Yes, I will heal you.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 14.ogg Barbara: Oh... His wounds look difficult to heal. I'll need some herbs... Can you watch him for me?
 ...No problem. See what you can find, I'll take care of him.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 15.ogg Barbara: Okay, I'm going to look for some Small Lamp Grass in the area.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 16.ogg Barbara: Please stay with him, and make sure no monsters get to him.
 I'll go with you, this fellow could do with some monster-hiding practice.
 It's too dangerous to go alone, let's go together. This fellow should be able to look after himself.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 14.ogg Uwe: You...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 15.ogg Uwe: Hmph... fine. Heartless adventurer...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 16.ogg Uwe: I'll stay hidden, Sister Deaconess, but please be back soon, I beg of you!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 17.ogg Barbara: We'll be back soon, don't worry.
(Continue to Healing Is My Job)
 Hold on, Barbara. He's a suspicious character, we should take him to see the Knights first.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 barbara 18.ogg Barbara: Oh... uh... okay. But I should heal him first...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 17.ogg Uwe: Wait a minute... Y'know, I'm suddenly feeling a lot better. Where was I...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 18.ogg Uwe: Uh, Sister Deaconess... I should be going. I won't be needing your healing today, thank you.
 Sir, stop where you are.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 19.ogg Uwe: ...But w—we're done here, no? Is there a problem? I—I haven't done anything...
 We just want to get you healed at the Church is all. What's the matter, shy?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 20.ogg Uwe: What's your problem? You're not making any sense! I just asked to be healed, is there some law against that?
 I'm just a humble Honorary Knight, no need to get excited... Take a walk with me.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900601 uwe 21.ogg Uwe: You think I'm afraid of you? If you wanna catch me, you better be up to the task!

Healing Is My Job[]

(Talk to Uwe again)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 20.ogg Uwe: Y—You got a problem? Stop looking at me like that...
(While looking for Small Lamp Grass)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Don't look so serious, I know what you're thinking.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: I've heard a lot about the criminal methods of the Treasure Hoarders around Mondstadt.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Usually, if I come across a person like this, I'd simply ask them to seek help from somebody at the Church.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: But this fellow is in serious condition, he needs urgent healing...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: After all, I've got an Honorary Knight at my side to protect me, right?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: Hmm, let's gather the Small Lamp Grass and head back so we can heal him.
(Talk to Uwe after picking up 3 Fresh Small Lamp Grass)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 01.ogg Uwe: Sister Deaconess... you're back!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: This should do the trick, hold on a moment...
 No sudden moves.
 I'm watching you.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 02.ogg Uwe: You adventurers... really are jumpy these days.
Barbara starts to heal Uwe...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: Alright, that should do it. But just to be safe, you should probably pay a visit to the Church.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 03.ogg Uwe: Haha... no need. I should be able to recover by myself.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 04.ogg Uwe: Uh... S—Sister Deaconess...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 05.ogg Uwe: Why... weren't you suspicious of me? Like the adventurer here?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 06.ogg Uwe: Surely you've heard about the Treasure Hoarders and their methods... haha...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 07.ogg Uwe: Feigning injury by the roadside, begging for healing to get close to travelers, then striking at the opportune moment... Y'know, stuff like that...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 08.ogg Uwe: And... that's just one of their methods. Weren't you... worried that I might've been looking to harm you?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: Um... It crossed my mind.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 09.ogg Uwe: And yet... Why did you still help me?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: The fact was, you needed healing, right?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: And you hadn't done anything wrong. You just asked me for help.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: Whatever your true identity, in my eyes, you were merely a person in need of healing.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 10.ogg Uwe: Sister Deaconess...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 11.ogg Uwe: The truth is... I am a Treasure Hoarder. My plan was to feign injury in order to take advantage of the situation...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 12.ogg Uwe: But I ran into a group of monsters — I barely made it out. Then I realized I actually had to seek help from someone, anyone...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 13.ogg Uwe: But travelers all kept their distance, none of them believed me... Until you showed up.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 14.ogg Uwe: I—I can't thank you enough for healing me. I feel strong enough to carry on now... I won't trouble you anymore.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 13.ogg Barbara: Oh... Well, the best thing would be for you to come back to Mondstadt with us. The Church can help with your treatment, you're not fully healed yet...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 15.ogg Uwe: Please! I've taken up enough of your time.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 16.ogg Uwe: Oh, these are for you. I'm afraid I have nothing of value to give, but... I picked these Sweet Flowers from nearby.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 17.ogg Uwe: Take them, as thanks for healing me. I will remember your kindness.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 18.ogg Uwe: In the future, if you have any trouble with... Treasure Hoarders... just mention my name, Uwe. I guarantee, they won't dare touch the hem of your jacket!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 19.ogg Uwe: I must go. Farewell.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 14.ogg Barbara: Hehe, what a strange character... but I hope his wounds will be okay.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 15.ogg Barbara: At least we got a hold of some Sweet Flowers! We were running out of time for me to whip you up some Chilibrew.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 16.ogg Barbara: Wow... this is a great batch! That's everything we need. It's getting late, let's get back to Mondstadt.
(Arriving at Mondstadt)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Well, we're back. Whew... that was pretty tiring.
 Why did you choose to heal that guy even though you knew he was suspicious?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: I'm a deaconess, healing the wounded is something I must do.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Besides... I have a Vision. Even if he did try anything, I'd have been able to handle it.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: Not to mention, I had the Honorary Knight with me. If there'd been any danger... you would definitely have protected me, right?
 And if I hadn't been there...?
 What if you'd been on your own?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: If I was alone... Mm...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: Well, for a Vision-bearer, I'm more adept at healing. If there were too many enemies, I guess I would've been defeated after a while...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: However, because I would've been alone... I wouldn't have risked an ambush by stopping to heal him myself. I would've just left some herbs with him instead.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: I'm good at remembering self-defense tactics like that.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: After all, as Sister Victoria always says... don't go around healing people in the wild...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: Then again... What's the point of having a Vision if I can't stretch the rules once in a while? Hehe...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: Oh — the Chilibrew! It shouldn't take long to make... Why don't you wait for me in the garden next to the Adventurers' Guild?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: I'll bring it straight over when it's ready.

The Arataki Support Group...?[]
 Quest DescriptionThe Police Station's Uesugi is fretting about the Arataki Gang...

(Go to the Police Station and talk to Uesugi)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I do apologize. As I've explained before, it's a constant battle for Mr. Arataki with his mental instabilities. I know it's caused no end of problems for you, and I can assure you that he regularly feels very remorseful about that, too.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...Exactly, yes, and that's why he has such a big heart for other people struggling with similar issues. Uh, the Arataki Support Group was actually founded precisely to try and bring something positive out of that...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Yes, all of them are good, honest people underneath. It's just a shame that they still haven't found a cure, after all this time...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...Oh but — no no no, not me. I'm not a sufferer.
 What are you doing?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Hmm? Ah, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), just the person I need.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Mr. Uesugi, my friend here can confirm everything I've told you about Mr. Arataki. To put it simply, he experiences strong emotion more acutely than most, and easily becomes highly excitable.
 I guess that's true...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: And, deep down inside, all the members of the Arataki Support Group are some of the most down-to-earth, kindhearted people you could ever meet.
 Yeah, I guess so...
 (But that seems besides the point...)
 (But that's not the full story...)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 uesugi 01.ogg Uesugi: Huh, even the Traveler is here to vouch for the Arataki Gang. So you're saying we've had them wrong all this time?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 shinobu 08.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...
 (Shinobu is giving us the look which means "play along"...)
 Otherwise, why would Shinobu have stayed in the gang?
 Otherwise, how would the Arataki Gang have been able to keep Shinobu?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 uesugi 02.ogg Uesugi: You make a good point. You know, I heard Yoriki Owada saying how the Arataki Gang's deputy has studied abroad and is well-versed in the law... I was wondering why someone with that much talent would choose to stay with the Arataki Gang...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 uesugi 03.ogg Uesugi: Here's the thing, though: We have solid evidence that those three were illegally posting flyers everywhere, and we've received a lot of complaints from members of the local community. I appreciate what you're saying and everything, I'm just not sure I can let them off so easily...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 shinobu 09.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Please accept my sincere apologies once again for all of that.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 shinobu 10.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Mamoru and the others probably believed that they would be able to reach more people in need this way. Unfortunately, they were so eager to help that they ended up causing more problems than they solved.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 shinobu 11.ogg Kuki Shinobu: The Arataki Support Group assumes full responsibility. We will work quickly to restore the clean and tidy living environment that the community quite rightly expects.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 shinobu 12.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...But with only myself available, I'm afraid that it could take a very long time to remove all the flyers. Having their help would've made things much quicker...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 shinobu 13.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I'm just a little concerned that if progress is too slow, the complaints will only keep coming, which ultimately only makes more work for you and your colleagues.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 uesugi 04.ogg Uesugi: I... Ugh, alright, fine. I'll go fetch them... but don't think I'm gonna make a habit of this!
Uesugi escorts the Arataki Gang out of the Police Station...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 mamoru 01.ogg Mamoru: Finally, we're saved...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 akira 01.ogg Akira: Hey, hey! I knew Shinobu wouldn't abandon us!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 genta 01.ogg Genta: What uuuup! The Arataki Gang is back in town!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 shinobu 14.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Ahem! Sorry, they're getting a little over-excited at the prospect of being able to serve the community.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 uesugi 05.ogg Uesugi: Alright, guys... make sure you get every last one of those flyers back, okay?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 uesugi 06.ogg Uesugi: And don't forget to apologize to the residents and ask for forgiveness!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 shinobu 15.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I assure you, there won't be any problems — will there, guys?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 akira 02.ogg Akira: Uhh... Y—Yes! No problems!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 genta 02.ogg Genta: W—We'll be sure to get the job done!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 uesugi 07.ogg Uesugi: *sigh* ...I really hope letting them go was the right decision... They'd better not cause any more trouble...
(Talk to Uesugi again)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914101 uesugi 08.ogg Uesugi: I really hope letting them go was the right decision...

Ways and Means[]

(Talk to Kuki Shinobu)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 mamoru 01.ogg Mamoru: Alright then, Shinobu, we, uh... will go apologize then?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 akira 01.ogg Akira: Yeah, we'd better be quick, or...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Not so fast.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 genta 01.ogg Genta: Ahhh!!!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Last month, you almost got the fire brigade out when you were roasting Lavender Melons. Five days ago, you angered the whole neighborhood by hosting The Great Singalong in the middle of the night. And today, you go plastering flyers all over town...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: How many times will you have to be arrested before this stops?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 mamoru 02.ogg Mamoru: But... we put up those flyers to tell everyone how great the Arataki Gang is...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: No more excuses. You know, I had real plans at Uyuu Restaurant today... but it looks like you guys need a little slap on the wrist first.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 akira 02.ogg Akira: Eek! Help, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 genta 02.ogg Genta: P—Please, you don't wanna do this... you could have just left us in jail instead!
 (Step forward to defend them.)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Don't feel sorry for them, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). They need to learn their lesson.
 It's more important that they apologize...
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 Oh? Then allow me!
(Proceed to Branch 2)
 (Slowly back away...)
(Proceed to Branch 3)

Branch 1[]

 It's more important that they apologize...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 mamoru 03.ogg Mamoru: Yes, yes! Shinobu, please just let us go apologize!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 akira 03.ogg Akira: If someone else complains, they'll only arrest us again...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 genta 03.ogg Genta: ...and then you'll be forced to help us out again.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Hmph... I suppose I'll have to teach you a lesson later.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: So then. Where did you post all your flyers, hmm?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 akira 04.ogg Akira: Well... umm... we left a few on the counter at Shimura's...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 genta 04.ogg Genta: We figured that people might take a look while they're eating... Also, the Bulletin Board at Tsukumomono Groceries...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 mamoru 04.ogg Mamoru: And... uh... also... also, um...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 08.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Just say it.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 mamoru 05.ogg Mamoru: Right! Of course! ...Also, on the mountain path leading up to the Grand Narukami Shrine—
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 akira 05.ogg Akira: We wanted to send the message, "Why pray to the gods when you can call for the Arataki Gang!" ...but we'd only distributed a few before a terrifying fox lady appeared right behind us!
 ...Really? How terrifying, exactly?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 genta 05.ogg Genta: Ahh! Don't make me relive the memory!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 mamoru 06.ogg Mamoru: ...W—Well anyway, by the time we'd recovered our wits, we were already at the Police Station...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 akira 06.ogg Akira: We were actually pretty relieved to be there, under the circumstances...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 genta 06.ogg Genta: Yeah, 'cause it meant we'd escaped from the fox lady... Huh? Shinobu, why are you looking at us like that...?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 09.ogg Kuki Shinobu: It looks like I need to knock some serious sense into you after all.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 mamoru 07.ogg Mamoru: Y—You said it was just gonna be a slap on the wrist!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 akira 07.ogg Akira: We've learned our lesson, honest!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 genta 07.ogg Genta: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), help!
 ...Let's go apologize at the shrine first!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 10.ogg Kuki Shinobu: No! Anywhere but the shrine!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 genta 08.ogg Genta: No way! We're not going back there! We're gonna stay as far away from her as possible...
 Shall we just get them to go apologize to Miko?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 akira 08.ogg Akira: No way! We're not going back there! We're gonna stay as far away from her as possible...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 mamoru 08.ogg Mamoru: Sh—Shinobu, w—we're gonna go apologize to Kanbei now, umm bye!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 mamoru 09.ogg Mamoru: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, and Aoi, too! Hey, wait up...
The three young rascals flee as fast as they can...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 11.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Huh, I swear I've never seen them run that fast before...
 Miko seems to have left a lasting impression on them.
 I think you may have scared them off...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 12.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Ugh... Of all the places they could cause a scene, they just had to pick the shrine...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 13.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...I guess I'll have to suck it up and go sort this out?
 I know a lot of people at the shrine...
 Why don't I come with you?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 14.ogg Kuki Shinobu: It's not that I don't know anyone there, it's just... *sigh* Okay, fine.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 15.ogg Kuki Shinobu: It'll probably go more smoothly with you there. The sooner this is over, the better... I don't want to spend a second longer at that place than I have to.
 (This reminds me... at The Chasm...)
 (Shinobu said she doesn't like the shrine...)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 16.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...Anyway, thank you for coming with me, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
(Proceeds to To the Shrine)

Branch 2[]

 Oh? Then allow me!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 17.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...Really?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 genta 09.ogg Genta: Ah!?
 Punishment isn't necessary to teach them a lesson.
 Sometimes, rules are more effective.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 18.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Rules? You're saying... we should lay down some rules for the guys?
 The Knights of Favonius have a handbook...
 The Millelith also abides by a strict contract...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 19.ogg Kuki Shinobu: It's true, having a clear set of regulations and penalties could help establish behavioral norms for our members.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 20.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Is that really why I can never get them to change? Because the Arataki Gang doesn't have any written rules and regulations?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 mamoru 10.ogg Mamoru: Hey, are you getting this? What do they mean?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 akira 09.ogg Akira: I'm not sure, but it sounds like... it doesn't involve us getting beaten up?
 You could write an "Arataki Gang Handbook" for them to study.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 21.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Hmm... let me think about it. The "Arataki Gang Handbook"...
Mamoru: S—Study? They're not gonna make us memorize a whole book, are they?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 akira 10.ogg Akira: No way... I'd take the beating over that!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 genta 10.ogg Genta: Hey, guys — Shinobu seems distracted. Maybe we should slip away while we can...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 22.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...Yes, if we can make them learn the rules by heart, it's sure to have some amount of influence on their behavior.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 23.ogg Kuki Shinobu: But knowing what they're like, to really get it into their heads... I'll have to assign plenty of homework assignments and give them pop quizzes each day... Huh?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 24.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Where'd they go?
 I... I didn't see...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 25.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Tsk... Well, given that this way is Tenshukaku and the Police Station, you can bet they'll have fled in the opposite direction!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 26.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Who knows what chaos they'll cause next if we leave them to their own devices...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914102 shinobu 27.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I'm gonna need your help, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Let's catch these kids before they do something stupid.

Shrine Maiden Suggestion[]
 Quest DescriptionAccording to Miko's "suggestion," you work as shrine maidens at the shrine...

(Talk to Takuma)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 takuma 01.ogg Takuma: *sigh* Should I take the risk, or... Huh, who are you?
 We're shrine maidens.
 You can talk to us about whatever's bothering you.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 takuma 02.ogg Takuma: You're shrine maidens? They sure dress different these days, I suppose this is the Grand Narukami Shrine, after all...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 takuma 03.ogg Takuma: I came across a potential business opportunity recently. They say that by financing an overseas merchant ship, you can make a 40% profit on your investment in three months.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 takuma 04.ogg Takuma: Several of my friends have already received their returns and want me to go in with them on a bigger investment...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 takuma 05.ogg Takuma: For some reason, I was feeling a little unsure about it, so I thought I'd come to the shrine and see what the Great Narukami thinks.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 takuma 06.ogg Takuma: But the fortune slip I drew is neither positive nor negative. I'm at a loss on what to make of it...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Most of the fortune slips in the shrine are pretty ambiguous.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 takuma 07.ogg Takuma: Could it be that... our god wants me to come back and draw another slip tomorrow? And if the same happens again, then... maybe the day after that?
 You'd be guaranteed a "Great Fortune" slip eventually.
 Sooner or later, you'd draw a "Great Misfortune."
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: If you have all that time to draw slips, why not spend it on learning more about this merchant ship instead?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I've heard of a scam where people make up a bogus investment and promise high returns in a short period.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: In reality, they just use the new investors' money to pay existing investors their "profits."
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Once people see the early investors making their money back, scores of other investors jump on the bandwagon, and then one day the people behind it just pack up and leave with the money...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 takuma 08.ogg Takuma: Oh, gosh... Come to think of it, they haven't given me any specifics about the shipping route or itinerary...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: By saying it's "overseas" and being economical with the details, they can filter out the folks who actually take the time to do their due diligence. It's another common tactic used by many scammers.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 takuma 09.ogg Takuma: Wow, is that true? Praise be to the Narukami! Clearly she has been watching over me amidst my confusion. Thankfully, I hadn't agreed to anything yet...
 Rather than thanking your god...
 Why don't you thank her first?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 takuma 10.ogg Takuma: Oh, yes, of course! Thank you, shrine maiden!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 takuma 11.ogg Takuma: Now that I think about it, I remember receiving similarly sound advice at this shrine in the past.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 takuma 12.ogg Takuma: That shrine maiden is long gone now, though. It's a real pity.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: R—Really, what a shame. But anyway, shouldn't you be getting back now to warn your friends?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 takuma 13.ogg Takuma: Oh, goodness — yes, I'll go and warn them all right away!
(After talking to Takuma)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914501 shinobu 08.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Here's hoping he manages to stop his friends in time. Hmph... Right, there's another visitor — let's see what he wants.

(Talk to Hayato)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 hayato 01.ogg Hayato: Huh... It seems even a change of scenery won't get the creative juices flowing... Hmm? Who are you?
 We're shrine maidens.
 You can ask us for advice if you have any issues.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 hayato 02.ogg Hayato: Shrine maidens, huh? I guess I could give that a try...
 It was Miko's idea.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 hayato 03.ogg Hayato: Oh, this was the Chief Editor's idea? Then no wonder it's so... novel, hehe.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 hayato 04.ogg Hayato: *sigh* I, on the other hand, am all out of ideas. So I came to the shrine to pray for inspiration...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Well? Has it worked?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 hayato 05.ogg Hayato: N—Not so far... I guess I wasn't sincere enough, or something. But I'm gonna come back tomorrow — I'm sure I'll stir the heart of our god eventually!
 It should be readers' hearts that you're trying to stir.
 At this rate, your next deadline will arrive before inspiration does.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Have you ever thought about going traveling?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Inspiration comes from life experience. The more places you go, the more people you meet, the more you'll have to share with your readers.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: It's natural to run out of new material when you're in the same place doing the same things every day.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 hayato 06.ogg Hayato: That's true... I haven't gone out exploring in a long time.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 hayato 07.ogg Hayato: Actually, Ma'am... You look very familiar. Have we met before? Here in the shrine?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: No. You must be mistaking me for someone else.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Lack of social contact can easily lead to a deterioration in facial recognition abilities.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 hayato 08.ogg Hayato: Seriously? Oh, man... That's it, I'm packing my bags right away. Time to go traveling!
(After talking to Hayato)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Hmm? Oh, that thing I said about facial recognition? ...Probably depends on the individual.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914502 shinobu 08.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Anyway, forget that. We have a new visitor, let's go greet them.

Omamori Memento[]

(Talk to Asami)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914503 inagihotomi 01.ogg Inagi Hotomi: Please wait a moment, Ma'am. We'll work something out for you as soon as possible...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914503 asami 01.ogg Asami: Oh, it's okay, there's no need to rush...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914503 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: What's wrong?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914503 inagihotomi 02.ogg Inagi Hotomi: Ah, perfect. This lady's granddaughter is going abroad soon, and she'd like to give her an omamori before she leaves.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914503 inagihotomi 03.ogg Inagi Hotomi: Unfortunately, we just ran out... Could I trouble you to make some more?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914503 inagihotomi 04.ogg Inagi Hotomi: You should be able to find the brocade bags and knots on both sides of the shrine. For the paper slips that go inside, just ask Maki.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914503 inagihotomi 05.ogg Inagi Hotomi: Um... I don't think I need to go into detail on how to write the blessing and put it all together.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914503 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...No, I can handle the rest.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914503 asami 02.ogg Asami: Hmm... Ah, hehe, thank you dear.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914503 inagihotomi 06.ogg Inagi Hotomi: Great, I'll take her to wash her hands first. We'll see you in front of the Sacred Sakura when you're ready.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914503 asami 03.ogg Asami: Ah, thank you all so very much. May the Great Narukami bless you.
(Talk to Asami again)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914503 inagihotomi 07.ogg Inagi Hotomi: This way, Ma'am. Mind the steps...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914503 asami 04.ogg Asami: Oh, thank you so much for all your help...

(Talk to Maki)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914507 maki 01.ogg Maki: You need paper slips for omamori blessings? I have a few right here.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914507 maki 02.ogg Maki: Oh, but I'm afraid I don't have a pen...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914507 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Don't worry, I got it.
(Talk to Maki again)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914507 maki 03.ogg Maki: I hope your omamori will bring our visitors good luck.
(Draw the knots)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914505 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Huh, so this is where the knots are.
(Draw the brocade bags)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914506 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Brocade bags — check.
(After collecting all the items)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: That's everything. Let's go give it to the lady.

(Talk to Asami)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 inagihotomi 01.ogg Inagi Hotomi: Ah, there you are. Is the omamori ready?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Almost, I just need to write the blessing. One second.
Kuki Shinobu finishes the omamori...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 inagihotomi 02.ogg Inagi Hotomi: Here, Ma'am, please come and pray over here.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 asami 01.ogg Asami: Oh, Great Narukami, please watch over my granddaughter and keep her safe on her journey...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...
 Aren't you going to join them?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: This is a job for a real shrine maiden, like Inagi. I wouldn't be suited to it.
 Why didn't you convince her to leave, like the others?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: There are some things that mortals are powerless to control. Sometimes, praying to the gods is the only thing people can do.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Not to mention that the omamori will mean a lot to her granddaughter. Maybe it'll encourage her to stay safe on her travels.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: So in terms of the outcome, it's beneficial.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 08.ogg Kuki Shinobu: The only people I can't stand are the ones who don't think for themselves and at least try to solve their own problems. By relying on the gods for everything, all they're doing is neglecting themselves and those around them.
 Is that why you don't want to be a shrine maiden?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 09.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...No, that has nothing to do with it. The reason I don't want to be a shrine maiden is that I don't enjoy it.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 10.ogg Kuki Shinobu: But enough about that. It looks like they've just about finished, I think? Let's go over there and say our goodbyes.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 asami 02.ogg Asami: Thank you ever so much. When my granddaughter returns next year, I promise to bring her here so we can pay our respects together.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 inagihotomi 03.ogg Inagi Hotomi: You're welcome, Ma'am. Make sure to watch your step on the way down.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 asami 03.ogg Asami: I will, I will.
 Do you need any assistance on the way down?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 asami 04.ogg Asami: Don't you worry, now, I've walked this path many a time before.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 asami 05.ogg Asami: Oh yes... I don't believe I've thanked you yet, have I? Thank you for the omamori. I'll make sure that my granddaughter keeps it with her.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 11.ogg Kuki Shinobu: You're welcome. Just doing my job.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 asami 06.ogg Asami: Hehe, it's been a long time since we last met each other at this shrine, hasn't it? So, you finally came back?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 12.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Hmm? I think you've mistaken me for someone else...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 asami 07.ogg Asami: Oh? Really... Well, perhaps my hearing isn't as good as it used to be.
 (That's a point. She didn't seem surprised that we're shrine maidens.)
 (Maybe she has eye trouble, too?)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 asami 08.ogg Asami: Although, this is very strange, you sound exactly like another shrine maiden I remember. She didn't talk much, but I remember her voice very well...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 asami 09.ogg Asami: ...*sigh* Anyway, I hope I can hear your voice again when I return with my granddaughter next year.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 13.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...
 She's gone...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 14.ogg Kuki Shinobu: *sigh*
 It seems like this wasn't your first time as a shrine maiden...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 15.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...Yeah, you're right. I once did a stint here as a trainee shrine maiden. It was arranged by my family.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 16.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Unfortunately, I have no happy memories of that period. I just remember the way my family would nag me about etiquette and remembering the rules every time I left the house.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 17.ogg Kuki Shinobu: And how they'd interrogate me every time I got back from the shrine to check that I'd been on my best behavior and hadn't upset any visitors... Not once did I get a simple "have a nice day" or "welcome back."
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 18.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I couldn't take it anymore so I quit. I was determined to be anything but a shrine maiden, so I studied bookkeeping, worked as an editor for a while, even sat for some exams to qualify as a chef.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 19.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I wear this mask to stop people from recognizing me, because I don't want them to pry into my personal affairs.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 shinobu 20.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Okay, enough chit-chat. It's time to report back to you-know-who.
(Talk to Inagi Hotomi)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 inagihotomi 04.ogg Inagi Hotomi: I pray that the Electro Archon will bless that lady and her granddaughter...
 I wanted to ask — does she have vision problems?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 inagihotomi 05.ogg Inagi Hotomi: Oh, you noticed? Yes, she can't see very well. We always get a little worried for her safety every time she comes up the mountain.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 inagihotomi 06.ogg Inagi Hotomi: But she always refuses our offers to help. She insists that she knows the route like the back of her hand after walking it so many times in her life...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 inagihotomi 07.ogg Inagi Hotomi: Luckily, there are shrine maidens along the way who can at least keep an eye on her.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914509 inagihotomi 08.ogg Inagi Hotomi: May the Electro Archon watch over her and her granddaughter on their respective journeys...

The Day's Wages[]

(Talk to Yae Miko)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: Ah, good show today, both of you. It was so much fun to watch.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: Would you be interested in continuing to work as shrine maidens? Or perhaps you'd like to work as editors at Yae Publishing House instead?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: It would be a terrible shame to let such fascinating individuals slip away out of my reach.
 No thanks.
 Please, let me go.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Regrettably, I must decline, Lady Guuji.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: The shrine and Yae Publishing House are both fantastic places to work... They're just not for me.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: *sigh* Alright... Well, keeping you around under duress would only take all the fun out of it.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 yaemiko 05.ogg Yae Miko: Here, these are your wages, as promised. Not a single Mora short.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...Wages? No need, Lady Guuji. I'm here today to make amends...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 yaemiko 06.ogg Yae Miko: Oh, don't worry. I've already deducted the damages incurred by those boisterous boys from your amount.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 yaemiko 07.ogg Yae Miko: If you don't take the payment now, I'll be forced to send someone to deliver the package to the Arataki Gang.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 yaemiko 08.ogg Yae Miko: Now who should I send... Hmm... Miyuki, perhaps?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Ahem! No need to go to all that trouble, Lady Guuji. I'll take it today.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 yaemiko 09.ogg Yae Miko: Good. How about you, little one? I trust you don't have any reason to refuse?
 No, I don't.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 yaemiko 10.ogg Yae Miko: That's more like it. Ah, one more thing...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 yaemiko 11.ogg Yae Miko: You mustn't open the package until after you leave the shrine. Otherwise... you will be cursed with bad luck.
(Obtain Salary Bag)
(Talk to Yae Miko again)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 yaemiko 12.ogg Yae Miko: What's that? You want to open it now?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914511 yaemiko 13.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm, well, if something bad happens, don't expect me to pick up the pieces.

(Leave the shrine)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914512 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: This should be far enough.
 Is there really a curse...?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914512 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: She's always saying things like that. There's probably nothing in here but plain old Mora.
 Really...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914512 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Let's see... yep, just Mora... Wait, what the...?
 What's wrong?
 Careful!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914512 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: It's nothing, I'm just surprised by the amount... The shrine maiden gig was surprisingly lucrative...
 But you still won't go back to that life, right?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914512 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Definitely not. No amount of Mora could make me enjoy that job.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914512 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Let's see your share, then. With no damages deducted, it should be even more, right?
 Okay, lemme see...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914512 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: That's weird, it's just a single thin sheet...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914512 shinobu 08.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Wait... what are you laughing at, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?

The Detective's Disappearance[]

(Go to Bantan Sango Detective Agency)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 01.ogg Ryuuji: What if the Traveler is also unavailable... What am I supposed to do?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 sango 01.ogg Sango: Well, that's your problem. It was your choice to get into this mess.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 sango 02.ogg Sango: Oh, but fortunately for you, it appears your savior has just arrived.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 02.ogg Ryuuji: Hmm? Ah, Traveler! Great, you made it.
 Don't worry, I'm available.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 sango 03.ogg Sango: Well, it's not like you were ever really busy to begin with.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 03.ogg Ryuuji: Ugh, Sango!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 04.ogg Ryuuji: Compared to the Traveler, you're the one who has too much free time.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 sango 04.ogg Sango: No, I'm very busy. I'm busy standing here... I have to stand here all day.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 05.ogg Ryuuji: Even if it's a commission you're unwilling to take, your excuse is just pathetic.
 A commission you're unwilling to take?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 06.ogg Ryuuji: Yes, that's why I've asked you to come over. Allow me to explain.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 07.ogg Ryuuji: A key member of the Tenryou Commission has recently gone missing. No one has seen them and their whereabouts are currently unknown.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 08.ogg Ryuuji: The Tenryou Commission has entrusted us to find this person discreetly because it would be a hassle for them to look for this person openly, for a variety of reasons.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 09.ogg Ryuuji: Their name is...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 sango 05.ogg Sango: Kujou Sara. That's right, the general has gone missing.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 10.ogg Ryuuji: *sigh* ...If the general was really missing, the Tenryou Commission would have flipped Inazuma on its head by now. And do you think they would only commission us for a case like that?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 11.ogg Ryuuji: Please ignore Sango's nonsense, Traveler. In fact, the missing person's name is Shikanoin Heizou.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 12.ogg Ryuuji: He works as a special detective at the Police Station. Although his rank is merely a Doushin, he is quite competent and held in high regard by the Police Station.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 sango 06.ogg Sango: Ah! Do they think he's more competent than me?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 13.ogg Ryuuji: *sigh* We get that you don't want to help, Sango, but could you at least try not to make things more difficult here.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 14.ogg Ryuuji: Sorry Traveler, even though I accepted the commission...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 15.ogg Ryuuji: As you can see, Sango's less than thrilled to be involved in this case.
 Because the pay is too low?
 Because there are too few clues?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 sango 07.ogg Sango: Nope! Not even close!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 sango 08.ogg Sango: If you really want to know why, it's because I absolutely refuse to deal with that brat's nonsense.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 sango 09.ogg Sango: The only news that could make me happier than "Shikanoin has gone missing," would be "Shikanoin has been missing for 100 years."
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 16.ogg Ryuuji: Ahem... Needless to say, Sango and Heizou have a bit of a history.
 I see what you mean... they're competitors.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 17.ogg Ryuuji: Hum... Ah well, it's a little more serious than that.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 18.ogg Ryuuji: According to Sango, Heizou was an obstacle in her path to the "Temple of Truth"...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 sango 10.ogg Sango: Like a yappy dog that was constantly in the way!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 19.ogg Ryuuji: *sigh* Even though Heizou has... a "unique" personality, he's actually a nice guy. Really, I've learned a lot from him.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 20.ogg Ryuuji: So I can't just ignore this case, even if Sango doesn't approve. At the very least, I could entrust the commission to someone capable and trustworthy... like you, Traveler!
 I see, so you're outsourcing it to me.
 I see, so you're basically the middleman.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 21.ogg Ryuuji: Huh? No no, it's not like that! Listen, I'll pay the entire amount originally promised by the Tenryou Commission, and I'll even personally throw in some additional funds.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 22.ogg Ryuuji: I'm really hoping you can take this commission, Traveler.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 23.ogg Ryuuji: If Heizou truly is in danger, I know he'll be safer with you by his side.
 Are you close with him?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 24.ogg Ryuuji: Actually, we get along great, but Sango has always asked me to keep my distance and not to act like I know him in public settings.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 25.ogg Ryuuji: So, when people ask, I usually just say I've met Shikanoin a few times. If it hadn't been for today's incident, I'd...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 26.ogg Ryuuji: Ahem... Well, let's not get into that. Anyway, could you please help look for him?
 No problem, but I'll need more information.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 27.ogg Ryuuji: Great! We've learned that Heizou had expressed interest in Watatsumi Island before he disappeared.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 28.ogg Ryuuji: During the war, he apparently carried out some mission on Watatsumi Island, and once the war ended, he made frequent visits to the island.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 29.ogg Ryuuji: I heard you have a good standing with Sangonomiya. I think it might be a good idea to use that as a starting point for your investigation.
 Understood, I'll head there immediately.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903601 ryuji 30.ogg Ryuuji: Well, that's about all I have to tell you. Oh, please take this commission letter from the Police Station. If you find Heizou, return there and report back to them.
(Obtain Tenryou Commission's Missing Person Poster)
(Talk to Ryuuji again)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903602 ryuji 01.ogg Ryuuji: There's no time for delay, Traveler. Oh, I sure hope Heizou isn't in any danger.
 Tell me more about Shikanoin Heizou.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903602 ryuji 02.ogg Ryuuji: Oh, Heizou is quite the lively fellow! He's super talkative, active, and energetic, and he's always on the move.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903602 ryuji 03.ogg Ryuuji: Sango always compares him to a buzzing housefly... which I guess must be because he can accurately sniff out every bad apple in the pile.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903602 ryuji 04.ogg Ryuuji: In which case, Heizou isn't just some ordinary housefly, he's like the ace of flies!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903602 ryuji 05.ogg Ryuuji: Even with his nose plugged, eyes blindfolded, and ears covered, Heizou could still pinpoint the bad apples.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903602 ryuji 06.ogg Ryuuji: His skills are amazing, it's almost as if he relies on something other than just his five senses... You know, like a sixth sense! Or maybe it's pure intuition? Or he has divine favor? It's gotta be something like that...
 I see what you're getting at, but I think that's enough of the fly metaphor for now.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903602 ryuji 07.ogg Ryuuji: *sigh* Sango always says I make a fool of myself when I talk. I guess she's right...
 The whole fly metaphor is pretty bad, but I'd still like to hear more.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903602 ryuji 08.ogg Ryuuji: Ahem... Well, maybe we should chat another time. Sango is starting to stare at us.
(Talk to Sango again)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903603 sango 01.ogg Sango: You still haven't left yet? So perhaps you've changed your mind about looking for Heizou, huh? That would be best. Take it from me, getting involved with that guy is never a good idea.
 I'm curious, what's your issue with him?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903603 sango 02.ogg Sango: Let me put it this way, it wouldn't bother me at all if he disappeared forever. That's my issue.
 (Smile slightly and nod along.)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903603 sango 03.ogg Sango: Don't give me that look. Everyone's allowed to have a few people they can't stand, right?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903603 sango 04.ogg Sango: *sigh* In any case, I guess you should get moving, before that Shikanoin causes too much trouble.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903603 sango 05.ogg Sango: By the way, if you do happen to come across any signs of a most unfortunate demise, be sure to notify me... It'll bring me great joy.

(Ask around on Watatsumi Island)
(Talk to Shibata)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903604 shibata 01.ogg Shibata: Oh, it's you...! The captain of Swordfish II! My name is Shibata. I'm in charge of the watch here. May I inquire as to what the captain needs?
 I'm here for information about a specific individual.
You tell Shibata about the commission to find Heizou.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903604 shibata 02.ogg Shibata: So his name is Shikanoin Heizou, huh? Yes, I'm familiar with the detective, he used to stroll around the area.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903604 shibata 03.ogg Shibata: Her Excellency had assigned me to keep a close eye on him at the time, fearing that he would do something unpleasant, but I eventually realized that he acted more like he was on a trip or something.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903604 shibata 04.ogg Shibata: Come to think of it, I believe he was recently spotted in the area east of the Sangonomiya Shrine. Please feel free to go there and take a look for yourself.
(Talk to Shibata again)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 shibata 01.ogg Shibata: If you are looking for the young detective, please go to the area east of the Sangonomiya Shrine.

(Go to the east side of Watatsumi Island and look for Heizou)
(Talk to Sango near the quest marker — optional)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903606 sango 01.ogg Sango: Hmm? Didn't you go looking for that brat Shikanoin?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903606 sango 02.ogg Sango: Investigate? Why would I come to investigate his nonsense? Hmph! I was tired of staying in town, so I decided to go out for a walk.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903606 sango 03.ogg Sango: So get out of my hair and go back to whatever you were doing.
(Approach the Nobushi)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903607 heizou 01.ogg ???: C'mon you guys, I'm nothing but a poor tourist with empty pockets. Please, just let me go.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903607 ronin 01.ogg Nobushi: Just shut up and stay put!
(Defeat Nobushi and talk to the young man you rescued)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 01.ogg ???: Well well, look who it is!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 02.ogg ???: I was wondering who could be valiant enough to wipe the floor with these guys so easily, turns out it was the distinguished Traveler...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 03.ogg ???: Really, I can't thank you enough, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!
 Have we met?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 04.ogg ???: Of course, I was aware of you long before you arrived in Inazuma.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 05.ogg ???: Though the Sakoku Decree managed to keep the country locked up, it wasn't able to stop the incredible stories about you.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 06.ogg ???: Every day, all of those little stories would come scurrying over to my desk, like files with little feet.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 07.ogg ???: I was actually thinking about going to meet you once I wrapped up the business at hand. Who woulda guessed that you'd show up first, hehe...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 08.ogg ???: Ah, I got so excited that I nearly forgot to introduce myself.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Ahem! The name's Shikanoin Heizou, special detective of the Tenryou Commission. It's a pleasure to meet you, Traveler.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I wish you all the best on your journey through Teyvat, by the way.
 I've been commissioned to come find you.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Heh, I guess that means I've taken over as the main character in your story today.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 12.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I've always heard that you take commissions from all kinds of people, helping everyone out with everything you can imagine.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 13.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So now it's my turn to take your help, huh? Heh, don't mind if I do.
 Aren't you curious about whose commission it is?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 14.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: That was already obvious to me. It's no coincidence that you've arrived here.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 15.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: 'Cause that would be the stuff of an epic novel... the two protagonists of the story both travel to Watatsumi Island by chance, and cross paths as if by fate!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 16.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The Traveler from afar heroically rescues the weak and defenseless detective from the clutches of the ruthless Nobushi!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 17.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Traveler, you're so dreamy...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 18.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Unfortunately though, I don't believe in coincidences. So... guessing you came to me on the Police Station's commission, didn't you?
 How did you know that?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 19.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I'm a detective. Can you guess what gave it away?
 You're an oracle!
(+1 Heart)
 Did you deduce it from my demeanor?
 Did you deduce it from what I'm wearing?
 Did you deduce it from what I said?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 20.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Haha, sounds like you already have some ideas about the work of a detective.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 21.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Let me ask you this... What's that your little sidekick is holding? If I'm not mistaken, it's a commission letter from the Police Station.
Behind you, your "little sidekick" hastily hides the commission letter she was holding.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wh—What...? Uh, Paimon's just here to take a look...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 02a.ogg Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 02b.ogg Paimon: And hey! Who are you calling a little sidekick? Paimon was worried (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) might be in danger, so Paimon came to help!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Uh, why are you two staring at Paimon? Is Paimon not supposed to be here?
 I'm not staring, I'm just taking a look.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 22.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Yeah, I'm also just taking a look.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 04a.ogg Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 04b.ogg Paimon: Hmph, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) can look, but you can't.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 23.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Oh c'mon, don't be like that. After all, this is the first time I've seen a Voice. I must admit, I'm most intrigued.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh? Voice? What are you talking about?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 24.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: A Vision is an external magical focus, right? Well, similarly, a Voice is an external voice box.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 25a.ogg Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 25b.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I've heard that the Traveler isn't very talkative. But given how chatty you are, you must be (‍hishisText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) Voice, right?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: That sounds awful! Paimon's not somebody's voice! Paimon's emergency food!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: N—No! Uh, wait! Gah, Paimon's so upset she can't think straight. Paimon is Paimon! How dare you give Paimon such a terrible nickname...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: We came here to rescue you, but you actually opened the cage yourself... You were only pretending to be captured by the Nobushi, weren't you? Pretty suspicious if you ask Paimon...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Come out with it, mister! What kind of schemes are you up to?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 26.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Sheesh! For someone who says they don't want to be a Voice, you sure do talk a lot.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Mmmph!
 Yes, I'd also like to know what you're doing here, Detective Heizou.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 27.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Haha. Well, let me think for a moment... Yes, all this started a long time ago, during the war...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 28.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Kujou Takayuki, who was head of the Tenryou Commission at the time, had secretly asked me to investigate the military capabilities of Sangonomiya.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 29.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But I had already grown tired of the guy for a while, hehe, so I simply treated the trip as a paid vacation. I had heard that Watatsumi Island is really beautiful.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 30.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: As for the mission, I thought I'd just come up with some random excuses or whatever when I reported back.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 31.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But guess what, the first night I arrived on Watatsumi Island, I had a dream.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 32.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The dream contained only one message, an echo resounding from the depths of the earth that kept ringing in my ears, saying:

The Intuitive Commission[]

Heizou presses his lips close to your ear and whispers:
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 33.ogg "Something vital is missing on this island..."
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 34.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Isn't that bizarre? Something vital has gone missing on this island... Has something evaporated into thin air? Hmm, what could it be?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Paimon bets it must be something delicious!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: You know, because the soil of Watatsumi Island can't grow crops, there's a shortage of food here!
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 35.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Oh? Food, huh? How about you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? What do you think is missing?
 Hmm... it's missing music?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 36.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hmm, that was an unexpected response. It'd be right at home in a novel.
 Hmm... it's missing a deity?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 37.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You mean the Great Serpent? Well, that's an interesting answer, but the Electro Archon hasn't abandoned this place.
 Hmm... it's missing Paimon?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 38.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Haha, perhaps Watatsumi Island doesn't value your little partner as much as you do.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 13a.ogg Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 paimon 13b.ogg Paimon: Hmph! Well as long as (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) still appreciates Paimon, then that's fine.
 Maybe it was just a dream.
(−1 Heart)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 39.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You see now, I thought so too, but...
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 40.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: After that, I had the same dream over and over again.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 41.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Interestingly, I didn't have the same dream again after I left this place. So I became even more intrigued, was this really just some random dream?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 42.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Some people believe that dreams represent the divine's helping hand... which I suppose is understandable.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 43.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: However, if you ask me, dreams have nothing to do with the gods. Instead, they are flashes of intuition.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 44.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It was my intuition telling me that there was something important about this island that... POOF! suddenly vanished.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 45.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So I decided to accept this little commission from my intuition, and investigate to see if I could come up with any compelling findings.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 46.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Unfortunately, the investigation has had little progress up to this point.
 Does it have anything to do with these Nobushi?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 47.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Who knows... I felt there was something peculiar about them, so I pretended to get captured to see if there were any leads that would surface, and that's when you showed up.
 I'm sorry for interfering with your plans.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 48.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: No, don't worry about it. These guys were just a bunch of small fries. Besides, your arrival is much more important to me. I have a feeling you can help me find the answer to my dream.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 49.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So how would you like to partner up on this one? We can work together to solve the mystery.
 But I have a commission to fulfill, so I'll have to bring you back first.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 50.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Yes, of course, I understand. But, let me ask one more question: Did the Police Station say they are looking for me because of something important?
 No, they didn't.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 51.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Well, then it's probably nothing major. Most likely they're short on staff or something petty like that, and they happened to remember their model employee.
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 52.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So, since we're already here, why don't we just solve this puzzle together?
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 53.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Once everything is settled, I'll gladly accompany you back to the Police Station, or anywhere else you'd like to go. What do you think?
 Okay, I'm curious about your dream, too. I'll assist your investigation.

Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 54.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It's a deal then, partner!

(Proceed to The Camp's Secret)
 I think your dream's really out there, but I'll tag along since you're determined to stay.

Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 59.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: In that case, I'll accompany you back to the Police Station first. We can discuss the issue of Watatsumi Island later.
(Proceed to The Police Station Register)
 Your dream's really out there, so I think I should bring you back first. There's someone concerned about your safety.
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo lyycop001 1903605 heizou 60.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Someone concerned about my safety? Then it must be Ryuuji, right? Haha, I suppose if you insist...

Dialogue[]
 Quest DescriptionNoelle reveals to you that she is very anxious about the Knights of Favonius selection exam. At your suggestion, she decides to emulate the knights she knows in an attempt to overcome her sense of unease.
Outrider 101[]

(Obtain  Fresh Valberry)
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Yes, this should be plenty of Valberries...
(Pyro slimes appear)
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Oh? Pyro Slimes? Perfect, they can provide us with another ingredient we need.
(After obtaining all materials)
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Pyro Slime Condensate... Crushed Valberries...
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Good! Now I can start to make a Baron Bunny!
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Mm-hmm... Through here... Conceal the stitch... Done!
 It looks just like the ones Amber makes! Noelle, you are very handy!
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: ...Far from it... I know it looks the part on the outside, but I still don't know if it will really work...
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: There should be a hilichurl camp nearby. Let's place the Baron Bunny there and try it out.
(Head to the hilichurl camp and place the Baron Bunny)
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Ah! The hilichurls are coming back. Let's see if the Baron Bunny gets their attention.
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: What's going on... They're completely ignoring the Baron Bunny...
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: They're coming this way! (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), watch out!
(After defeating opponents)
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Ohhhh...
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: ...It neither attracted their attention nor exploded... In the end, all I managed to recreate was the outward appearance...
 Perhaps Amber controls it using her Pyro abilities...
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: I suppose the conclusion is: I can't become an Outrider like Amber.
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Hmm... Maybe I am not yet ready to carry out the work of a fully qualified knight...
 Or maybe you're just not suited to becoming an Outrider...
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: But... I just can't think of what else I could do...
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Every time I've looked forward to passing the exam, I always ended up disappointed in the end...
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Whenever I remember that feeling of disappointment, I stop being able to think about what kind of knight I could become...
 You could become an Acting Grand Master, like Jean.
(Go to Branch 1)
 You could become a Cavalry Captain, like Kaeya.
(Go to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 You could become an Acting Grand Master, like Jean.
Noelle: M—Master Jean!? How could I ever become someone great like her?
Noelle: Master Jean is a pillar of the Knights of Favonius and a great source of inspiration to me... If I could gain even one or two of her qualities, I would be very happy.
Noelle: But the thought of becoming a knight just like her in every way... I could never achieve that.
 Just set a goal first. We can start from the smaller details.
Noelle: Y—You think so? ...I suppose if the goal is set so high that I couldn't hope to achieve it right away, I won't be too disappointed day to day...
Noelle: But... where to start? I can't imagine what I would need to do to become more like Master Jean...
 Jean doesn't always sit in her office.
 Jean often helps out the locals around town.
Noelle: Oh... That's true, Master Jean is always lending a hand to citizens in need... So strong, but so gentle, too...
Noelle: I still don't think I can do what Master Jean does... But at least I could start by trying to be gentle like her.
Noelle: Okay, then let's head back to Mondstadt and see if anyone needs help.
(Proceed to Substitute Acting Grand Master Noelle)

Branch 2[]

 You could become a Cavalry Captain, like Kaeya.
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: C—Captain Kaeya? No, I could never manage that...
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Captain Kaeya has his own way of thinking and planning... Sometimes, I can barely understand it, and as for imitating it...
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: I simply wouldn't know where to begin.
 Kaeya doesn't spend every second of every day on making big plans.
 You can start with some smaller details.
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Oh, so you mean I should focus on smaller steps in order to achieve a larger goal?
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: I suppose with smaller goals, I won't be disappointed day-to-day... Since the larger goal is so light, I couldn't hope to achieve it immediately.
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: In which case... Hmmm... Captain Kaeya seems to be in the habit of fishing for information at the Angel's Share.
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: That's pretty small... and yet... I heard that the reason we were able to arrest those Treasure Hoarders last time was thanks to Captain Kaeya's intel.
 Then let's start with the Angel's Share.
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: Alright... I hope I can find some intel that proves useful to Mondstadt...

Attempted Persuasion[]

(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Dori, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19072 dori 01.ogg Dori: (That's another deal in the bag. Hehe. Mora, my beautiful Mora...)
(Approach Dori)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 dori 01.ogg Dori: Ohoho, now here are some unexpected guests. What brings you to the Palace of Alcazarzaray?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 dori 02.ogg Dori: When I saw Kaveh, I almost thought it must be that time of month again. Sadly for me, I must wait a few more days before I can collect my shiny Mora...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Hey, can't you think of something else for a change? You are literally living in an objet d'art, and yet your mind is still fixated on nothing but Mora?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: What is the point of wealth, anyway? Is your happiness entirely dependent on your hoard of cold, emotionless Mora?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 dori 03.ogg Dori: That's exactly right! Mora is extremely valuable, you see. If you don't keep your mind on it, your Mora may just find its way to somebody else's pockets!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 dori 04.ogg Dori: If you ask me, this place is still way too empty. Just give me some time, and I'll fill it to the brim with lots and lots of Mora!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: You're hopeless...
 Let's get back to why we're here.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 dori 05.ogg Dori: Ooh? So you have an actual reason to visit me? Alright, let's hear it.
 We would like to ask for your help in introducing us to some merchants.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 dori 06.ogg Dori: Merchants? Why? Is there some kind of business opportunity?
You describe the library construction project to Dori...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 dori 07.ogg Dori: Oh, I see. So you're just looking for someone to help you foot the bill...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Ugh, I knew you wouldn't be interested in something like this. Still, you wouldn't refuse just making some introductions for us, would you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 dori 08.ogg Dori: Sure, I can connect you with some folks. But with every service comes a fee, you know!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: A fee? You mean just for introductions!?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 dori 09.ogg Dori: Of course! Making introductions means using my connections and putting my reputation on the line. Why wouldn't I charge a fee for something so important!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 dori 10.ogg Dori: Since we've known each other for so long, though, I'll give you a huge returning customer discount. Hmm... how about five hundred thousand Mora?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Five hundred thousand... *sigh* I guess that's okay. But why are you charging a fee before we've even secured any funding? That just doesn't seem right.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Besides, by helping us out, you'd be doing a great service to the public! Can't you take your mind off your Mora even for just one second, and focus on something far more important?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 dori 11.ogg Dori: ...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 dori 12.ogg Dori: *sigh* Very well. Since you're so passionate about this project, I'll help you out and waive the introduction fees.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 dori 13.ogg Dori: Three of my business partners came by earlier today to discuss some things with me, and they still haven't left yet. I'll arrange a meeting for you. Just so we're clear, it'll be up to you to present your project and discuss any deals!
 Thank you.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: Th—Thank you so much.
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907201 dori 14.ogg Dori: You can wait here. I'll bring them over to you.

(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Tippu, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19072 tippu 01.ogg Tippu: (Hmph... I should have paid more attention during the negotiations just now. I could have made so much more...)
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Rubab, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19072 rubab 01.ogg Rubab: (They are Dori's associates, so...)
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Qasimi, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19072 qasimi 01.ogg Qasimi: (What do these people want?)
(Approach the group)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 tippu 01.ogg Tippu: Dori gave us a brief introduction about the two of you. You are Kaveh, the renowned architect. And you are the Traveler, practically all of Teyvat has heard of you by now.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 tippu 02.ogg Tippu: To be frank, I don't feel like there's an obvious business opportunity here. But, since Dori took the time to introduce you, we can spend some time to have a conversation. So, let's hear your idea.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Alright, here's the situation. I've been commissioned to build a library in the desert, with the intended goal of allowing the desert-dwellers to have more access to reading materials.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 rubab 01.ogg Rubab: So it's a public welfare project?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Correct.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 qasimi 01.ogg Qasimi: Hmm, then the commission fees will likely be very low. You should be careful.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: I'm not too concerned about how much I'll get for the commission fees, actually. I'm fine with doing it for free. I just want to get this project rolling as soon as possible... we're just a little short on funding.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 tippu 03.ogg Tippu: So what? You can't possibly expect that we'd just cover the shortfall for you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 tippu 04.ogg Tippu: Besides, what does a library in the desert have to do with us? If you want to build it, build it yourself with your own Mora. Seems simple enough to me...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 rubab 02.ogg Rubab: Hey, there's no need to be so harsh. They are Dori's associates, after all. Here, can you tell us a bit more about what we can gain from sponsoring this project?
 You can get the naming rights to the library.
 You can get Kaveh's client to advertise your businesses in the desert.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 rubab 03.ogg Rubab: Hmm... So we'd mostly be doing it for reputation and exposure? There is some value to that — it could make doing business in the desert a bit easier.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 tippu 05.ogg Tippu: Well, just speaking for myself, I've got nothing in the desert.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 qasimi 02.ogg Qasimi: I also have a concern... It feels like there's not much to profit from in the short term, but in the long term, the reputation gain also doesn't sound like it'd offset the cost of the sponsorship.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Then how about this: what if instead of building a single library, we commit to an entire complex of buildings dedicated to culture and education?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 tippu 06.ogg Tippu: Wouldn't that just cost more?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 rubab 04.ogg Rubab: Yes, but in that case... Mr. Kaveh, please tell us what you have in mind.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: I'll just give an example. If we were to build a library and a school near Aaru Village, then the desert dwellers would gradually begin to migrate towards the area.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: A whole suite of buildings will be able to host more traffic, and thus drive the economic development of the entire area. In turn, that would lead to direct business opportunities.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: I've been to the desert several times. Although there are still many lingering tensions between the two regions, the amount of interaction has been steadily increasing, and in the long term, the desert will only become more and more important to Sumeru.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 rubab 05.ogg Rubab: Hmm, you do have a point.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 qasimi 03.ogg Qasimi: Education in the desert is indeed an industry that has not been tapped into. If we can be the first to place stakes in the area...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 tippu 07.ogg Tippu: Hmph, and you'd just believe anything he tells you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: Even the greenest amateurs know that urban planning will affect population flow. If you don't believe me, you can ask anyone on the street to confirm it to you.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 tippu 08.ogg Tippu: You...
 You don't seem to think about your questions very thoroughly before speaking.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: Hey, why are you starting to sound like Alhaitham?
 Please only ask questions that are relevant to the discussion.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 rubab 06.ogg Rubab: Wait, something just occurred to me. If we're going to build a library in the desert, Aaru Village would obviously be the best place for it...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 rubab 07.ogg Rubab: But it seems we're not the only ones with our eyes on the village. I heard a rumor a while back saying a lot of land and buildings in Aaru Village have already been secretly purchased by a big name merchant.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 qasimi 04.ogg Qasimi: What?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: What?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 rubab 08.ogg Rubab: In other words... if we try to join the fray now, there won't be much left for us.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 rubab 09.ogg Rubab: If we want to build a suite of buildings focused on education and culture, Aaru Village is the prime location. If we want to build it anywhere else, we'll have to deal with a far larger list of problems. It's not impossible, I suppose, but...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 qasimi 05.ogg Qasimi: Then there's no hurry. We can wait for Aaru Village to develop more first, and get into the market for expansion to other areas.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: Uh... But if you were to do that...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 tippu 09.ogg Tippu: Is there nothing else to discuss? Great timing — I've pretty much heard all I want to hear. If there are no other urgent matters, I'll be on my way.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 qasimi 06.ogg Qasimi: I'll be off as well. If you have any new ideas, please feel free to reach out.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 rubab 10.ogg Rubab: It seems like the others are not interested in funding this, so no point in me doing this on my own. Let's revisit this another time.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: Hey, guys—wait! ...Ugh.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: Well, what can I say... I guess it went somewhat as expected. They are Dori's friends, after all. As soon as they heard that there's not much Mora in this for them, they lost all interest.
 That's just business, I guess.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: Yeah, it's just another day doing business with people, but I can never get used to that... Those people never think of anyone other than themselves.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: Looks like we'll have to figure out some other way to get the funding... let's go.

Media:vo kvcop001 1907202 dori 01.ogg Dori: How did the meeting go? Want to talk about it?

The Shrewd Lady of the Grand Narukami Shrine[]

(Go to the Grand Narukami Shrine)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ooh! If we're going to the Grand Narukami Shrine, are you planning to recruit Miko for your play? She'd be really good at acting!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hehe, well I guess you'll have to wait and see.
(Talk to Kano Nana)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: Heizou, what are you doing here, you little brat? Oh, and the Traveler, too. So I assume you're here to see Lady Yae?
 I honestly don't know who we're here to see.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hehe, hey c'mon cuz, maybe I'm just here to see you.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 kanonana 02.ogg Kano Nana: Hmph, don't play your little games with me. If the Traveler isn't looking for Lady Yae, then you must be here looking for Etsu, right?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You still know me best, cuz.
 Etsu?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 kanonana 03.ogg Kano Nana: Please wait here, I'll go get her.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ah, so we're not here to see Miko... bummer.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I'm flattered, but even if I wanted to, do you really think I could convince Lady Yae to join a little event like mine?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 paimon 03a.ogg Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: Get (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) to ask her next time, (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍) can do it!
After waiting a little while, a young woman approaches.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 etsu 01.ogg Etsu: Well hello, Detective Heizou. It's been so long since you last came to see me. You know, it's cruel to keep a girl waiting.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hey, community service isn't all bad, is it? I'm sure it's better than prison, at least.
 Prison?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 etsu 02.ogg Etsu: That's right. I was careless and found myself caught up in a case of fraud. Detective Heizou arrested me and I was sentenced to prison.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: For the record, I'm not the one who technically arrested you.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 etsu 03.ogg Etsu: Oh, come now, Detective Heizou. Don't pretend like you don't remember the part you played. You have a cold heart, Detective... colder than an icicle in the middle of winter.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 etsu 04.ogg Etsu: How would those Doushin have nabbed me if you hadn't provided evidence of my involvement and whereabouts, hmm? They were so bland and functional... not like you, Detective. When you took me down, you knew exactly what you were doing.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: So uh, how did you end up here at the shrine?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 etsu 05.ogg Etsu: I'm here doing community service, of course. After all the information Detective Heizou managed to squeeze out of me, he promised to help secure a reduced sentence from the court.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 etsu 06.ogg Etsu: But in the end, they hardly reduced my sentence at all. Even after serving a lengthy prison term, I am still required to perform community service. I have to spend the entire day sweeping leaves or wiping floors. Just look at what the work has done to my soft and delicate hands... *sigh*
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 etsu 07.ogg Etsu: So, don't believe a word that comes out of his mouth.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I helped you get community service because you were credited with assisting in the investigation. But, if you find it too exhausting, I can always send you back to prison again, if you want...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 etsu 08.ogg Etsu: Oh c'mon Detective Heizou, now you're just toying with me.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Don't give me that. Listen, I'd like to invite you to the anti-fraud event I mentioned last time. It's tomorrow night and you'll be a VIP guest. Let's see, appearing at the event would be equivalent to... what? Five days of community service? How does that sound?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 etsu 09.ogg Etsu: Only five days? That's hardly anything.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Five days not enough? Okay, how about four days?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 etsu 10.ogg Etsu: Hey, that's a day less than what you just promised me, Detective Heizou...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Oh, my mistake. Three days.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 etsu 11.ogg Etsu: Ugh, alright! I'll go! Just stop playing with my heart.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 etsu 12.ogg Etsu: And may I ask, will they also be coming as a guest tomorrow night?
 Ahem, hi, I'm (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 etsu 13.ogg Etsu: No wonder you're treating me so coldly today, Detective Heizou. Looks like you've found someone else to keep you company. And what a charmer they are... I get what you see in them, I mean, you'd have to be blind not to.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Etsu, now's not the time. If I hear you talking like that to my friend again, I'll make your community service even more unpleasant than your time in prison.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 etsu 14.ogg Etsu: Oh, I'm so sorry. I had no idea they were your friend, really.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 heizou 12.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Well, now you do. Just be sure you're ready tomorrow. I'll send you the location, time of the event, and the script, so don't be late.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905701 heizou 13.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Alright, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), on to our next candidate. He should be in town right about now.
(Talk to Etsu again)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 etsu 01.ogg Etsu: I apologize for earlier, I don't know what came over me.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 etsu 02.ogg Etsu: Oh, Detective Heizou? He can't stand people like me, I'm sure of it.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 etsu 03.ogg Etsu: Although he sounds polite and friendly, I can tell that he treats inmates convicted of fraud differently... He's really got something against us.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 etsu 04.ogg Etsu: Do you think he may have been defrauded himself before? Impossible, who could ever be cunning enough to fool Detective Heizou like that, hmm?
(Talk to Kano Nana again)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: Hello there, Traveler. I must apologize for my cousin — he must have been causing you all kinds of trouble? He's always been quite a handful... but I promise he doesn't mean any harm.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 kanonana 02.ogg Kano Nana: If he goes too far, please by all means put him in his place. And if he dares protest, just tell him he either does as he's told or he'll have me to answer to.

The Cunning One of Inazuma[]

(Look for the next performer in the city)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Mr. Iba, how are you doing?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 iba 01.ogg Iba: Oh, well if it isn't Heizou! Thanks to you, I haven't kicked the bucket yet.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Well, it's good to see you're alive... and well.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 iba 02.ogg Iba: Alright, out with it, I know you wouldn't come see me for nothin'.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I see you're still sharp as ever, Mr. Iba. Look, have you had a chance to think about that anti-fraud event I mentioned to you last time?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 iba 03.ogg Iba: You can forget it. I'm pushing seventy-one this year! You think I want to make a fool of myself?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Are you sure? You know, this event is very well-funded. And now that the Sakoku Decree has been repealed, I heard that your granddaughter Kazumi wants to take the chance to travel.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: If you participate, she can go without worrying about money at all.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 iba 04.ogg Iba: Huh? H—How did you know? Sure, I paid a hefty fine at the time, but I can still afford her travels.
 A hefty fine?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 iba 05.ogg Iba: You're Heizou's colleague, aren't you? How haven't you heard about this?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Well, it just so happens that Mr. Iba was a well-known figure in Inazuma back in the day. His Iba Trading Guild was even bigger than the current International Trade Association.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 iba 06.ogg Iba: Don't bring it up again. If I hadn't been misled by that foreign merchant, I never would have become a commercial scammer.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 iba 07.ogg Iba: Fortunately, young Heizou here has some respect for the elderly and applied for a probationary sentence. Otherwise, I don't think I would have ever seen the light of day again.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Well, if Heizou was so good to you, then you should help him out too, hehe.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 iba 08.ogg Iba: Hah, he's not as innocent as he looks, you know. He just knows it's easier to get information if we're chatting outside. Ask him if you don't believe me.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Those are some pretty harsh words, Mr. Iba.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 iba 09.ogg Iba: Anyway, I can't help you with that, uh... event or whatever you call it.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Argh, man alive, what should I do now? I already told Kazumi that you'd show up and caution everybody about avoiding fraud!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I'm sure it'd be beneficial for everyone, and Kazumi even agreed to come and listen! How can I explain to her that you were too worried about being embarrassed?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: She might even think that you feel no remorse at all!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 iba 10.ogg Iba: You... you imbecile! You should've told me about this first.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Come on now, how could I have known that you'd refuse to participate?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 iba 11.ogg Iba: Why you... Ugh, you sure are a crafty one, just like your father!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 12.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So, you'll join us?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 iba 12.ogg Iba: What choice do I have! Hmph, using my granddaughter to force me into some event... People these days!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 13.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Hehe, the world needs you to step up. I will send the time and place of the event, as well as the script, so don't forget to prepare.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 iba 13.ogg Iba: Alright, alright, very well.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 14.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Well then, now we only need to find the last person to play the role of the fooled victim.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 15.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: We don't want someone too clever for this role, otherwise, they'd see right through the ruse and the drama would come to a grinding halt.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmm... not too clever... Oh! Paimon knows the perfect candidate!
 Arataki "Numero Uno" Itto!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 16.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Oh yeah, I know that guy. I've seen him in the Police Station a handful of times, though I've never actually spoken to him before... Do you know where we can find him?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Well, we did just see a file called "The Prince of Mischief in Hanamizaka"... that's gotta be Itto! He must be in Hanamizaka.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 17.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Alright then. To Hanamizaka we go.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905702 heizou 18.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Oh, but knowing his reputation, I'll need to bring a little somethin' along just to guarantee we can secure his participation. You go ahead, I'll catch up.
(Talk to Iba again)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 iba 01.ogg Iba: Getting on the wrong side of Heizou really was a mistake...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 iba 02.ogg Iba: Eh? You two want to know what happened? There's not much to it, really.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 iba 03.ogg Iba: As soon as I heard that Heizou was on the case, I knew it was over. I took the easy way out and confessed to everything. After all, what else can you do when a "Cyclone" is heading your way?
 "Cyclone"?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 iba 04.ogg Iba: Heizou's nickname. It's what all the prisoners call him, haven't you heard it before?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 iba 05.ogg Iba: There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide... For criminals, Heizou is a force of nature nobody can contend with.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 iba 06.ogg Iba: Alas, if only I'd known...

"The Prince of Mischief in Hanamizaka"[]

(Look for Itto near Hanamizaka)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: How about that, kiddo? My little Prince of Mischief's got some moves, huh!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 02.ogg Arataki Itto: Guess that means your Onikabuto... is now my Onikabuto! Hahahahaha!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Itto! What are you up to?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 03.ogg Arataki Itto: Huh? Paimon, and my compadre! This is a nice surprise, what brings you out this way?
 We heard you were bullying kids.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 04.ogg Arataki Itto: What? N—No it's not... it's nothing. They let me look after their Onikabuto, just for a little while, for safekeeping. And then y'know, once they've gotten stronger, they can come and take 'em right back!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 yuugo 01.ogg Yuugo: *sob* You win some... you lose some... *sob*
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 05.ogg Arataki Itto: That's right, my little guy! Good attitude! Alright, see you 'round, okay, yeah, bye!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: There's just no helping this guy.
 Actually, we'd like to invite you to an anti-fraud event tomorrow night.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 06.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh? An anti-fraud event? I'll level with you, compadre — I have no idea what that is, but if you want me there, I can think of nowhere I'd rather be...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 07.ogg Arataki Itto: ...Oh, except that there's this Onikabuto Battle Royale tomorrow night I was planning on going to... Yeah, it's gonna be huge. No-holds-barred, winner takes home all the Onikabuto.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 08.ogg Arataki Itto: And as you can see, my Prince of Mischief has a pretty good chance of winning this thing, so... argh, if it was any other day, you know...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Do you think all of those Onikabuto together would be a match for my one? Here's a picture, let me know what you think.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 09.ogg Arataki Itto: Huh!? Wha...!? Oh-ho...!!!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 10.ogg Arataki Itto: What is this? How'd it get so big? What are you feeding this thing? Look at those beautiful demon-stripes... those razor-sharp horns... Is this the fabled Emperor Onikabuto?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: This is a small token we provide for VIPs. If you're willing to attend, then one of these will be yours at the end of the event.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 11.ogg Arataki Itto: Whoa...!? Okay, I'm there! Hahaha!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 12.ogg Arataki Itto: Wait a sec... you look familiar, who are you, anyway?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 13.ogg Arataki Itto: And furthermore, do Onikabuto really come in this size? You're not trying to con me, are you?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 14.ogg Arataki Itto: Because the more I think about it... the more I'm inclined to think that... you're a contestant in tomorrow night's Onikabuto Battle Royale!!!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 15.ogg Arataki Itto: You lost to me in a previous beetle-battle, and now you're trying to get the reigning champion out of the way. Without Prince of Mischief to contend with, you'll be free to sweep in and take all the Onikabuto!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 16.ogg Arataki Itto: Am I right, or am I right? Nice try, you little punk! Ten outta ten for the pitch, but you picked the wrooong victim!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Okay, okay... Then again, consider this: If your "Prince of Mischief" isn't competing, what's the point of me taking part? After all, all I'd stand to win is a bunch of puny little larvae, no?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 17.ogg Arataki Itto: Well... Huh, you've stumped me there... Yep, you're completely right! I can't believe I didn't think of that, hahahahaha!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 18.ogg Arataki Itto: Sorry my bro, my main man, my buddy... I had you all wrong.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: So... you're sure this guy's our best choice?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yeah! See, he was already wondering if you were trying to con him...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Then allow me to introduce myself. I'm Shikanoin Heizou, I've seen you around a few times before at the Police Station.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 19.ogg Arataki Itto: Huh? Oh, yeah! I remember now, no wonder you looked so familiar. You were that guy who was in for stealing other people's Onikabuto, right?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 20.ogg Arataki Itto: Listen, Heizou, hombre, did you apologize to them? You can lose like a man, you can win like a man, but you can never steal like a man! And that's a little Itto nugget.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Itto! He works there, for crying out loud! He's not one of your fellow inmates!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 21.ogg Arataki Itto: What!? Oh, geez, what's wrong with me, how could I forget... of course I know you. I remember you now, for real this time.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 22.ogg Arataki Itto: You're the guy who sells Lavender Melons at the station, aren't you!?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: A Lavender Melon seller? At the Police Station? Don't be ridiculous!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 23.ogg Arataki Itto: I know what I saw, okay. Several times now, I've been sitting there, starving in jail, when this guy comes and slips me a few Lavender Melons on the sly. Didn't even want payment. Solid guy!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Yeah, that was me, but it was only because your assistant, Kuki Shinobu, asked me to look out for you...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 24.ogg Arataki Itto: What? So Shinobu was behind it... Wait, so hombre, you're... not a Lavender Melon seller?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Look, we're getting hung up on all the wrong details here. The important detail right now is that I am the host of tomorrow night's event.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: And if you show up, the Onikabuto in the picture is yours. Deal?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 25.ogg Arataki Itto: Deal! Done! But uh... could I get another look at that picture first? Just a little peeksy...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You'll have all the time in the world to inspect the real article once the event's over.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 26.ogg Arataki Itto: ...Okay, sure! I can wait. So, hombre, is there anything I need to do to prepare?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 27.ogg Arataki Itto: 'Cause if I'm doing this, I'm bringing my A-game, alright! No half-measures here! I'm gonna do this right!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: He sure picks his moments to start acting responsibly...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Okay, so, for this event, you, my uh... bro, will be participating in a short anti-fraud play along with two other VIP attendees.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The main thing we ask is that you just relax, try not to be nervous. I have the script right here, if you want to take a—
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 28.ogg Arataki Itto: Script? Hahahaha! Sounds like someone's never seen the Arataki Gang perform before, huh?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 29.ogg Arataki Itto: Don't you worry, hombre, the Arataki Gang is a little beyond the need for scripts! You'll see, this Onikabuto will be well worth your investment.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 heizou 12.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: You don't need a script? Wow, well, now I'm excited. See you there tomorrow night.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905703 itto 30.ogg Arataki Itto: You bet, I'll be there! I'm gonna tell the gang about this, too, they'll all be there to support us.

The Curtain Rises[]

(Wait until the following day (20:00–24:00))
(Go to the event venue)
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It's almost time, everyone ready? Alright, then let's get this show started.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 etsu 01.ogg Etsu: Oh, I can't wait, Mr. Heizou.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 iba 07.ogg Iba: Let's get going, Heizou.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Emperor Onikabuto, hang in there, Your Highness, I'm coming for ya!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: It takes years to make a fortune, but only a moment to lose it all to a scam artist! Welcome to the first "Heizou Talks Fraud," I am your eponymous host, Heizou.
Audience: *applause*
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Okay! I'm delighted to have you all here today to explore the topic of fraud.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: To help everyone avoid becoming the victim of scam artists themselves, we thought we'd invite several VIPs with a lot of experience in this area to perform a little play with an anti-fraud message.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Please join me in welcoming to the stage...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Miss Etsu!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Mr. Iba!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: And the venerable gentleman, Mr. Arataki Itto!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Without further ado, let the show begin!
The music starts, and the actors take to the stage. Heizou narrates from the side.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: *clears throat* ...It was just another bright, sunny day when a distressed Miss Etsu brought her elderly grandpa, Iba, into the Police Station to report a crime. There, they were greeted by a kindly Doushin, surname Arataki.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 etsu 02.ogg Etsu: Doushin Arataki, please help us! My poor grandpa has been defrauded!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 itto 02.ogg Arataki Itto: Doushin... Arataki? You talking to me?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Ahem... Perhaps for want of familiarity with the script, a confused look creeps over Doushin Arataki's face, and he asks himself that age-old question: "Who am I?"
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 etsu 03.ogg Etsu: Yes, you are Doushin Arataki! You're Doushin Arataki!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 itto 03.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh, so I'm... in the play, right! Got it, I'm a Doushin, of course! Okay, I got this.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 itto 04.ogg Arataki Itto: *clears throat*... Ma'am, can you tell who it was that defrauded your grandfather? Rest assured, the Tenryou Commission and I are here to bring them to justice.

Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 heizou 21.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: All he needs to do now is release the check, and it will fall into Miss Etsu's eager hands... but let go of the check he does not!

Itto opens the box that Heizou handed to him.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 itto 68.ogg Arataki Itto: Wait... Why can't it move?
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 heizou 50.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: That's just it... I'm sorry to say, it's just a figurine.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 itto 69.ogg Arataki Itto: What? A figure!? You mean... it's a fake!!!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 heizou 51.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Yeah, and it's all my fault. I was duped by the Onikabuto vendor's false advertising. What a colossal fool I am! Taken in by a common street vendor! Argh!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 itto 70.ogg Arataki Itto: So you really were conned! Dude... Let me take a second to let that sink in...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 itto 71.ogg Arataki Itto: Gotta say, although I didn't get my Emperor Onikabuto, somehow, knowing that even Heizou got conned kinda puts me back in a good mood... it's strange...
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 itto 72.ogg Arataki Itto: Maybe I'm sharper than I'm giving myself credit for! Great minds think alike, so uh, me and my hombre here — kinda equally matched! Hehehehe, hahahahahaha!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 itto 73.ogg Arataki Itto: By the way, compadre, it looks like you're the only one out of the three of us who didn't get conned today.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 itto 74.ogg Arataki Itto: But you'd better watch out. We got fooled, not because we were stupid, but because those scam artists are some crafty dastards!
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 itto 75.ogg Arataki Itto: I want you to have this figurine, as a reminder of the fact that today, Heizou and I both got conned, but we both grew a little wiser, too.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 itto 76.ogg Arataki Itto: I hope that whenever you see it, you'll remember how cunning those con artists were, and how difficult it was for Heizou and I to see through their schemes. Then, you'll always keep your wits about you, and you'll never become a victim yourself.
Media:vo lyycop001 1905704 heizou 52.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Yeap, that's right! No one'll ever manage to con you!

 Quest DescriptionBeidou invites you to experience the boat handling training conducted by The Spear of the Crux...
Training: The Spear of The Crux[]

Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: These are some older Skirmish Boats that we keep on The Alcor as backup.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: Although they've been made redundant by newer models now, they're still fully kitted out.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: They are perfect for when we need to do simulated battles as part of crew training.
 I thought I'd be steering The Alcor in a battle simulation.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: Hahaha, disappointed? So this isn't quite on the scale that you had in mind, huh?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: To be honest, The Alcor going into battle is the last thing I'd ever want to see.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: In fact, out of all the confrontations we've ever had, almost all were resolved by negotiation.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: Only when negotiations fail do we consider deploying our armed fighters and Skirmish Boats, and they alone are enough to handle most situations.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: The only reason The Alcor would ever need to open fire would be if it were a fight to the death.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: The Alcor serves only two purposes, to deter or to destroy.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: We are an armed fleet with a strong sense of justice, not war-hungry lunatics.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_11.ogg Beidou: We are very careful about determining when to use force and exactly what level of force to use.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_12.ogg Beidou: All of this is to say that mastering a small attack craft is quite enough for new crew members.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_13.ogg Beidou: Do you have any experience piloting small armed vessels?
 Sure do, I can even sail and fire at the same time.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_14.ogg Beidou: You mean you can do the jobs of a helmsman and a gunner simultaneously...? That's quite an achievement.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_15.ogg Beidou: Even in The Crux, there are few who can do that.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_16.ogg Beidou: Seems like you're a natural.
 Of course, I can even navigate a ship right through a whirlpool.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_17.ogg Beidou: Hahahaha, you're the first person I've ever met who is so dismissive of the power of the sea.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_18.ogg Beidou: But I guess to put it another way, you're already a seasoned veteran, huh?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_19.ogg Beidou: In that case, I will skip the basics on how to operate your craft.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_20.ogg Beidou: The goal of this exercise is simple: Steer your Skirmish Boat along the prescribed route and return here within the time limit.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905201_beidou_21.ogg Beidou: You can start when you're ready. I'll be waiting here, so I can observe your skills.
(If you talk to Beidou before starting the challenge)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905202_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: Start whenever you're ready. Don't keep me waiting too long — show me how it's done.
(Go to the Skirmisher Boats)

Doing Ok in the Challenge[]

(Talk to Beidou)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905202_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: Hah, not so on form today, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), huh?
 Yeah, I'm a little rusty.
 I fazed out a little.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905202_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: I'm sure the boat is partly to blame. It's a pretty old craft, so it can be a little sluggish to operate.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905202_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: So, don't worry about it. Just remind me to have Juza make some improvements to it when we get back.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905202_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: Anyway, that was all just to get you warmed up...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905202_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: What I really want to show you is the more serious side of The Crux's business.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905202_beidou_11.ogg Beidou: Come with me. We're going to Liyue Harbor.
(You lose one heart)

Completing the Challenge Perfectly[]

(Talk to Beidou)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905202_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: Nicely done! (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), that was a joy to watch.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905202_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: Perfect timing on the turns, and you kept your craft stable on the straightaway. It was like watching a well-rehearsed show.
 I'd call that pretty routine.
 I've had a lot of training in sailing.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905202_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: Hahaha. Alright — it's high time I introduced you to some of the more serious business that The Crux takes on.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905202_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: Come with me. We're going to Liyue Harbor.
(You gain one heart)

The Crux of Our Duties[]

(Meet Beidou in Liyue Harbor)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905203_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: You may be aware that as an armed fleet, The Crux is kinda like the maritime equivalent of a Guard for Hire.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905203_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: We work as an armed carrier, earning our keep by successfully delivering the goods entrusted to us from A to B.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905203_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: Aside from that though, there is also one other important way we make income...
 Bounties for capturing pirates on the Ministry of Civil Affairs' wanted list?
 Consultancy fees for running fast-track training courses for other crews?
 Remuneration for completing Adventurers' Guild commissions?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905203_moragrubber_01.ogg Mora-Grubber: Actually, it's trading. In certain kinds of goods.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905203_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: Hey! My hotshot accountant! Nice of you to join us.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905203_moragrubber_02.ogg Mora-Grubber: Cut it out, boss.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905203_moragrubber_03.ogg Mora-Grubber: Juza sent me here with a message. He says preparations are now underway. If you give me the all-clear, I'll head straight over.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905203_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: Okay. Be careful.
 What's your bookkeeper doing here?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905203_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: Well... She has something to take care of.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905203_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: Mora-Grubber was right though. The other important side to our business — the less official side — is doing exactly what merchants do.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905203_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: Importing here, exporting there. The only difference between us and regular merchants is that our transactions aren't entirely above-board.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905203_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: You'll see what I mean by that shortly. I'm taking you to see one such transaction for yourself.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905203_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: Come on, let's go meet our trading partner for the day.
(Talk to Nei)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905213_nei_01.ogg Nei: Fresh seafood! Fresh seafood! Catch it while you can!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905204_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: What do you have?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905204_nei_02.ogg Nei: Hello there! Here at Nei's Professional Fishmonger's, we got everything you could ask for.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905204_nei_03.ogg Nei: So what do you need?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905204_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: I want a bass head with all the teeth removed. If there's a single tooth in there, I don't want it.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905204_nei_04.ogg Nei: Huh? ...You know bass have pharyngeal teeth, right? In the throat? How do you expect me to get all those out?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905204_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: Then I'll have a bass trunk with two swim bladders. Again, if it's short by one swim bladder, it's not the bass I want.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905204_nei_05.ogg Nei: You're not making this easy for me... One bass means one swim bladder. 'Fraid that's not up to me.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905204_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: Okay, then I'll take a bass tail with scales that are yellow on the outside, black on the inside. Also, it's gotta have a total of 81 scales, that's 7 times 7. No more, no less.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905204_nei_06.ogg Nei: What kind of fish scales are yellow outside and black inside? You sure this is a fish you're talking about?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905204_nei_07.ogg Nei: In any case, you can try all you want but seven times seven is never gonna get you 81...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905204_nei_08.ogg Nei: Pardon my asking but you're not a fish expert, are you? I'm sorry, Ma'am! But I'm afraid I don't have any of the things you're looking for.
 Didn't you say you have everything we could ask for?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905204_nei_09.ogg Nei: Look, I'm a professional, and so are most of the people I serve. I can accommodate anything they ask for. Seems you two are amateurs, so I'm sorry, but you'll have to go someplace else.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905204_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: Anywhere you'd recommend?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905204_nei_10.ogg Nei: Hehe, like I said, Nei's Professional Fishmonger's is for professionals. For amateurs, the place to go to would be Wai's Amateur Fishmonger's.
(Follow Beidou to Wai's Amateur Fishmonger's)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905213_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: I bet you're wondering why that guy was saying he didn't have what we wanted.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905213_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: That was just the first step in the transaction, to confirm our identity. The real deal will come later.
(Talk to Wai)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_wai_01.ogg Wai: Fresh seafood! Fresh seafood! Come take a look!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: Is this Wai's Amateur Fishmonger's?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_wai_02.ogg Wai: That's the one! We have all kinds of amateur stuff here. The more amateur, the more of it we've got!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_wai_03.ogg Wai: What would you like?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: We'd like a bass head.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_wai_04.ogg Wai: No problem! Ours are all toothless, mind you.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: And a bass trunk.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_wai_05.ogg Wai: No problem! I'll stick an extra swim bladder in there for ya, on the house.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: And a tail.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_wai_06.ogg Wai: Sure thing! I'll paint the scales yellow on the outside and black on the inside, so you can tell at a glance: This ain't no ordinary fishtail!
 Do the scales add up to 81, or seven times seven?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_wai_07.ogg Wai: If it's seven times seven you want, I can do you 81, 138, or even 648! It's up to you!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: Great! I like your style. We have a deal.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_wai_08.ogg Wai: Appreciate your patronage! Please take your order to our warehouse manager over there.
 Don't you have the fish here?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_wai_09.ogg Wai: Hehe! A real amateur if I ever met one! Proud to have you as a customer.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_wai_10.ogg Wai: No, we don't have the fish here. All fish sold at Wai's Amateur Fishmonger's are still swimming in the sea.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_wai_11.ogg Wai: Once we get the order in from the customer, we go fish it out for them. The warehouse handles that side of things.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905208_wai_12.ogg Wai: Pay first, then we bring you the goods! That way, you get the freshest catch!
(Talk to Mr. Iron Abacus)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_ironabacus_01.ogg Mr. Iron Abacus: Are you two here to collect your order? Huh? Bei... Ahem!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: Yes, Sir. We're here about that bass.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_ironabacus_02.ogg Mr. Iron Abacus: I didn't expect you to come in person. But we still need to follow procedure.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_ironabacus_03.ogg Mr. Iron Abacus: The bass you want is not a standard specimen. Our fishermen need to wait for the right moment to catch it.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_ironabacus_04.ogg Mr. Iron Abacus: You know the rules, I take it?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: Of course.
 What rules?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_ironabacus_05.ogg Mr. Iron Abacus: Hehe. As you know, timing and location are everything when it comes to fishing. You have to wait till all the conditions are just right: that means the tide, the moon, and the wind.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_ironabacus_06.ogg Mr. Iron Abacus: So let me ask you this. When will the tide come in?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: The fishing song will sound out at midnight.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_ironabacus_07.ogg Mr. Iron Abacus: How drunk will the moon be before the party's over?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: It won't stop while the star of death shines.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_ironabacus_08.ogg Mr. Iron Abacus: I see, yes... Which way will the sea breeze be blowin'?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: The breeze should be bound for Guyun.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_ironabacus_09.ogg Mr. Iron Abacus: Alright then. Well received, I will go and make arrangements. Ahem...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: Great! I think that wraps up everything we needed to do in Liyue Harbor. Let's head back and wait for the delivery.
 That's it? But where's our fish?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: Haha, I thought we were pretty clear, weren't we?
 What did all those riddles mean?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: The three people we just met are our business partners. Nei's Professional Fishmonger's and Wai's Amateur Fishmonger's are just cover names.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: The bass, obviously, is the code name for the goods. The numbers of teeth, swim bladders, and scales all represent different specifications.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: Meanwhile, the conversation I had with the warehouse keeper was the instructions for the deal itself. Lemme translate it for you...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_11.ogg Beidou: Tonight at midnight, the deal will take place in Guyun Stone Forest. The Alcor will wait there as long as needed.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_12.ogg Beidou: As for what the actual goods are, well, you'll see tonight.
 This is all so mysterious... is it as shady as it seems?
 We're not doing anything illegal here, are we?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_13.ogg Beidou: What if I were to say yes? What would you do then?
 Try and persuade Ningguang to give you a light sentence...
 Pretend I didn't see anything...
 I need to think about it...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_14.ogg Beidou: Hahahaha, thank you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). But don't worry, everything will be fine.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_15.ogg Beidou: I deeply value you as a friend, but ultimately, you're not with The Crux.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_16.ogg Beidou: I definitely don't want to cause you any trouble just because you hung out with me.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905205_beidou_17.ogg Beidou: So rest assured, we haven't broken any laws — at least not today.

A Strange Transaction[]

(Talk to Mr. Iron Abacus)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_ironabacus_01.ogg Mr. Iron Abacus: Captain Beidou. You gave me quite the surprise when you showed up in person earlier today.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_beidou_01a.ogg Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_beidou_01b.ogg Beidou: Well, my friend is visiting, so I wanted to show (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) how The Crux handles some of its important business.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_ironabacus_02.ogg Mr. Iron Abacus: I see. You two must be close.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: You got that right! Now, down to business.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: Have you brought the goods?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_ironabacus_03.ogg Mr. Iron Abacus: Yep, all here. Please, feel free to take stock.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_yijian_01.ogg Yijian: Stop! Nobody move!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_yijian_02.ogg Yijian: We have received certain information pertaining to a potential illegal business transaction at this location.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_yijian_03.ogg Yijian: Apologies, Captain Beidou, but I'm going to need to inspect those goods.
 (Oh no. Should I run for it?)
 (Oh no. Should I distract him while Beidou retreats?)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: Oh? An illegal business transaction, you say? All the goods are here. If you have any suspicions, please inspect them at your leisure.
The Millelith checks the goods.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_guian_01.ogg Gui'an: C—Captain, everything's been checked. It's just a bunch of potatoes, flour, and so on, and... all the paperwork checks out too.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_yijian_04.ogg Yijian: Huh?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_gongjun_01.ogg Gongjun: Everything's been checked thrice over... there's not a single contraband item here. The paperwork was approved by the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the tax declarations are all in order...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: Looks like you've managed to clear everything up — I suppose we can put this down as a simple misunderstanding?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_yijian_05.ogg Yijian: Yes, apologies... this was a mistake on our end.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_yijian_06.ogg Yijian: C'mon, let's go!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_ironabacus_04.ogg Mr. Iron Abacus: Bravo, Captain Beidou. This was rather ingenious.
 Wait a second. What's going on?
 All this mystery over some potatoes and flour?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_ironabacus_05.ogg Mr. Iron Abacus: Seems like your friend still has a little catching up to do.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: Hahahaha, I know you have a lot of questions, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Come on, take a walk with me, and I'll lay it all out for you.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905206_ironabacus_06.ogg Mr. Iron Abacus: I'll leave you both to it. Captain Beidou, I look forward to doing business with you again. Take care.
(Take a walk by the beach with Beidou)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905210_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: You probably thought that there was some sort of nefarious business going on behind all the secrecy today.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905210_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: The truth is, that was exactly what I wanted the Ministry of Civil Affairs to believe.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905210_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: What you might not know is that I, as the leader of The Crux fleet, and you, the great hero of Liyue Harbor...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905210_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: ...have both been on the Ministry of Civil Affairs' watch list for a long time.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905210_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: In other words, whenever you or I crop up in Liyue Harbor, it almost always draws their attention.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905210_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: Not that there's any animosity behind it, mind you. In their words, it's a security precaution to prevent people like us from causing unnecessary trouble.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905210_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: Hah, I have no qualms about that. They're just doing their job, keeping the land safe.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905210_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: But how does that saying go again? Ah yes: Sometimes, the closer you are to something, the less you can see.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905210_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: Did you figure it out yet? That's right, Mora-Grubber, the accountant.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905210_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: With you, me, and a few sacks of potatoes and flour serving as a front, the deal she's overseeing on her end should go off without a hitch.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905210_beidou_11.ogg Beidou: After all, the Ministry of Civil Affairs sent the Millelith to us.
(Talk to Beidou)
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_01.ogg Beidou: Looking at the time, it should be any second now.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_02.ogg Beidou: Look, that's the signal!
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_03.ogg Beidou: Haha, tonight's real deal is officially done.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_04.ogg Beidou: Do you have any more questions?
 I have a feeling Ningguang is not so easy to fool.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_05.ogg Beidou: You're right. Never underestimate her. But as long as we don't take things too far, she won't look into it too closely.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_06.ogg Beidou: She knows that neither you nor I would do anything to harm Liyue.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_07.ogg Beidou: In any case, there's another higher-level watch list at the Ministry of Civil Affairs above the one we're on. It's top-secret. Even I don't know whose names are on it.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_08.ogg Beidou: But I do know that the individuals and organizations on that list are the ones the Qixing are really wary of.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_09.ogg Beidou: Haha, I've gotten off-topic. On some level, Ningguang and I are actually business partners too.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_10.ogg Beidou: Reason being, I'm the only one who can get her some of the more obscure treasures she wants.
 What is the real deal?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_11.ogg Beidou: It's complicated.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_12.ogg Beidou: All you need to know is that what might be easily attainable for some people can often be a lifesaver for others who can't get their hands on it.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_13.ogg Beidou: That's where we come in. It's as simple as that.
 Do you mean... weapons?
 Do you mean... medicine?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_14.ogg Beidou: Hahahaha...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_15.ogg Beidou: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)... you still have some important things to take care of, don't you?
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_16.ogg Beidou: As long as you don't know what I was referring to, you'll be safe.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_17.ogg Beidou: So I'm sorry, but I can't tell you for now.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_18.ogg Beidou: Of course, if the day comes when you've traveled to every corner of the world, found your sibling, and neatly tied up all your loose ends along the way...
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_19.ogg Beidou: You are welcome to come back here, and I will tell you all about it.
Media:vo_bdcop001_1905207_beidou_20.ogg Beidou: You will always be welcome in the Crux Fleet. I hope I get to see you onboard again someday.

 Quest DescriptionNoelle decides to emulate Kaeya by heading to the Angel's Share and attempting to gather intel on any threats to Mondstadt's security.Noelle goes with the flow and ends up agreeing to work a shift as waitress at the tavern to help Charles out. This is not quite what the plan was, but Noelle is no quitter...
Copying the Cavalry Captain[]

Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 01.ogg Charles: Oh, it's the Honorary Knight and Noelle. Can I get you a drink? ...A non-alcoholic drink, of course.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: No need... We didn't come here to drink...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: I wanted to ask if... um, if there's been anyone... causing any trouble in the tavern lately?
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 02.ogg Charles: Troublemakers? Hmm, let me think... Actually, there was one.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Oh, really?
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 03.ogg Charles: It's that guy drinking at that table over there... Payne. He keeps ordering refills of our strongest drink, Death After Noon.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 04.ogg Charles: Look at how he's wobbling. If he passes out drunk, that could spell trouble.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Yes... that certainly sounds like a lot of trouble... although, that's not quite what I was asking about...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Umm... Is there anything in the tavern that has been... out of the ordinary lately?
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 05.ogg Charles: Out of the ordinary? Hmm, let me think.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 06.ogg Charles: Yes, as a matter of fact, there is. There are still some empty glasses on the tables upstairs that need clearing away. Must have been left there by the customers this morning.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 07.ogg Charles: But I am busy with the accounts at the moment, and if I can't find time to clear the tables before the evening crowd arrives, things could get difficult.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Really? That sounds truly terrible... Maybe I can help?
 Noelle, you're forgetting why we're here...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Oh... Sorry, I couldn't help myself...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Ahem... Mr. Charles, what I was really trying to ask was...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 08.ogg Charles: Oh, I know! You wanted to know if you could help out, right?
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 09.ogg Charles: Surely that would be asking too much... I have yet to thank you properly for helping us move those kegs last time, and here you are offering to help again... I couldn't accept your offer in good conscience...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 10.ogg Charles: Err... that being said... we are quite overwhelmed right now. So if it's all the same to you, Ma'am, would you mind serving the customers for a while?
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Umm... Umm...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: O—Okay then. It seems you are in great need of assistance...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 11.ogg Charles: Oh, thanks a million. I will leave you to serve the customers, then. Start by taking this Death After Noon to Payne, and then maybe you can clear the tables on the second floor?
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 12.ogg Charles: That should put us back on track. Okay, I should get on with the accounts, so for now I will leave the running of the tavern in your capable hands.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Wow... So this is what happens when I try to go with the flow...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: It appears that Captain Kaeya's way with words does not come the most naturally to me...
 I can't say I'm completely surprised...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: But... But waitressing in the tavern should be a good means of gathering intel, right? It's quite a common motif in the books I've read.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: I just need to keep my eyes and ears open while I'm helping Charles with the tavern duties.
(Talk to Charles again)
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 13.ogg Charles: Thanks, I'll leave the tavern in your capable hands.
(Serve the Death After Noon to Payne)
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Excuse me, Payne, here is the drink you ordered...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 01.ogg Payne: *hic* Wha— What's that? Put it to one side... I think I need to sober up...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 02.ogg Payne: This drink is strong... *hic* ...I don't feel so good...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Mr. Payne! Are you alright? Do you need to take a rest...?
 This is a tricky situation...
 How are we supposed to get any intel out of this guy?
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Hmm, let me think... If I'm not mistaken, Captain Kaeya would first get his subject drunk before asking them any questions...
 Surely he's too drunk to tell us anything by now...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: This... appears to be true... We must find another approach...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Hmm... Captain Kaeya would probably appear cordial and sincere as a means to convince his subject to lower their guard, would he not?
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: One must start by focusing on the person's individual circumstances and communicate a complete willingness to help, then slowly move the conversation in the desired direction...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Ooh, but how can I offer to help Mr. Payne right here and now...?
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: I've got it! Perhaps the dried fruits that I prepared for my exam could help him to sober up?
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Ahem... Mr. Payne, please eat this... It will make you feel better...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 03.ogg Payne: What's this...? Tastes sweet and sour...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 04.ogg Payne: Whew... I do feel slightly better now...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 05.ogg Payne: Oh, you're... Noelle, isn't it? And next to you is...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: Mr. Payne! Are you feeling any better? Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 06.ogg Payne: Next to you is... Ah, it's the Death After Noon that I ordered! Did you bring this to my table? Thanks, Noelle!
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 07.ogg Payne: Haha... *hic* This drink... is so strong...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Mr. Payne? Mr. Payne!
 Back to drunkenness again...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: How can this be...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: Drinking like this is disastrous for one's health...
 Maybe plying the customers with alcohol isn't the best approach...
 You could just listen in on their conversations instead.
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: Hmm, perhaps... Although, maybe it would be easier if there were a few more customers?
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: ...Oh, Mr. Charles also asked me to clear the tables on the second floor...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: If the second floor is filled with customers, perhaps I will have the opportunity to overhear a thing or two?
(Talk to Payne again)
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 08.ogg Payne: That was a great drink... Same again, please...
(Go to the second floor and clear the tables)
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: It's such a mess... I must clear everything away quickly so that we can serve more customers!
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: So many stains... Once the tables are clear, they will need to be washed with a good detergent...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: We're almost done! Ah, a clean and tidy environment always brightens my mood!
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 20.ogg Noelle: Phew, finally, all clear. Let's go check in with Charles.
(Talk to Charles)
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Mr. Charles, everything has been dealt with.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Is there anything else you need help with?
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 01.ogg Charles: Wow, already? Uhh... The customer at the table by the window just ordered a couple of things. Would you mind taking care of them?
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Okay, leave it all to me!
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 02.ogg Charles: Huh, with Noelle here, the tavern feels livelier than ever.
Noelle works busily at the tavern, late into the night...
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Phew... It's not easy working at a tavern.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: But... at least it's over now.
 Well done! Did you manage to gather any intel?
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Well done to you too! ...Oh. Ah... intel...
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: No! I got so caught up with working that I completely forgot we were here to gather intel.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Wh—What should I do? There are hardly any customers left that I could talk to...
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Oh, am I so incapable of handling even a simple task like this...?
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 03.ogg Charles: *sigh* Thanks for all your help today, Noelle!
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 04.ogg Charles:  I've been a bartender here for more than a decade, and I've never seen a happier crowd of drinkers than the ones who were here tonight.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 05.ogg Charles: I can only assume that with you serving the customers, the wine tasted all the sweeter.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: I'm quite sure that can't be true... I didn't do anything particularly special.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 07.ogg Charles: Customers don't come here purely for the drinks. They come for what the drink represents — some time to relax after a long day of work...
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 08.ogg Charles: Often, customers choose this tavern not just for the quality of the drinks we serve, but also for the great atmosphere.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 09.ogg Charles: You may not have brewed the wine, or even mixed the drinks... But for many customers, service with a smile is what makes the difference between a glass of wine and a great night out.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 10.ogg Charles: It seems this tavern could do with more than just a single bartender. What we need is some proper waiting staff to really take care of the customers. Perhaps I could convince the boss to hire a waitress...
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 11.ogg Charles: Anyway, I digress. Thanks again for all your help tonight!
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Wow... I am so glad to know I made everyone so happy...
 It's okay that you didn't collect any intel.
 You are looking after Mondstadt in your own way.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Yes... Even though I failed to imitate Captain Kaeya...
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: It looks like I was still able to help those in need.
 It's the same with an exam. You'll always have strengths and weaknesses.
 It's the same with an exam. Just aim to do well in the things you're good at.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: Yes... I will keep that in mind.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: Thank you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 12.ogg Charles: Ahem... Heh... Sorry to interrupt, I sense that it's probably not the best moment...
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 13.ogg Charles: However... Could I ask for one last little favor?
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 14.ogg Charles: Drinking to make merry is all well and good, but passing out drunk in my tavern... That's a pain.
 Who needs to be taken home?
 Someone passed out?
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 15.ogg Charles: *sigh* Payne ordered two more Deaths After Noon over the course of the night...

Poems Dedicated to the Wind[]

Media:vo kycop001 1909402 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Port Ormos is always lively, even late into the night. People there go to bed much later than I imagined...
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Quite a stark contrast with Mondstadt. People pray and play music in the Cathedral plaza during the day, but come nighttime, the streets are deserted except for the knights on patrol.
 Which lifestyle do you prefer?
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Good question.
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Life in Sumeru is never dull. Last time I was out drinking on the street at night, some passing mercenaries invited me to dance.
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Although, I did learn later that that kind of thing is highly unusual even there. Hahaha, they must have been in a very good mood that night.
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: They taught me a lot of songs that they usually sing during feasts. It really was a fun night... But be that as it may, I think I'm more suited to the free and easy life in Mondstadt.
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Simple, honest folks like me... we don't need much to be content.
 Can you even hear what you're saying?
 Are you serious?
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Fair enough, let's shelve that discussion for now. Have you ever had a chance to hear the Cathedral choir before? The hymns they sing are a whole tradition in their own right, quite different from the folk songs that the bards play.
 Not yet.
 It sounds very interesting.
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Well, let's see if we can catch them today. Sister Grace is right there, so we can ask her about the choir's schedule.
(Kaeya walks over to Sister Grace)
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: Excuse me, Sister Grace, does the church choir have any performances coming up soon?
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 grace 01.ogg Grace: Oh, I'm so sorry... The hymn concert we previously announced has unfortunately been pushed back.
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Oh? What's the story there?
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 grace 02.ogg Grace: As you probably know, Captain Kaeya, we've been trying to organize an amateur choir in addition to the regular church choir.
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Ah yes, I heard about that. I believe the plan was ultimately to have different choirs who can take turns to perform hymn concerts.
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 grace 03.ogg Grace: Yes, exactly. Well, it turns out there are plenty of believers who are good singers and interested in joining a choir. So in theory, it should have been a simple case of getting everyone in the same room, then practice, practice, practice...
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 grace 04.ogg Grace: But for some reason, the rehearsals are going terribly. I don't understand it. Everyone in the choir has a basic level of musical literacy, but they sound awful together. It's like everyone's trying to do their own thing — there's no group harmony.
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 grace 05.ogg Grace: Maybe I'm just not musically gifted enough to give them the guidance they need.
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 grace 06.ogg Grace: Captain Kaeya, I know you like listening to hymns... How good is your understanding of vocal music?
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: Me? Ahaha, music is far from my forte. But if you need some help, then don't worry. I know an expert who's more than up to the task.
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 grace 07.ogg Grace: Thank you so much, Captain Kaeya! Having some expert guidance will definitely be a great help.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: I'm sure you've figured out who this expert is already. He has the best singing voice of any poet in Mondstadt, and understands poetry better than any other singer.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Plus, he's exceptionally easy to find. Nine out of ten times, he's in the tavern.
(Talk to Grace again, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909402 grace 08.ogg Grace: Thank you both so much! Having some expert guidance will definitely be a great help.
(Approach the Angel's Share)
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Good day, drinking alone? I hope you don't mind us joining you.
 Hello, Venti.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 01.ogg Venti: Hello, hello! Please, take a seat, we're all friends here.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Patton, one Moonlit Alley and an Apple Cider.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 02.ogg Venti: Excellent choices. Come on, let's have a toast and drain our glasses together!
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 03.ogg Venti: Here's to the time spent drinking with friends, which is more unforgettable than the drinks are delectable.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Ever the poet, Professor Venti. A beautiful toast from the bard with the most.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Any new songs of yours we could listen to? There's a real dearth of quality entertainment at the moment, since the Cathedral's choir performance has been delayed again...
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Speaking of which, I trust you've heard Sister Grace's choir perform before?
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 04.ogg Venti: Of course! Though the format is a little on the formal side, they do sing quite beautifully. Very pleasant to listen to.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: So you'd say you enjoy hymns?
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 05.ogg Venti: Hmm... Let me think... Well, however it's expressed, as long as you can hear the singer's passion and joy in their voice, I consider it a phenomenal performance.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: "Passion" and "joy," huh? An intriguing perspective. By this logic, I suppose Lord Barbatos would also enjoy the choir's performances.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 06.ogg Venti: Oh? And why is that?
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: Think about it. It's only because of his patient guidance and protection that the people of Mondstadt can now sing such beautiful hymns in the Cathedral.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: It must be quite satisfying for him to hear a joyful people lift up their voices in song.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 07.ogg Venti: Yes, well, that's a beautiful image, filled with hope. But actually... Maybe Barbatos himself doesn't give it so much thought.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 08.ogg Venti: In principle, the hymns of the Cathedral are dedicated to a god, but in reality, the audience are all ordinary people with very worldly concerns. So what really matters is that the people enjoy what they're listening to.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: ...
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: Heh, if Sister Grace was able to see things that way, perhaps she wouldn't feel so distressed.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 09.ogg Venti: Huh? Distressed? About what?
You explain Sister Grace's predicament to Venti.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 10.ogg Venti: Ugh, she might be asking a bit too much... To be honest, if they have a natural talent for music, they should just be allowed to sing whatever they want. It'll all sound good.
 Even if they aren't singing the same tune?
 Even if their voices aren't in harmony?
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 11.ogg Venti: Uhh... I'm pretty sure the first people to sing songs to the Anemo Archon weren't all singing the same tune...
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 12.ogg Venti: Besides... he is the God of Freedom. Surely he'd prefer to hear Mondstadters sing their hearts out however comes naturally to them.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: Well, to each their own I say, but Sister Grace seems quite bothered by the whole thing. If only a kind soul with a deep understanding of poetry and music could help her... Patton!
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 patton 01.ogg Patton: More drinks?
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 13.ogg Venti: Uh-oh... I only brought enough money for one bottle today, I'll have to pass...
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: Another bottle of Apple Cider for Venti, please, Patton. My treat.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 14.ogg Venti: Wow, thanks Kaeya! Ah, you were one of the finest students ever to emerge from my fast-track love poetry class... I always did admire your enthusiasm and kindness.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 15.ogg Venti: With the aid of this bottle, a humble bard's woes are whisked away on the wind... And so it falls to this humble bard to pass the blessing on to another.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: Hehe, then this is probably the single most worthwhile alcohol purchase I've ever made. With your help, Sister Grace's problems are as good as solved.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 17.ogg Kaeya: Sister Grace is a devout follower of the Anemo Archon. Perhaps it's her depth of devotion that causes her to worry too much about the smallest things.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 16.ogg Venti: Don't worry! Just wait a moment, I'll go find her... riiiight after I finish this cider!
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 17.ogg Venti: The next time you visit her, our sweet Sister shall be sad no more!
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 kaeya 18.ogg Kaeya: Patton, the check please.
You say your farewells after enjoying some fine wine. Kaeya leaves first.
(Talk to Venti again, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 18.ogg Venti: ...Kaeya is a wily character, but free wine is always the most delicious.
 You can always refuse.
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 19.ogg Venti: Ah, it's fine. I mean, the church's choral hymns aren't exactly my strong suit, what with all the finicky formalities and so on... but as long as there is love for music in the air, I'm sure I'll be able to help.
 It sounds like it'll actually take a lot of work...
 You're not just doing it for the wine?
Media:vo kycop001 1909403 venti 20.ogg Venti: Hey, if I'm happy, and Sister Grace is happy, and the audience is happy... that's a great thing, isn't it?
The Helper[]
(Approach Venti and Sister Grace)
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Hello, Sister Grace. How are the rehearsals going?
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 grace 01.ogg Grace: Captain Kaeya, your bard friend has a few suggestions that are somewhat... fanciful in nature.
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 venti 01.ogg Venti: Fanciful in the sense of not worth adopting, is that what you mean?
 What're your thoughts, Venti?
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 venti 02.ogg Venti: Everyone in the choir loves to sing, but they're used to singing their favorite songs.
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 venti 03.ogg Venti: Suddenly asking them to sing in perfect harmony, like a church choir with years of experience, is just too difficult.
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 venti 04.ogg Venti: So why ask them to adjust to the demands of those staid old church hymns, when you could just... create a new song for them, one that they'll all be able to grasp quickly? If you want, I could help.
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Church choirs typically stick to traditional hymns... This is certainly an innovative idea.
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: What's stopping you from considering it, Sister Grace?
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 grace 02.ogg Grace: While I don't expect a recently established amateur choir to perform on par with our own church choir, this would be a major departure from tradition... I'm just not convinced that it's appropriate...
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Haha, is the Church of Favonius really such a stickler for tradition? Giving believers the chance to express themselves freely seems like it would be a very positive thing.
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: So Venti, do you think the Anemo Archon would like to hear a new melody?
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 venti 05.ogg Venti: Of course! This was the wish of the people when new Mondstadt was first founded.
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Okay, well let's see what our other friend thinks. (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), what are your thoughts?
 I, for one, am inclined to agree with Venti's understanding of Barbatos.
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Another vote of confidence. Maybe there's hope for this idea yet.
 The audience might take some time to get used to a new song...
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 venti 06.ogg Venti: That's perfectly natural. I'm sure the first hymns ever sung took some getting used to for the audience at the time as well. But I believe that as long as the song is an earnest expression of feeling, it will reach people's hearts sooner or later.
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 venti 07.ogg Venti: ...Also, let's not forget that the greatest bard in the world is gonna help write it!
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 grace 03.ogg Grace: Heh... Maybe it's just a generational thing, but... *sigh* Well, it's not a completely unreasonable idea. I suppose it can't hurt to try...
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Looks like we're all in favor, then, so let's start preparing. Sister Grace, could we trouble you to inform the choir members?
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 grace 04.ogg Grace: Of course. I'll tell them now, and then we'll give this a try.
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 venti 08.ogg Venti: Should we find some people to help us compose the lyrics? If this is to be a new song of the people, then the more fresh ideas we have, the better.
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Good idea! Let's split up and find some contributors, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
 Who should I go look for?
 What should I say to them?
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: Let me think... Since we're composing a song, we should try and recruit at least one person who understands music... Aha, I know.
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Sister Grace... How would you feel about us asking Sister Barbara to provide her input?
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 grace 05.ogg Grace: Given that the idea is to write a song dedicated to Lord Barbatos, I'm sure Sister Barbara would be very willing.
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Perfect. (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), why don't you head into the Cathedral and invite Sister Barbara to join us? I'll look for another friend who's interested in helping us.
(Talk to Venti again, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909405 venti 09.ogg Venti: Got it! With this melody, it'll be much more expressive...
(Talk to Barbara)
Media:vo kycop001 1909406 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Let the wind lead! (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), it's been a long time since I last saw you in the Cathedral.
 Barbara! Just the person I was looking for.
Media:vo kycop001 1909406 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Fortunately, I have some time to spare at the moment. What is it?
 I have a rather unusual request for you...
Media:vo kycop001 1909406 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Please, don't be shy, go right ahead!
You tell Barbara about the plan to write a brand new song.
Media:vo kycop001 1909406 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: Oh, I see! What an interesting idea.
Media:vo kycop001 1909406 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: The hymns we know today have been passed down to us through the ages. Very few people would ever think to create a new one.
Media:vo kycop001 1909406 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: But as long as we put our hearts into it, and write with reverence and devotion, perhaps our new song can become part of the tradition that is passed on, and bring joy to future generations.
Media:vo kycop001 1909406 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: I never imagined that the bard would come up with such an amazing suggestion! I'd really love to be a part of this!
 We're having a discussion in the plaza now, would you like to join?
 Do you have time to join a lyric-writing session?
Media:vo kycop001 1909406 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: Sure! Let's go there together right now.
A Poem From the Wind[]
(Approach the group in the plaza)
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Ah, you're here.
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 diona 01.ogg Diona: You took your sweet time.
 Hey, Diona.
 So Kaeya's helper is Diona, huh?
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 diona 02.ogg Diona: I've seen Kaeya play Genius Invokation TCG, making up a bunch of baloney to distract his opponents... Hmph! He's a trickster, plain and simple. So, now I gotta check with you guys to see if what he's saying is true.
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 diona 03.ogg Diona: Can we really write about anything we want in this song? Even... the evils of Mondstadt's wine industry...?
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 diona 04.ogg Diona: And is the choir really gonna perform it publicly? So everyone out on the streets will hear it?
 Do you think she can really write about that?
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: I don't think anything's off-limits. I thought it was a fun idea, anyway.
 Let's hope Diluc won't mind...
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: I can guarantee he won't.
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 diona 05.ogg Diona: Hehehe... Then I wanna write this: "All boozehounds will be punished harshly by Lord Barbatos!"
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 venti 01.ogg Venti: Achoo! That's a very novel idea indeed.
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 melker 01.ogg Melker: I'm used to just humming to myself while I work, so after Sister Grace criticized us for not singing in harmony, I was planning on quitting the choir.
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 melker 02.ogg Melker: I never thought we'd be able to just sing what we wanted! What a relief.
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 artur 01.ogg Artur: Plus, we get to write a song with Sister Barbara! I'm so honored!
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Thank you everyone! Why don't we start by picking a theme for this song?
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 grace 01.ogg Grace: I agree. Traditionally speaking, the theme should be "Praise Be to the Gentle and Loving Lord Barbatos."
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: I expect that Professor Venti might feel that topic is overdone and lacks originality, and that it may not be to Lord Barbatos's liking.
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 venti 02.ogg Venti: That's Kaeya for you, got it in one! I'd suggest that everyone start by thinking of the little things in life that bring you joy.
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 diona 06.ogg Diona: Ooh, well then can I praise the purrfect Fish Head Soup my Mom cooked last night?
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 venti 03.ogg Venti: Of course you can!
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: I think I'd like to rejoice in the precious days spent together with family.
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 artur 02.ogg Artur: Let us praise Mondstadt, the city that allows us to sing freely!
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 venti 04.ogg Venti: See, already we have lots of wonderful ideas! Haha, let's write them down, and then Kaeya can...
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 venti 05.ogg Venti: Huh? Kaeya?
(Talk to Venti, Barbara, or Diona, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 venti 06.ogg Venti: Okay everyone, write your ideas down once you've got something, and then we'll open it up for a group discussion!
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: I think the song should express the joy of being together with family.
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 diona 07.ogg Diona: Should I write about Fish Head Soup, or Liyue Grilled Fish...
(Talk to Melker, Artur, or Grace, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 melker 03.ogg Melker: Hmm, what should I sing about...
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 artur 03.ogg Artur: Home of the Windborne... What do you think of that?
Media:vo kycop001 1909408 grace 02.ogg Grace: Surely the song should at least mention Lord Barbatos...?
(Talk to Kaeya)
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: What are you doing here? Didn't want to participate in the discussions?
 You're not participating either.
 Do you want to leave?
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: I just wanted you to take you to hear a performance. But that obviously didn't happen, thanks to the problems with the choir rehearsals.
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: The rehearsals are now back on track, so I've done my part. If I stay here any longer, I'll probably get roped into singing with them.
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: I'd rather it didn't come to that. My songwriting abilities are limited.
 Here you are helping other people out, when you're supposed to be kicking back and relaxing...
 Or perhaps this is your way of relaxing?
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: If doing nothing but loitering on the plaza enjoying the scenery all day is the only way to relax, then I suppose I didn't get to relax.
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: But that would get boring after a while. To me, it's more fun to wander around, see what's happening, and insert myself into interesting situations.
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Besides... Can you be so sure I didn't have something to gain from helping Sister Grace with her choir rehearsal dilemma these past few days?
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 venti 01.ogg Venti: Oh-ho! I spy two naughty students skipping class... And they just so happen to be the very two who asked me to help Sister Grace in the first place.
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 venti 02.ogg Venti: We're ready to review and discuss everyone's lyric contributions now. Hey... why is it that you look like you're trying to run away?
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: I still recall the teachings of Professor Venti: The Anemo Archon cares not about how moving the people's songs of praise are, but rather whether or not the song comes from the heart.
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: With so many true believers gathered together earnestly writing a song for him, I'm sure the Anemo Archon is watching on and feels very satisfied.
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: That's what a song of worship is all about. So, mission accomplished.
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 venti 03.ogg Venti: And that's the reason you've decided to leave?
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Slipping away before the final verse is sung, before the poet has uttered the last line, before everything has concluded... I don't know, something about it just resonates with me.
 You just think writing poetry is too much trouble.
 You're just embarrassed to sing.
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Oh no, you've seen right through me!
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 venti 04.ogg Venti: Wow, that was a craftily crafted speech. I almost fell for it.
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 venti 05.ogg Venti: But to share all this with a group of friends, only to find myself one friend short before the final verse is sung, before the poet has uttered the last line, before everything has concluded... I don't know, something about it just irritates me.
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 venti 06.ogg Venti: If you don't want to write a poem, then let me gift you one!
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 venti 07.ogg Venti: "Abandoned to whatever fortune the cruel waters bring, bereft of control directionless I swing."
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 venti 08.ogg Venti: "The swift currents surge, and onward I urge, through the snow and frost that Fall and Winter bring."
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 venti 09.ogg Venti: "Majestic waves cresting, surf roaring its tale, none but the ocean to hear as I sing."
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 venti 10.ogg Venti: "The stars in my eyes as I chart toward the horizon, that into one day, from the endless dome of night I shall spring."
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 venti 11.ogg Venti: If you are a chaser of freedom, the Anemo Archon will bless you. So why not let those feelings out, and sing with everyone?
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: A boat that has come unmoored will not get lost in the night, but sail towards the dawn... A beautiful image.
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 venti 12.ogg Venti: Of course, you don't have to believe in it, but the winds of Mondstadt will guide every lost ship back to safe harbor.
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: Well, after a fine poem like that, it would be plain rude of me not to rejoin you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909409 venti 13.ogg Venti: Haha, let's head back together. You two of all people have to be there for the grand finale.

The Stage[]

(Talk to Nesmil, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 nesmil 02.ogg Nesmil: If you want to order any food, just holler.
(Approach the stage)
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 gundafar 01.ogg Gundafar: ...Your Majesty, not only has God bestowed the throne upon you, but your beloved son, Prince Qubad, has led our brave warriors to victory against Frasiyav's army. His men have laid down their arms and fled.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 gundafar 02.ogg Gundafar: Frasiyav's brazen ambition is no more. He has bowed his head and now presents to Your Majesty an offering of treasures and hostages, as well as a plea for peace.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 gundafar 03.ogg Gundafar: My king, this battle has finally restored the dignity of our people. Moreover, with Frasiyav's offer of land comes the opportunity to expand our borders, as Your Majesty so greatly wishes.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 gundafar 04.ogg Gundafar: His Highness the Prince and I believe this peace settlement will be a great boon to our nation. It is for this reason alone that I have removed my armor and made haste back to our halls from the front lines. My king, what say you to this proposal?
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Ah, it's the tale of Prince Qubad. Ever heard this one?
 Nope, never.
 Feels like we've missed a lot of the backstory.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Don't worry, I still remember the general plot. Let me fill you in on the background while the king deliberates.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: The main characters are the brilliant prince Qubad and his war-hungry father, King Qabus. The one talking to the king right now is Gundafar, the prince's tutor.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: When the prince was young, the king was deceived by a malicious rumor that the prince had mistreated his stepmother. He demanded that the prince walk through a blazing fire to prove his innocence.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Miraculously, the prince emerged unscathed, thus proving his innocence. But the seeds of doubt had already been sown in the king's mind.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Now uneasy in the presence of his mistrustful father, the prince requested to be sent away to the battlefield, where he would fight against Frasiyav's army — that's the enemy general we heard them mention just now.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: This is the part where the prince has won the war and decided to forge a peace with the rival nation. He wrote a letter recommending peace to his father... Oh, it looks like the king's made up his mind. Let's keep watching.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 01.ogg Qabus: Frasiyav lost because he did not have the blessing of God. Our God will always watch over us, and punish our enemies.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 02.ogg Qabus: Once the bells of war have begun to toll, they shall not cease until the blood of our enemies fills the land. There can be no victory until the last enemy soldier has fallen.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 03.ogg Qabus: If Qubad still wishes to be my son, and hold the intaglio I bestowed upon him as proof of his royal blood, then he must obey my command.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 gundafar 05.ogg Gundafar: Your Majesty, I must caution that a nation destroyed is not a fallen city writ large. Now, the loss of one city strikes fear into the hearts of our enemies, compelling them to accept defeat and cede land in exchange for peace.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 gundafar 06.ogg Gundafar: If, however, we insist on bringing a whole nation to its knees... Then so long as a single person is left standing, they will see us as their sworn enemy, and one day return to us tenfold the pain that we have inflicted on their nation and family.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 gundafar 07.ogg Gundafar: My king, a people is to their nation as wild grass to the open prairie. Though we burn down the whole field and spare not one blade of grass, roots continue to grow unseen beneath the surface. Come the spring, it is all but inevitable that fresh green shoots will rise up from the ashes.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 04.ogg Qabus: Cease, Gundafar. Your mind grows dull in your old age, filled with naive delusions. We shall have no more need of you on the battlefield.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 05.ogg Qabus: As for my son Qubad... I will summon him back to the capital, so he may be tried by a court-martial.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 gundafar 08.ogg Gundafar: What are you saying, my noble king? Why must you mistrust your own flesh and blood, and sink ever deeper into the blight of hatred?
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 gundafar 09.ogg Gundafar: When he was falsely accused, you once doubted his honor, and made him walk through a raging fire. Did he not prove himself worthy by emerging unharmed from the flames?
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 gundafar 10.ogg Gundafar: Now you would turn me away, when I seek only to provide the wisdom of counsel. What is the justification for this?
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 06.ogg Qabus: The justification is that my word, not yours, is the law of the land. Cease and begone, Gundafar, so you may spend the rest of your days with your wife.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 gundafar 11.ogg Gundafar: What has become of the king that I served with my life? Fanaticism has robbed him of all reason and wisdom... Peace is surely the most favorable path for our nation, yet he refuses to accept it.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 07.ogg Qabus: I must think of a way to seize control of the army back from the hands of my wayward son, that they might continue this fight to the end. Perhaps the first task should be this... I shall send a loyal contingent of warriors to eliminate Frasiyav and the hostages he has sent to our palace.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Brilliant acting, Darbil.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 08.ogg Darbil: Hahaha, I saw you approaching us in the middle of the scene. I was worried that my performance would be subpar, and you'd think I was just making a fool of myself.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Not at all, far from it. Actually, let me introduce you — this is Darbil, the actor for King Qabus.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: When we first got to know each other, he was still a guard for one of the merchant caravans. Seems like he's now made the switch to full-time acting.
 Hello.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 09.ogg Darbil: Nice to meet you. Any friend of Kaeya's is a friend of mine.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 10.ogg Darbil: To be perfectly honest, I wasn't making all that much as a mercenary. It felt right to me to get away from the danger and live a more stable life.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 11.ogg Darbil: I was already pretty good at telling stories, so I just recruited a few friends, and started performing shows all over the country.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 12.ogg Darbil: Full disclosure, we had to put this little stage together using whatever wood and cloth we could borrow... It's really low-budget.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 13.ogg Darbil: Anyway, we're all good enough at acting to get through the motions, but none of us are any good at coming up with a script. Everything we tried to write just sounded off somehow.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 14.ogg Darbil: So I got a student from the Akademiya to adapt an old story I knew to make it more appealing to our audience. What do you think? Passable?
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: I could tell that you've had someone tighten up the lines. They turned out very nicely.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 15.ogg Darbil: Ah, that's good... Well, as you can see, even now, we still don't have much of an audience... Don't suppose you'd be interested to see the rest of the show?
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Sure, why not. I don't have anything pressing lined up, and I don't think (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) does either.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: Tickets for two, please. How much would that be?
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 16.ogg Darbil: Hah, there's no need for tickets. You can just get some food from Djafar Tavern — we've worked out an arrangement with them.
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 17.ogg Darbil: We actually found a sponsor for this performance, too. He's not too happy about the poor turnout, though...
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 18.ogg Darbil: I doubt we'll be able to keep him for the next performance. A real pity... but what can ya do, huh?
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 gundafar 12.ogg Zabi: Darbil, Asgar still hasn't shown up for the next scene. We should get his costume and sword out, so they'll be ready to go the moment he gets here...
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 19.ogg Darbil: My apologies, I have to go get ready for the upcoming scene. I'll see you from the stage.
(Talk to Darbil again, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 qabus 21.ogg Darbil: Where in the seven nations is that little twerp? The next scene is about to begin...
(Talk to Zabi again, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 gundafar 14.ogg Zabi: God only knows. It's not the first time he's done this, either... *sigh*
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Nesmil, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 nesmil 01.ogg Nesmil: (That outlander sure is easy on the eyes...)
(Talk to Nesmil)
Media:vo kycop001 1909802 nesmil 01.ogg Nesmil: Would you two like to order some food? What can I get you? If you're looking for recommendations, today's special is the Tandoori Roast Chicken.
Media:vo kycop001 1909802 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Bear with us a moment... We're just going to take a look at the menu.
 How did you become friends with Darbil?
Media:vo kycop001 1909802 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: I was at Port Ormos discussing some business opportunities, and some crook was trying to pull a fast one on me. Darbil took pity on me, and politely asked him to make himself scarce.
Media:vo kycop001 1909802 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: He's a good guy. A decent storyteller, too. Quite an interesting character.
Media:vo kycop001 1909802 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: There's a lot of fun to be had if you hang around interesting people doing interesting things, especially if you're in the company of an interesting friend.
Media:vo kycop001 1909802 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: That's my secret formula for staying in a good mood. Try it out sometime, you'll see what I mean.
Media:vo kycop001 1909802 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Thanks for waiting. We're ready to order now.
Media:vo kycop001 1909802 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: We'll take you up on that Tandoori Roast Chicken... And let's throw in some desserts, too — one each of the Rose Custard, that Tulumba, and the Padisarah Pudding, please. That should see us through the show.
(Talk to Nesmil again, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909802 nesmil 02.ogg Nesmil: Your food's on the way. It'll just be a few more minutes.
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Kaeya, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: (There are worse ways to pass the time than watching a little outdoor theater... Too bad I already know the story.)
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: (Having (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) here will help to keep things interesting, though. And being close to where the action's happening is always exciting.)
(Talk to Kaeya)
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: We've got good seats. Close to the stage, but also not too crowded.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: We can watch the show as we eat. If I remember correctly, the next scene should focus on the prince.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: But I won't spoil it for you. You have to experience it for yourself.
 Do you like this story?
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: I don't tend to judge a story's worth by my personal affinity for it. But if you want to know my opinion, I'd say it's a fine tale, with a classical flavor that makes it a story for the ages.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: History always repeats itself. When you keep this in mind and watch out for the echoes of past events in the present, things that appear unfathomable at first glance become much easier to comprehend.
 Sounds like this story has made quite an impression on you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: You could say that. It's always stayed with me, because it's hammered home a cruel but realistic truth.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: "People do not choose where and when to be born, yet the circumstances of their birth define the choices that they will have for the rest of their life."
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 nesmil 01.ogg Nesmil: Here you are! The check's on the table too — just call me over when you're ready to settle up.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: No need — I'll pay upfront. Here. Keep the change.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 nesmil 02.ogg Nesmil: Thank you, Sir... Oh, but this is too generous...
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Call it a token of my gratitude for the excellent service. The food all smells wonderful too, so please pass my compliments to the chef.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 nesmil 03.ogg Nesmil: Thank you so much, Sir.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Let's dig in, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
You enjoy the feast with Kaeya.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 qabus 01.ogg Darbil: Hey, Kaeya... Ugh, I'm so sorry, but the actor who plays the prince has run into some difficulties, and won't be able to make it.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 qabus 02.ogg Darbil: We can't do the rest of the show without him so... I'm really, really sorry, but we'll have to call the show right here.
 It's too bad that we won't see the end of the story.
 Can Kaeya fill in for him?
 Can you use an understudy?
 Can Kaeya fill in for him?
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: Ooh, that would be fun... I wouldn't say no.
 I was just kidding.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: Darbil, would you lose any income if I were to mess this up?
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 qabus 03.ogg Darbil: Not really, I mean... there's not much of an audience here anyway. I wouldn't want to take too much of your time, though...
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: Eh, don't worry about that. I like to be spontaneous now and then, spice things up a little.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 qabus 04.ogg Darbil: Let me think... Well, you already know the story, so you'd just need to memorize a few lines... Huh, you know what? This might actually work.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 qabus 05.ogg Darbil: Ah wait, but Qubad has a specific costume he's supposed to wear, and there's no way you'd fit into it...
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 qabus 06.ogg Darbil: Switching actors is one thing, but wearing street clothes on stage would really ruin the immersion... Yeah, I don't think this is gonna work.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: Well, good thing that I've actually got a costume with me. It goes pretty well with your stage, too.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 qabus 07.ogg Darbil: You're kidding? Can you show it to me?
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 17.ogg Kaeya: Sure, if you can show me the way to your changing room?
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 qabus 08.ogg Darbil: It's in the restaurant. Follow me.
One moment later...
(Kaeya emerges wearing Sailwind Shadow)
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 18.ogg Kaeya: Gotta say, I think I actually look pretty dapper in this. It's a pity I don't have many opportunities to wear it in public.
 You're such a show-off! ...But you do look pretty good.
 I never knew you were so vain.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 19.ogg Kaeya: Uh-oh, not a fan of me as a prince? I'll have to act my heart out, so you'll be too dazzled to make any digs.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 qabus 09.ogg Darbil: Kaeya, here's your script for the next scene. It's not too long, but you also don't have very long to prepare... Do you think you can memorize your lines in time?
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 20.ogg Kaeya: Only one way to find out.
Kaeya and the actors briefly rehearse the scene.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 gundafar 01.ogg Zabi: Okay, I think we've covered all your lines and movements on stage. You haven't had long to prepare, so don't worry about forgetting your lines — we'll remind you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 kaeya 21.ogg Kaeya: Alright. I'm good to go.
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 gundafar 02.ogg Zabi: Great! Then let's get this show on the road.
All the World's a Stage[]
(Talk to Nesmil again, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909803 nesmil 04.ogg Nesmil: Just give me a shout if you need anything else.
(Approach the stage)
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 frasiyav 01.ogg Frasiyav: General Qubad, son of Qabus, the fate of this battle is clear.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 frasiyav 02.ogg Frasiyav: I beg you, please spare my few remaining men. They no longer have the strength to fight back.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 01.ogg Qubad: Frasiyav, though you now lead only the husk of a once-mighty army, I have no desire to crush your dignity.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 02.ogg Qubad: Even your most savage warriors have no desire to see further bloodshed, and none among your ranks have opposed these peace talks. Nevertheless, I must hear it from you one final time:
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 03.ogg Qubad: General Frasiyav, do you agree to sign a treaty in good faith, and commit from this day forth to peace between our nations?
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 frasiyav 03.ogg Frasiyav: With my army in ruins, I am in no position to do otherwise. But on this, I give you my word:
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 frasiyav 04.ogg Frasiyav: Yes, let us end our hostilities, and send our surviving men home to their families.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 04.ogg Qubad: We share the desire to lay down our arms for good, and liberate our hearts from the dirge of hatred.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 05.ogg Qubad: Then as God above is our witness, by the authority vested in me by this intaglio of King Qabus:
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 06.ogg Qubad: I hereby declare that I will spare your hostages, and what remains of your army. May peace be restored to this land, and may these fields of war become a place where crops grow aplenty.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 07.ogg Qubad: My tutor, Gundafar, has already made haste to my father, the King, with the recommendation of a truce. It is my sincere hope that he will see that peace is a path to prosperity, and grant me his blessing.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 frasiyav 05.ogg Frasiyav: Prince Qubad, your name is renowned throughout your land and ours. I will place my hope in your words.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 08.ogg Qubad: One will find on a battlefield no master of ceremonies, nor the paper on which a treaty may be signed. In their absence, let us raise our weapons, and swear an oath:
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 09.ogg Qubad: I, Qubad, son of Qabus, hereby pledge protection to you and all of your kin. May the oceans be stained red with my blood if I am ever to renounce this oath.

Media:vo kycop001 1909805 nesmil 01.ogg Nesmil: Wow, your friend is so dreamy! He's not a real prince by any chance, is he!?
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 nesmil 02.ogg Nesmil: Hey, Roshana, you don't want to miss this! The good-looking guy who left that huge tip is acting on stage with Darbil's troupe.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 roshana 01.ogg Roshana: Darbil's one lucky man.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 gundafar 01.ogg Gundafar: I return, Your Highness. I hope I'm not too late... Have you already promised peace to Frasiyav?
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 10.ogg Qubad: Nay, I am not so rash as to preempt my father's blessing. I promised only what I could so far — the safety of his kin.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 gundafar 02.ogg Gundafar: My child, I must share with you the gravest news. Qabus has become blinded by fanaticism and hatred, and will stop at nothing to vanquish every last man under Frasiyav's lead.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 11.ogg Qubad: How can this be? You mean to say that my father has rejected our proposal for peace?
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 gundafar 03.ogg Gundafar: He has indeed. I urged him to reconsider, and for this I was rebuked and dismissed from his service.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 gundafar 04.ogg Gundafar: But far stricter punishment than this awaits you, should you return home with your troops.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 gundafar 05.ogg Gundafar: Please heed my warnings, dear child. I dare not imagine what unspeakable atrocities your father intends to commit.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 12.ogg Qubad: Nay... The truce must stand. I cannot renounce my oath. How can man claim to stand above beast without remaining true to his word?
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 13.ogg Qubad: The masses have grown weary of death and conflict, in both our nation and theirs... Are we all to now bend to his will, and massacre countless more to satisfy a desire that is his alone?
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 14.ogg Qubad: When I departed my beloved home to fight in a foreign land, I did so to honor his wishes and for my duty to our people.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 15.ogg Qubad: Alas, is this fate's grand design... Is this fate's grand design...
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 qabus 01.ogg Darbil: Kaeya, the next line is: "Alas, is this fate's grand design, that I should spend the rest of my days in a foreign land, till I am laid to rest in a grave far from home?"
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 16.ogg Qubad: Must it be so...?
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 qabus 02.ogg Darbil: Huh? Wait, that's not a part of the script! Kaeya, did you not hear me?
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 17.ogg Qubad: My dear audience, I ask you this: Do you believe in fate? If fate decreed that your life was to end in tragedy, what would you do?

(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Why did he just throw the prop to me...)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Seems like improv with the audience... Guess I should play along.)
 I would bravely face my fate.
 I would challenge my fate, and rise above it.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 18.ogg Qubad: Oh...? Haha, then so must it be! Yes, so must it be!
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 19.ogg Qubad: I shall discard this intaglio, and rid myself of the shackles of fate.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 gundafar 06.ogg Gundafar: Wait, but that's not— My dear prince, do you intend to betray your father, and abandon your heritage?
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 20.ogg Qubad: Fate means to send the machinations of war to every corner of the land, to fan the flames of conflict till they engulf the entire world...
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 21.ogg Qubad: Fate would see my sword tainted with the blood of innocents, that the bright banner of my homeland might fly in every nation known to mankind.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 22.ogg Qubad: But I shall not bow to the will of fate. I am no pawn in heaven's plan.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 eymen 01.ogg Eymen: Bravo! Where did this guy come from? Is he one of the new hires?
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 oguz 01.ogg Oguz: Shut up, stop interrupting.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 23.ogg Qubad: I, Qubad, will spend the rest of my days in a foreign land, till I breathe my last in a place far from home.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 qabus 03.ogg Darbil: Whew, at least he brought it back in the end...
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 gundafar 07.ogg Gundafar: Prince Qubad, my child, there is no need to be rash. Please bring at least your fortune, and the retainers who will always be loyal to you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 24.ogg Qubad: Gundafar, my dear mentor... You have always been like a father to me. It brings me only anguish to bid you farewell.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 kaeya 25.ogg Qubad: But I must walk this path, or freedom dies by my hand. Goodbye, my tribe and kin. Farewell, sweet land of my birth.
Media:vo kycop001 1909805 gundafar 08.ogg Gundafar: Goodbye, my child.
The now-sizable audience bursts into applause.

(Talk to Oguz, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 oguz 02.ogg Oguz: The show is pretty good. Are you guys professional?
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Eymen, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 eymen 01.ogg Eymen: (It's too bad that Darbil's troupe is always on the move. I wish they could stay here for longer.)
(Talk to Eymen, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909801 eymen 02.ogg Eymen: Hmm... I wonder if I should go strike up a conversation with him?
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Kaeya, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: (So must it be... Hahaha, yes, so must it be!)
(Approach Kaeya and Nesmil)
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 nesmil 01.ogg Nesmil: Ahhhh, it's Prince Qubad... Could I please get your autograph?
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Why certainly, Ma'am.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 nesmil 02.ogg Nesmil: Ooh, thank you! I'll just go find a pen!
 Good show, Kaeya.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Hehe, feeling more like a fan now?
 I want an autograph, too.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Just an autograph? Well, you could get one of those at any time.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Acting is quite fun. If there ever came a day when I left the Knights of Favonius, I think I might go into acting full-time.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 tus 01.ogg Tus: Darbil, could you introduce me to this young man?
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 qabus 01.ogg Darbil: Ahh, my apologies, Master Tus... I somehow missed you in the crowd earlier.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 tus 02.ogg Tus: Haha, I was some distance away. I just came over near the end after I noticed the large crowd gathered around the stage.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 tus 03.ogg Tus: The performance was outstanding across the board. I knew that the poor turnout over the past few days was just bad luck. It was only ever a matter of time before you hit it big.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 tus 04.ogg Tus: The improvised section was particularly good — I think you can include some improvisation as a staple in future performances. As for the prop he threw, no need to get it back, it's fairly cheap anyway.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 qabus 02.ogg Darbil: Very well sir, Sir — and a big thanks also to our wonderful prince. Had Kaeya not agreed to fill in, we might have disbanded right on the spot...
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 tus 05.ogg Tus: Kaeya, was it? Well, young man, I must say you've made quite the impression on me. My caravan is always loaded with the finest food and wines. You are welcome to visit at any time.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Thank you for the invite, Sir, but I'm afraid I've reached the end of my time in Sumeru. I'm sure that my friends and family in Mondstadt must be missing me terribly.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 tus 06.ogg Tus: Haha, well then, consider it an open invitation. Once you've been bitten by the travel bug, my friend, you'll be getting itchy feet again before too long.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 tus 07.ogg Tus: My door is always open. If you're ever interested, please ask Darbil to reach out to me.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 tus 08.ogg Tus: Darbil, we can continue discussions on the sponsorship once you've wrapped up today's show. I'm going back to the inn.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 qabus 03.ogg Darbil: Thank you so much, Master Tus. I'll see you shortly.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 qabus 04.ogg Darbil: Seriously, Kaeya, thank you for bailing me out again. You're a good guy... May the gods bless you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 qabus 05.ogg Darbil: You know, you should stay for a few more days. I owe you a meal, at the very least...
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 gundafar 01.ogg Zabi: Darbil! Asgar is back, he lost track of time playing Genius Invokation TCG, you've gotta sort him out...
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 qabus 06.ogg Darbil: Genius Invokation? Again!? Ugh, that does it, that kid's not getting away with it this time... Please excuse me, Kaeya, I will be right back...
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Sure. There's no rush.
Media:vo kycop001 1909806 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: ...Okay, I think they're all gone. Let's slip away now, while we can.
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Kaeya, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: (I always like to extricate myself before things start getting tedious.)
(Approach Kaeya)
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Alright, this should be far enough. Don't think they'll find me here.
 Weren't you gonna sign some autographs?
 Didn't want to stay for a free meal sometime?
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: People were starting to expect a lot of things that I didn't sign up for. Besides, the missing actor is back now — Darbil shouldn't be needing me to stand in again.
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: I don't mind socializing, but compared to chatting over food and drink, I much prefer just going wild on the stage.
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: What about you? Did you enjoy the show?
 I thought your performance was intriguing.
 Mostly, I was curious to know what was going through your mind on stage.
 I wasn't expecting that improv section.
 Mostly, I was curious to know what was going through your mind on stage.
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Oh? I was expecting a lengthier critique, but you've thrown the question right back at me... Sneaky. Alright, I'll rise to your challenge.
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Let me think... "All the world's a stage, and all the people merely players." Does that answer your question?
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Perhaps there's an inept god out there deciding everyone's fates... much like the Akademiya student drafting Darbil's scripts.
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Yep, "inept" is a good word for it. Honestly, it might even be a little too civil to describe a god who turns fathers against their sons and is bent on endless warmongering... don't you think?
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: Anyway, that's exactly why actors need to wake up and realize they don't have to follow the script. There's nothing to stop them from following their gut and making it up as they go along.
 Do you really believe that?
 Does this inept god really exist?
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Oh, my dear (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), please don't take me too literally. I don't want you to get the wrong idea. The "god" is just a figure of speech — the real point I'm making is about the actors.
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Everyone, you and I included, is both an actor and a member of the audience.
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: If you don't like the script, just walk off the stage and join the audience. You always have a choice.
 That sounds... difficult...
 I'm not sure I fully understand...
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: A little too obtuse? Hahaha, well don't dwell on it — it's nothing worth losing sleep over. I was just thinking aloud.
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: Relax, be yourself, do your thing. That's all I'm really trying to say.
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: When I did my little bit of audience interaction back there, you had no time to prepare. You had to just say what you thought in the moment. I think those spontaneous thoughts are often the most authentic... And that's why I liked your answer.
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 17.ogg Kaeya: You're still holding onto the Intaglio I threw to you from the stage, right? Keep it. Think of it as a souvenir of my improvised performance.
Media:vo kycop001 1909807 kaeya 18.ogg Kaeya: It's been the most fascinating day, hasn't it, little birdie? ♪...

Suspicious Trails[]
 Quest DescriptionThe self-proclaimed Editor-in-Chief of The Steambird and a journalist come for an ad-hoc interview with Yun Jin, but they seem somewhat suspicious...

(Talk to Yun Jin again, optional)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903756 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: They must have left the tea house by now. Let me know if you find anything out.
(Go to downstairs)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 shiyun 01.ogg Shiyun: I just, ugh... How can you be so cruel to Ms. Yun!?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 01.ogg Boyi: Shh! Keep your voice down. Whatever you've got to say, it can wait until we're out of earshot. We'll both be in hot water if Yun Jin finds out!

(If you are too far)

You do not know where the two have gone...

(Proceed to Suspicious Trails (Continuation))
(If you are too close)

Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 boyi 01.ogg Boyi: Eh? Who're you... Oh, the one with Yun Jin just now.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 boyi 02.ogg Boyi: So you've been lying in ambush for us, huh... Hey, c'mon! Scram!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 shiyun 01.ogg Shiyun: Uh, okay... okay!

You do not know where the two have gone...

(Proceed to Suspicious Trails (Continuation))
(Follow Shiyun and Boyi)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903851 boyi 01.ogg Boyi: *sigh* What is wrong with you? Why can't you get it into your head?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903851 boyi 02.ogg Boyi: Quit asking dull questions and start thinking about how to win over our readers. Do I make myself clear?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903851 boyi 03.ogg Boyi: I don't think you realize what a golden opportunity you have here. How many journalists would give anything they had to trade places with you right now, huh? Ever think about that?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903851 shiyun 01.ogg Shiyun: You... You just don't get it! Ms. Yun has put her heart and soul into—
Media:vo yjcop001 1903851 boyi 04.ogg Boyi: Enough! Stop yelling in public! Or do you want Ms. Yun to hear about all the lies you're spreading about her?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903851 shiyun 02.ogg Shiyun: Me!? You're the one making everything up...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903851 boyi 05.ogg Boyi: Huh, well you sure seemed pretty happy chatting to her, so don't act like you ain't a part of this. And don't forget the contract you signed...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903851 boyi 06.ogg Boyi: Come. We'll continue our little chat over there. You need to listen and learn, young lady!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903851 shiyun 03.ogg Shiyun: I... I...
(Proceed to A Strict Contract)

A Strict Contract[]

Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 02.ogg Boyi: Are you ready to stop whining now? Do you have any idea how rare an opportunity like this is for a small-time paper like ours!?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 03.ogg Boyi: Just think of the sales if we can get an exclusive... Hehehe, we'd have enough to cover your salary for two lifetimes!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 shiyun 02.ogg Shiyun: B—But... what about us pretending to be from The Steambird? Aren't you worried she'll find out?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 04.ogg Boyi: Hmph. You really think she still would've talked to you if I hadn't told that little white lie? Besides, what have you got to be afraid of?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 05.ogg Boyi: As long as we make it sound like an eyewitness account, how will she be able to refute it? Heck, if she actually presses the issue, I'll probably have to thank her for keeping it current for me! Hehehe...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 shiyun 03.ogg Shiyun: This is horrible! I will not let you treat Ms. Yun like this!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 06.ogg Boyi: Pff. I don't know who she thinks she is, anyway. "Ooh, I sang a couple of shows, so now I'm a national superstar!" Gimme a break.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 07.ogg Boyi: No one wants to read about your sopranos or your falsettos. We give the readers what they want! That's how this business works.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 08a.ogg Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 08b.ogg Boyi: Hmph, case in point — that blond [sic] (‍guyguyText for male Traveler/galgalText for female Traveler‍) seemed to be getting along pretty well with Yun Jin. There's definitely a story there, even if there isn't...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 shiyun 04.ogg Shiyun: That's enough! I'm reporting you to the Millelith!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 09.ogg Boyi: Report me? What for? Libel? Identity theft? Good luck with that. I haven't written anything! Where's your proof?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 shiyun 05.ogg Shiyun: I... I...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 10.ogg Boyi: You'd better tread carefully, Missy! First you neglect your own duties, and now you're trying to get in the way of mine?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 11.ogg Boyi: You signed the contract, you know full well the consequences. If you sabotage this interview, I'll make sure you lose everything you have. I will ruin you, you understand!?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 shiyun 06.ogg Shiyun: ...Why oh why did I sign that contract...
 (No need to check in with Yun Jin. This ends now!)
(Proceed to Alerting the Quarry)
 (I should stay hidden for now and check in with Yun Jin.)
(Proceed to Long-Term Planning)

(If you were too far)

 I couldn't catch up with them...

Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 12.ogg Boyi: Who's there!?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 13.ogg Boyi: Oh... it's you? What do you want? ...I'm warning you, don't do anything stupid, or, or I'll...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 14.ogg Boyi: I'll spread a lovely little story about you and Yun Jin throughout all of Liyue!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 shiyun 07.ogg Shiyun: Wait a second! I was so focused on Ms. Yun earlier that I didn't notice who it was...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 15.ogg Boyi: Huh? What are you talking about?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 shiyun 08a.ogg Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 shiyun 08b.ogg Shiyun: (‍HeHeText for male Traveler/SheSheText for female Traveler‍)'s the Traveler! You know? The one who even the Qixing will listen to!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 16.ogg Boyi: What the... What have I gotten myself into...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 17.ogg Boyi: Ahem... Uh, hehe, no need to get all worked up here, wh—wh—what we meant was, was...
 No more lies.
 Stop playing dirty.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 18.ogg Boyi: Ahem! Um... Yes! Quite right, you're quite right. I'm disappearing into thin air as we speak...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 boyi 19.ogg Boyi: (Ugh, just my luck...)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 shiyun 09.ogg Shiyun: I'm so, so sorry... I had no idea it was going to turn out like this.
 I heard everything. It's not your fault.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 shiyun 10.ogg Shiyun: But I'm so ashamed... I don't know how I could face Ms. Yun now.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903802 shiyun 11.ogg Shiyun: So please, please pass on my apologies to her.
(Talk to Yun Jin)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903801 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Did you find anything out?
 Shiyun asked me to apologize on her behalf...

Ending: A Shame That the Road is Rocky[]

Media:vo yjcop001 1903801 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: It's just a bit of a shame that I didn't get to talk with Shiyun for longer.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903801 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: She genuinely understands opera, and has a passion for it. That's not something you can act.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903801 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: If I had the chance to talk with her more in-depth, it could well provide me with some fresh inspiration.
 I didn't know that this is what you had in mind.

Media:vo yjcop001 1903801 yunning 02.ogg Yunning: Did you agree to another interview without notifying me?
 I don't think they're coming back...
 She didn't say anything to give cause for concern...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903801 yunning 03.ogg Yunning: These tabloid types are total scumbags, all of them. Who knows what innocent detail he might end up turning into the next big scandal?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903801 yunning 04.ogg Yunning: Sure, nothing might have come of it today. But who knows where it'll go tomorrow.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903801 yunning 05.ogg Yunning: Short of catching them all in their lair in one fell swoop... Who knows when this is going to end.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903801 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: *sigh*... I'm sorry, I was careless on this occasion.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903801 yunning 06.ogg Yunning: Well, wallowing isn't gonna solve anything. C'mon, go tell everyone in the troupe to be extra cautious during this time.

(If you approach them instead)

Media:vo yjcop001 1903804 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: I see. I knew there was something fishy about that editor-in-chief, but this is a bigger plot twist than I expected...
 Should we report it to the Millelith?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903804 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: Not yet. All he's done so far is ask a few questions, there's nothing in print yet. The Millelith wouldn't be able to do anything even if we got them involved.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903804 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: Besides, if we rush to report him now, it's only going to give him more material to write about.
 It can't be the first time they've done this...
 There has to be some evidence at their base of operations...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903804 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: You're right. But tabloids like theirs never have permanent offices and printing presses.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903804 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: The moment they hear anything, they'll disappear without a trace, and you've got no chance of catching them.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903804 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: I'm... actually more concerned about another detail you told me...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903804 yunjin 08.ogg Yun Jin: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), would you be willing to do me another favor? I want to send a letter... to that journalist.
 Sure, leave it to me.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903804 yunjin 09.ogg Yun Jin: Great. Thank you.
Yun Jin immediately drafts a letter...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903804 yunjin 10.ogg Yun Jin: Phew... The editor should be here soon, so I'll stay here to deal with him. I'll have to rely on you to deliver the letter.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903804 yunjin 11.ogg Yun Jin: If everything goes well, we should be able to get some breathing room for a while.
(Obtain  Yun Jin's Personal Letter)
(Talk to Yun Jin, optional)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903850 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Thanks for your help. I'll try to keep him occupied and buy us more time.

(At the location)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903809 boyi 01.ogg Boyi: I've had it with you! Do you think contracts are just bits of paper?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903809 boyi 02.ogg Boyi: If we weren't on a tight deadline, you'd better believe I'd fire you right here on the spot!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903809 boyi 03.ogg Boyi: You will stay here and reflect on your actions if you know what's good for you. Sorry, but I'm not babysitting you anymore today.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903809 shiyun 01.ogg Shiyun: Ohh... What am I going to do...
You show up once the Editor-in-Chief is sufficiently far away...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903809 shiyun 02.ogg Shiyun: Ah! You're, you're...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903809 shiyun 03.ogg Shiyun: ...The one who was with Ms. Yun earlier?
 Yun Jin wrote this letter for you.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903809 shiyun 04.ogg Shiyun: Really? Ms. Yun wrote me a letter? ...I'll read it right away!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903810 shiyun 01.ogg Shiyun: Hmm... hmm... Wow. Really? I can't believe this!
 What does the letter say?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903810 shiyun 02.ogg Shiyun: Ms. Yun says that under Liyue law, any penalty charge I have to pay may not substantially exceed the amount of my salary.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903810 shiyun 03.ogg Shiyun: You can't have a labor contract that would completely bankrupt the employee in the event of a breach. It's not legally binding.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903810 shiyun 04.ogg Shiyun: So not only can he not get any money off of me, I can take this contract to the Ministry of Civil Affairs and blow the whistle on him!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903810 shiyun 05.ogg Shiyun: I didn't think about any of this when I was job hunting... I just signed the contract without a second thought...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903810 shiyun 06.ogg Shiyun: I always thought Ms. Yun was all about opera... who would have thought she was such a legal expert, too?
 This is quite the solution she came up with.
 She is quite amazing.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903810 shiyun 07.ogg Shiyun: *sigh* If only I hadn't gone out of my way to get Ms. Yun's attention in the first place, none of this would have happened...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903810 shiyun 08.ogg Shiyun: I didn't expect it to end up with Ms. Yun helping fix my life problems...
 Can you lead me to their base of operations?
 Can you provide more evidence?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903810 shiyun 09.ogg Shiyun: Well... Mr. Boyi says I'm still on probation, so he won't tell me where their work location is...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903810 shiyun 10.ogg Shiyun: Plus, I give all my draft articles straight to him, so I don't have anything in the way of evidence...
 Maybe he's planning to fire you once your probation period ends?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903810 shiyun 11.ogg Shiyun: I... wouldn't put it past him.
 What a calculating and conniving guy.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903810 shiyun 12.ogg Shiyun: But the letter says that my statement and the contract are enough to get the Millelith looking into it!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903810 shiyun 13.ogg Shiyun: If Ms. Yun says so, I'm sure she must be right! Let's go confront him right now.

(Confront Boyi)
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: ...Okay, I think I've covered this topic pretty thoroughly now. Unless you had any more questions?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 boyi 03.ogg Boyi: Haha... What can I say Ms. Yun, you have so many wonderful qualities. Let's not quit while the ball's rolling, huh? Otherwise, I'll think of something I didn't ask later, and by then it'll be too late.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 boyi 04.ogg Boyi: So, uh... Hey, where's that, uh, friend of yours who was here earlier? You guys seemed pretty close?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 boyi 05.ogg Boyi: Not intentionally avoiding the interview, surely? Hehehe...
 I'm right here.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), you're finally back. This poor gentleman's been waiting for you.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 boyi 06.ogg Boyi: You... you're with Shiyun? Hey, what's going on here? Hey, Shiyun, don't forget the contract you signed!
 Funny, that contract's just what we came to discuss.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 shiyun 02.ogg Shiyun: The Traveler clued me in! This contract you made me sign? It isn't worth the paper it's written on!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 boyi 07.ogg Boyi: Isn't worth the paper it's written on? Don't be ridiculous. It's all there, clear as day. Don't you think I did my research?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: Research? Oh, so you're a news editor, but you also have an interest in law?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 boyi 08.ogg Boyi: Heh... hehe, she's new, and she's making a fool of herself. She doesn't get how this all works. My apologies, now, back to our interview...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: No, it's okay. In fact, I've found myself delving into some legal texts myself recently. It's all so intricate and complicated that it's very difficult to take it all in.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: The contracts of our opera troupe are a case in point. I'd finally finished reading through the relevant documentation from the Yuehai Pavilion when suddenly the Qixing announced a new interpretation...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: So I'm just curious — how can you be completely sure that you didn't miss anything when you were researching this?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 boyi 09.ogg Boyi: Uh... I... I'm pretty sure I read everything relevant...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 shiyun 03.ogg Shiyun: Under current legislation, the penalty terms in my labor contract are unreasonable and exploitative. I could report you to the Millelith for extortion!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 boyi 10.ogg Boyi: N—Nonsense! That's ridiculous...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: My goodness... Sir, it seems that we should probably bring this interview to a close here.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 boyi 11.ogg Boyi: Don't listen to her! I run a legitimate business, everything we do's aboveboard...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 08.ogg Yun Jin: Oh, I have no doubt about that at all, Sir. But this reminds of a case I read about not long ago. Once you get reported and the Millelith start scrutinizing your business, well...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 09.ogg Yun Jin: Not only do they look into every license you have and every work you've ever published, but everything down to your fire safety policy will come under their magnifying glass, as well...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 10.ogg Yun Jin: So if you don't get back now and start preparing for their arrival...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 11.ogg Yun Jin: Well... I mean, I don't mind continuing the interview at all. But I'd hate to take up too much of your precious time if there's any aspect of your business you want to double-check from a legal standpoint.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 boyi 12.ogg Boyi: Ugh... You... I won't forget this!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 shiyun 04.ogg Shiyun: Hey, where do you think you're going!
The Editor-in-Chief leaves in a panic...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 shiyun 05.ogg Shiyun: Ms. Yun, why did you stop me?
 Are we really just going to let him go?
 He'll destroy all the evidence the moment he gets back.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 shiyun 06.ogg Shiyun: Right! And the contract I have is enough to get him arrested... Isn't it?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 12.ogg Yun Jin: Hehe...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 13.ogg Yun Jin: I'm not a legal expert. I haven't the faintest idea.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 14.ogg Yun Jin: All that was just an act, aimed at getting him to show us the way.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 shiyun 07.ogg Shiyun: An act? Show us the way to what?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunning 01.ogg Yunning: Yun Jin, the Millelith are after him. Based on his movements, it looks like Boyi is heading back to his headquarters.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunning 02.ogg Yunning: *sigh* I really hope they teach these tabloids a lesson they won't forget. It'd sure make my life a lot easier...
 Ah, I see what's going on.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 15.ogg Yun Jin: Yes, I had Yunning report to the Millelith while you were delivering the letter for me.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 16.ogg Yun Jin: The penalty terms in Shiyun's contract are too severe. Even if they don't violate the law, I'm sure he must be taking advantage of some loopholes.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 17.ogg Yun Jin: Anyone who works like that is sure to have a guilty conscience. So all I had to do was put on a little show, starring the editor-in-chief of The Steambird...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 18.ogg Yun Jin: And now, he is sure to lead us to the solid evidence.
 I can't believe you even kept us in the dark...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 19.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm-hmm, well, acting has to be authentic to be believable.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunning 03.ogg Yunning: Their little publication will go out of business in no time. Good riddance, I say.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunning 04.ogg Yunning: I hope this gets the other tabloids to rein in their antics, too... Hey, here's a thought — maybe we could get him to rat on some of his rival publications?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 shiyun 08.ogg Shiyun: Ah... I only just realized what this means...
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 shiyun 09.ogg Shiyun: I'm... I'm going to be out of a job, aren't I?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 20.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm... Well, would you still be interested in submitting an article to The Steambird — but the real one, this time?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 shiyun 10.ogg Shiyun: Y—Yes, of course! But... would they really accept an article from me...?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 21.ogg Yun Jin: Yunning, when can we arrange the next interview for?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunning 05.ogg Yunning: Oh, so NOW you're asking me? Two days from now. Morning. Work for you?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 22.ogg Yun Jin: Okay. Shiyun, let's continue our discussion about tonight's play two days from now.
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 shiyun 11.ogg Shiyun: Does this mean... I get to do a full feature interview with you?
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 shiyun 12.ogg Shiyun: Okay... I think I know what I want to write about! Thank you, Ms. Yun!
Media:vo yjcop001 1903805 yunjin 23.ogg Yun Jin: Don't mention it. I'm sure it will be a source of inspiration for both of us.

The Cat's Tail's Bartender[]

(Talk to Nimrod)
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 nimrod 01.ogg Nimrod: Mmm... drinks at The Cat's Tail. Not bad... not bad at all...
 The Cat's Tail?
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 nimrod 02.ogg Nimrod: Oh hey, it's you, Traveler. ...Huh? Y—You've never heard of The Cat's Tail?
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 nimrod 03.ogg Nimrod: Judging from your expression, seems like you really don't know the place. Boy, have you been missing out...
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 nimrod 04.ogg Nimrod: The Cat's Tail is renowned for its incredible specialty drinks. I'm talking drinks you've definitely never tasted before.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 nimrod 05.ogg Nimrod: And just as its name suggests, there are loads of cute kitties at The Cat's Tail.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 nimrod 06.ogg Nimrod: Time simply starts slipping away when you're enjoying a delicious specialty cocktail and surrounded by a bunch of cute kitties...
 Is The Cat's Tail still open right now?
 I'd like to go check it out...
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 nimrod 07.ogg Nimrod: Uh, but you don't seem of age to drink yet.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 nimrod 08.ogg Nimrod: Well, that shouldn't be a problem, Diona will be there. She's the best bartender in all of Mondstadt!
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 nimrod 09.ogg Nimrod: It should be a piece of cake for her to whip you up a drink with no alcohol in it.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 nimrod 10.ogg Nimrod: Oh, and not to mention, Diona is also pretty cute... just like a little kitty.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 nimrod 11.ogg Nimrod: *hic* Oh no... did I say that out loud? Uh, please don't tell her I said that!
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 nimrod 12.ogg Nimrod: Anyway, if you want to check out The Cat's Tail for yourself, the entrance is just around the back.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 nimrod 13.ogg Nimrod: I'm gonna... *hic* go over there and sober up a bit, I don't think I can handle a fifth round quite yet... I drank way too much already.
(Talk to Diona)
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 01.ogg Diona: All out of ingredients... again. Ugh, I really don't understand why these adults love to drink so much.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 01.ogg Margaret: Because all the drinks you make are so delicious! All it takes is just one sip and they're hooked.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 02.ogg Diona: Hmph, and I thought self-control was the most important quality of being an adult.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 02.ogg Margaret: Well, it just so happens that self-control often falls by the wayside when someone's enjoying one of your delicious specialty drinks!
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 03.ogg Diona: All that means is that they're nothin' but a bunch of drunkards that don't know when to stop...
 Aww look, it's a kitty.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 04.ogg Diona: Hey! Who you calling "kitty"!? Haven't you seen anyone of the Kätzlein bloodline before?
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 03a.ogg Margaret: Oh, hello there. Are you here to visit the Cat's Tail?
 I'm here for the kitties...
(Go to Branch 1)
 I want to try some new specialty drinks...
(Go to Branch 2/3)

Branch 1[]

Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 04.ogg Margaret: Here for the kitties, huh? Hehe, I suppose we do have a lot of cute cats here.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 05.ogg Margaret: They're all quite friendly. In fact, many other customers are here for the same reason.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 06.ogg Margaret: After all, there aren't many places in Mondstadt where you can just relax and interact with friendly cats.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 05.ogg Diona: Hmph, I've never seen such a bunch of arrogant and stubborn cats. I don't understand why people like them so much. Besides, shouldn't the main purpose for going to a tavern to be drinking, without getting cat hair in your beverage?
 Maybe everyone just thinks the cats are cute?
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 06.ogg Diona: What kind of reason is that!? So as long as they're cute, nothing else matters?
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 07.ogg Margaret: Well, judging from the customers, that seems to be the case, hehe.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 08a.ogg Margaret: See? This traveler is here for the cats as well.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 09.ogg Margaret: However, you've come at a most unfortunate time. Our cats seem to have snuck out to play somewhere.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 10.ogg Margaret: If you're willing to wait, Diona here should be able to bring them back shortly...
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 07.ogg Diona: Huh? When did I agree to fetch those little troublemakers!?
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 11.ogg Margaret: Consider it a task straight from tavern management. Besides, the cats are quite fond of you, so you're the natural pick for the job.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 08.ogg Diona: *sigh* They're probably just bored and wandering off to get people's attention.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 12.ogg Margaret: Is that so? Hehe... Well anyway, it'll be up to you to bring them back here.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 13.ogg Margaret: Oh, and didn't you say that you're here to see the kitties? If you're up for it, perhaps you could accompany Diona to retrieve them.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 14.ogg Margaret: Maybe after interacting with them for a bit, the cats will get to know you and seek more of your attention.
 I understand.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 15.ogg Margaret: The three cats that snuck out are Roger, Nelson, and Paisley. Diona, you usually take care of them, so you should be quite familiar with these three, right?
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 09.ogg Diona: Ugh, them again! And they even dared to sneak out during working hours... Don't they have any sense of duty as tavern cats?
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 16.ogg Margaret: Come on, not every kitty can be as reliable and caring as you, Diona.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 10.ogg Diona: I am not a cat!
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 11.ogg Diona: ...Whatever. So all we have to do is to bring them back to the tavern, right? This shouldn't be a problem, let's scurry out of here. They love wandering around the center of town, so let's check there first.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 17.ogg Margaret: I'll leave you to it. In the meantime, I'll keep an eye on things here at the tavern. Once you've found the little rascals, please bring them right back.
(Proceed to To Catch a Kitten)

Branch 2/3[]

Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 18.ogg Margaret: Oh, you're here for the drinks? Unfortunately, we're pretty much out of ingredients, besides...
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 12.ogg Diona: Besides, you don't look like you're even old enough to drink yet!
 I'm a lot older than I look...
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 13.ogg Diona: Hah! That's what every underage person says when they come here trying to sneak a drink.
 A non-alcoholic beverage would be fine as well.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 14.ogg Diona: A non-alcoholic beverage? There are tons of other places in Mondstadt that serve that.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 15.ogg Diona: But seeing as you came all the way to a tavern for a non-alcoholic drink, that must mean you have your own views about alcohol, right?
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 16.ogg Diona: Unless you just want to try a drink because you think it's the romantic thing that adults do. Hmph, those sleazy old men over there once thought the same thing, you know!
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 17.ogg Diona: *sigh* I just don't get why everyone is so obsessed with alcohol. What's so good about it anyway?
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 19.ogg Margaret: That's enough, Diona. This traveler obviously made a trip here to have a drink. We should always do our best to satisfy the customers' needs.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 margaret 20.ogg Margaret: Consider this the tavern management's request.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 18.ogg Diona: Ugh, oh alright! So one special cocktail is all I need to make, right?
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 19.ogg Diona: Fine, since you seem to fantasize about alcohol so much, I'll make you something that'll crush whatever dreams you've had about the stuff.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 20.ogg Diona: That way, maybe you won't become another one of those annoying and smelly old drunks...
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 21.ogg Diona: Though we do have some drink base and flavoring ingredients left, since you're looking for a special drink, I'm willing to put in the effort and search for some special ingredients.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 22.ogg Diona: But considering the time, I can only make either the drink's base or flavoring more special.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 23.ogg Diona: So... what'll it be? The drink's base or flavoring to be more unique? Hmm?
 I'd like the base to be more unique...
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 24.ogg Diona: A drink with a special base, huh? Hm, looks like you already possess plenty of potential to become a roaring drunkard. I'm gonna have to really knock some sense into you with this one.
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 25.ogg Diona: Ahem... Anyway, let's head to Dadaupa Gorge, I know just the place to find a unique drink base.
(Proceed to A Special Base Drink)
 I'd like the flavoring to be more unique...
Media:vo dancop001 1910101 diona 26.ogg Diona: A drink with special flavoring huh? Well, that'll be easy enough, I was planning on looking for some more flavorings anyway. Hm, I've got a list of things we can search for.
Media:vo dancop001 1910105 diona 01.ogg Diona: Hmm... let's go visit Blanche first. I placed an order for some flavoring ingredients that should be ready by now.
(Proceed to Special Cocktailing Condiments)

(Approach the location)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914701 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: "John Doe was playing cards with a child. When he lost the game, he got angry and proceeded to steal his opponent's cards..."
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914701 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Which article of the Gang Bylaws did John Doe violate?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914701 mamoru 01.ogg Mamoru: You kidding me? He was mad about losing, so he robbed a kid? Which gang is this John Doe punk from, we gotta go teach him a lesson!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914701 genta 01.ogg Genta: Yeah! Everyone knows, don't hate the player, hate the game! Who does this clown think he is?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914701 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Just answer the question. Also, "John Doe" is just a hypothetical character.
 This lesson is pretty legit...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914701 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Ah, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Welcome to the class.
 Are the Gang Bylaws doing the job?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914701 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Pretty difficult to say so far.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914701 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: But at least the punishments I use in class will get them spending their energy on something meaningful...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914701 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: If it keeps them out of trouble, I'll consider it a win.
 What punishments?
 Meaningful in what way?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914701 shinobu 08.ogg Kuki Shinobu: You'll see very shortly. Hey, have you got an answer for me yet?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914701 akira 01.ogg Akira: Umm... the one about not bullying children... that's the second one, right? But then, it also kinda fits "damaging property," which is the first...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914701 genta 02.ogg Genta: How about I answer article 1 and you answer article 2? One of us has gotta be right, so at least we won't get punished as hard...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914701 mamoru 02.ogg Mamoru: Alright! Shinobu, we've decided...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914701 shinobu 09.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Wrong. John Doe violates both articles 1 and 2 of the Gang Bylaws, and the additional notes to Article 2, Clause 36 also apply in this case.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914701 shinobu 10.ogg Kuki Shinobu: As for your "punishment"... Each of you must write out all the relevant rules in full three times.

Thanks for Your Hospitality![]

Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Oh, welcome! It must've been a while since you were last here.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Since it's about time to eat, I couldn't resist whipping up a little something for us.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: So please, help yourself. Hope you enjoy it.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: And... I can't claim to compete with the likes of Uyuu Restaurant's chef, but I think I did alright.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: What's wrong? You look shocked!
 After that hot pot game, I figured self-sabotage was your cooking style...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Whoa, whoa, there's been a misunderstanding!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: I admit, I may have added a few weird things to that hot pot. But it was just a game!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: For normal meals, I cook normal dishes. I am a housekeeper, after all — wouldn't have gotten very far without a few culinary skills!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: Anyway, please dig in. I won't get the chance to cook for you like this every day.
You promptly polish off everything on the table.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: Well, seems like my cooking has your seal of approval.
 Thanks for your hospitality.
 It was delicious!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: You're welcome. When you're out adventuring on your own, you've got to maintain your quality of life.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: Take your cape, for example. I definitely see one or two loose threads there.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: If you ignore them, sooner or later the whole seam is going to come undone, and then you'll have a really tough time mending it.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: Let me sew it up for you later — I'm pretty handy with a needle and thread.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: Speaking of housekeeping — I can say with confidence that you won't find anyone as handy around the home as I am.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: Cleaning, cooking, and mending are among my greatest strengths. You can always feel free to hand me jobs like this.
 Housekeeping, huh...
 If this is your strength...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 17.ogg Thoma: Hmm? What is it?
 You could run a housekeeping class for the Yashiro Commission!
 This is how you can start winning more respect!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 18.ogg Thoma: Wait... you're suggesting I teach housekeeping to the Yashiro Commission staff?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 19.ogg Thoma: I'm not sure it would work... I doubt anyone would sign up for that class.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 20.ogg Thoma: I just don't think it's realistic to change people's perception of me by showcasing my housekeeping skills... I'm surprised that whole matter is still troubling you, actually.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 21.ogg Thoma: With that being said, finding an opportunity to share some housekeeping wisdom with the Yashiro Commission would certainly be in people's best interests.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 22.ogg Thoma: Life maintenance is important. You have to look after yourself if you're going to bring your best self to your work.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 23.ogg Thoma: You know what? Let's give it a try! But first, how do you think I should promote it?
 We need to get out there and spread the word.
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 Let's keep it within the Yashiro Commission.
(Proceed to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 We need to get out there and spread the word.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 24.ogg Thoma: You think so? In that case, I need to prepare.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 25.ogg Thoma: If I'm going to end up with a lot of students, I should make sure I have all the supplies I need for the class.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 26.ogg Thoma: Tables and chairs I can sort out easily enough, but I'll need to stock up on materials and ingredients for the textiles and cookery segments...
 I can handle that.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 27.ogg Thoma: Are you sure? That'd be greatly appreciated. Umm, let's see... to start with, I'll be needing Lavender Melon, Fowl, and Flour.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 28.ogg Thoma: Once we have all our essentials, we can figure out the next steps.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 29.ogg Thoma: I really hope everything goes smoothly...
(Proceed to Start Spreadin' the News)

Branch 2[]

 Let's keep it within the Yashiro Commission.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 30.ogg Thoma: Alright then. If we're only opening this up to Yashiro Commission staff, it shouldn't take too much preparation.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 31.ogg Thoma: Tables and chairs I can sort out easily enough, but we'll need to think some more about how exactly to promote this.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911301 thoma 32.ogg Thoma: Let's start by asking around at the Yashiro Commission headquarters.

The Truth Beyond the Truth[]

Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 01.ogg Elodie: ...Hmph, hahaha... What was that word you used, "ally"? You think that someone as foolish as him is worthy to call himself my ally?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 02.ogg Elodie: They were worthless scum, all of them — not just Bernard and Pierre, but those Lefeveres, too! They always just saw me as a tool!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 03.ogg Elodie: I lost all my chances of a normal life just because I was born into their lot! Not only that, but because they wanted me to become an undercover agent, they stripped me of my name, too!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 04.ogg Elodie: I had to live in constant fear of them while they were alive, and even once they were gone, I had to continue to bury my heritage and my name... Always worrying that their enemies would come knocking at the door...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 05.ogg Elodie: Do you know anything about what I've been through over all these years? My life as the last Lefervere!?
(If Passive Check succeeds)

(Insight Check Success) Elodie's expression seems a bit unnatural...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (There's a hint of drama in the voice of the suddenly agitated Elodie. It feels like her anger may be part of some kind of bluff...)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: I don't, and neither do I care.
 No one asked about your past.
 You can save that speech for the trial.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 06.ogg Elodie: ...Are, are you... Are you for real!? Aren't you a Lefevere victim, too!?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: ...Elodie, you're the only one still living under the shadow of a name.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 chevreuse 01.ogg Chevreuse: That's enough! Keep your hands where I can see them and do not resist arrest! If you have more to say, save it for the interrogation room.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 07.ogg Elodie: What a joke... What a joke!! Hey! Don't come any closer!
File:Closure Elodie's Device.png
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: What's that—
(If Passive Check succeeds)

(Perception Check Success) This device seems a bit odd...
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (The small device that Elodie took out appears very crude, as if it's made from paper mache...)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 08.ogg Elodie: Know what this is? Hahaha... I've secretly planted loads of explosives in the Humane Society! Just one step closer and...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 09.ogg Elodie: Whether they're cats, dogs, or just unlucky human employees, they'll all be blown up into smithereens!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 10.ogg Elodie: Surely, you bunch of goody two-shoes won't let that happen, right?
 [Persuasion] (Try to convince Elodie to surrender.)
(If the card drawn is less than 15)

 Whoa, just calm down for a minute here...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 11.ogg Elodie: That's enough! I have nothing left to say to any of you! Gardemeks, get 'em!
(If the card drawn is greater than or equal to 15)

 It wasn't your choice to be born into a family of villains...
 But that cannot justify your choice to also walk the path of evil.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 13.ogg Elodie: What do you understand about any of this!? I've suffered years of sleepless nights because of this name! I was sure that the moment I closed my eyes, someone seeking vengeance would descend upon me, calling for my blood...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 14.ogg Elodie: ...I finally found an opportunity to earn enough money to start a second life, and dump this name and all of its baggage onto Pierre...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 15.ogg Elodie: And you just had to go and ruin all of it!!!
 If you choose to flee and go into exile now...
 You'll only end up living under more fear and terror on your own.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 16.ogg Elodie: I... Ugh, then what am I supposed to do... Do I even have any choice!?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 17.ogg Elodie: ...Argh!
As Elodie's resolve begins to waver, she is knocked out by a hard blow from behind...
(Continue to next section)
 [Intimidation] (Help Chevreuse to intimidate Elodie.)
(If the card drawn is less than 15)

 Whoa, just calm down for a minute here...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 11.ogg Elodie: That's enough! I have nothing left to say to any of you! Gardemeks, get 'em!
(If the card drawn is greater than or equal to 15)

Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 chevreuse 03.ogg Chevreuse: Do you know what would happen to you if you were to run away now? The entire Special Patrol would be out hunting for you day and night to the ends of the world!
 And all of Fontaine would know...
 That a spawn of Lefevere still lives among them.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 chevreuse 04.ogg Chevreuse: ...Once word of that gets out, all the factions in Fontaine would be after you. But if you throw away the device now, I'll still count that as turning yourself in to the Gardes.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 chevreuse 05.ogg Chevreuse: Would you rather go back with me now and wait for a trial, or wait for your enemies to find you, and subject you to the same interrogation techniques that your relatives were once infamous for?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 18.ogg Elodie: No... I... I can't...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 19.ogg Elodie: ...Argh!
As Elodie's resolve begins to waver, she is knocked out by a hard blow from behind...
(Continue to next section)
 [Deception] (Assist Lyney in deceiving Elodie.)
(If the card drawn is less than 15)

 Whoa, just calm down for a minute here...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 11.ogg Elodie: That's enough! I have nothing left to say to any of you! Gardemeks, get 'em!
(If the card drawn is greater than or equal to 15)

Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 lyney 01.ogg Lyney: ...I can understand how you feel. Like you, we are also victims of the Lefevere clan.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 lyney 02.ogg Lyney: But if you were to endanger innocents now for your own gain, the public anger towards the Lefeveres would only rise to a boiling point!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 lyney 03.ogg Lyney: And the families of the new victims would be dead set on exacting revenge on you.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 20.ogg Elodie: Hmph... and what of it?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 lyney 04.ogg Lyney: ...I'll be your hostage, Elodie.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 21.ogg Elodie: ...What?
 Don't do this, Lyney.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 lyney 05.ogg Lyney: Thanks for your concern, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)... But we need to end all of the hate and violence arising from this clan once and for all.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 lyney 06.ogg Lyney: ...I'll raise my hands and come over slowly. I promise that I am completely unarmed.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 22.ogg Elodie: ...I'm watching you. Don't think for a second you can pull a fast one on me!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 lyney 07.ogg Lyney: Mhm, that's right... Just keep your eyes on me, don't look away...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 23.ogg Elodie: ...Argh!
As Elodie fixates her gaze on Lyney, she is struck by a hard blow from behind...
(Continue to next section)
 [Stealth] (Launch a sneak attack on Elodie while she's distracted.)
(If the card drawn is less than 15)

Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 12.ogg Elodie: Did you think I was blind? ...Tsk! Gardemeks, get 'em!
(If the card drawn is greater than or equal to 15)

Without waiting for Elodie to finish her threats, you and Lynette strike as one...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 24.ogg Elodie: Ugh... What...!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 25.ogg Elodie: Hey! Don't do anything stupid... Gardes... Gardemeks—
Before Elodie can finish giving her command, she is subdued by you and Lynette after sneaking up on her from behind.
(Continue to next section)
(While fighting the Gardemeks, if any dialogue check was failed)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918701 chevreuse 02.ogg Chevreuse: Not good! She's trying to escape... We need to end this fight as soon as possible!
(After defeating all Gardemeks)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 elodie 01.ogg Elodie: Busted so quickly, huh? Good thing I've already bought enough time to escape...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 elodie 02.ogg Elodie: ...Argh!
As Elodie begins to believe that she may have finally made it, she is knocked out by a hard blow from behind...
(Continue to next section)

Bonnie: —Mrrow!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: Phew... So I was right, after all. It's easier to deal with the person causing the problem than the problem itself.
 And what about that device she had?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: This is it... Looks like it's just a toy.
 (So, she really was just bluffing...)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 01.ogg Lyney: Guess that's probably why she suddenly flipped and knocked out Bernard. He probably knew that there were no explosives at the Society.
 She also pretended like she had a villainous breakdown...
 As if she had no choice but to kill to escape her life.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: ...Well, given that she never even showed her face to Bernard and Pierre, I had my doubts that she'd have gone to the Society in person to plant explosives.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 chevreuse 01.ogg Chevreuse: Thank you for your help, everyone. I'll take them back for thorough questioning, and find someone better to take over the Humane Society. I might need a few statements from everybody... Would you be able to come with me?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: Er, if statements are all you need... Can Lyney provide them on my behalf?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: I still need to go back and explain some things to the crew... I also had an appointment with (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), before we got interrupted.
 You mean... when you said I could stop by your place?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: Ah, so you do remember. Yes, I invited you to come over to our place.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: ...Once I'm done talking with the troupe, I'll make a nice cup of tea, and bring Bonnie to wait for you outside of my door.
Bonnie: Meow!
 Oh... Seems I already forgot...
(-1 heart)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: A lot has happened since then... I'm referring to when I invited you over for some tea and also to spend some time with Bonnie.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: ...Once I'm done talking with the troupe, I'll make a nice cup of tea, and bring Bonnie to wait for you outside of my door....Once I'm done talking with the troupe, I'll make a nice cup of tea, and bring Bonnie to wait for you outside of my door.Actual Voice Over: ...Once I'm done talking with the troupe, I'll take Bonnie home and make a nice cup of tea. You'll be able to find us outside of my door.
Bonnie: Meow!
 [Contemplation] What did she say again...

(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (I remember that when we parted ways at the Steambird yesterday, she mentioned something about having tea together at her place... But we were interrupted by Elodie and the others.)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: Ah, so you do remember. Yes, I invited you to come over to our place.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: ...Once I'm done talking with the troupe, I'll make a nice cup of tea, and bring Bonnie to wait for you outside of my door.
Bonnie: Meow!
(Talk to Lyney, optional)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 02.ogg Lyney: Lynette must have spent a record-breaking amount of time in serious mode today. I can't remember the last time I've seen her like that... Could it be because of a special someone?
 There are still a few things I'm curious about...
 How did Pierre get recruited into the scheme?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 03.ogg Lyney: Hmm... Based on information that we found before, Imitation Sinthe was first circulated on a small scale in Fontaine, before becoming a large-scale smuggling scheme.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 04.ogg Lyney: I'd assume that the first offerings of Imitation Sinthe came from what Pierre made in his early days, but since he was not experienced with running a clandestine operation, he was soon discovered by Garde Elodie.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 05.ogg Lyney: Elodie saw the opportunity to make a great profit in his work and perhaps even the chance of making a new life for herself, so she decided to cover his tracks...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 06.ogg Lyney: She started writing to him in Bernard's name, using what evidence she had compiled and the promise of enormous profits to blackmail him into cooperating with her.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 07.ogg Lyney: Unfortunately for her, she ran into Lynette. Even though my sister doesn't like to focus too much on a regular day, "serious mode" Lynette is one of the most perceptive people I've ever known.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 08.ogg Lyney: ...Still, all of that thinking really saps her energy. I need to go give some statements on her behalf, so I'll leave the recharging to you.
(Talk to Chevreuse, optional)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 chevreuse 02.ogg Chevreuse: You can leave the rest of this to me — the other Gardes will be joining me shortly. Don't worry, they won't have another chance to escape.
 There are still a few things I'm curious about...
 How did Elodie get her hands on the raw materials?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 chevreuse 03.ogg Chevreuse: Hmm... The materials have many other regular uses outside of being used to make Imitation Sinthe, so they're not immediately subject to being confiscated or destroyed.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 chevreuse 04.ogg Chevreuse: The harbor would usually just seize them for some time while the customs paperwork is filled out and approved. If approved, they'd be let through, and if not, they'd be returned to sender. Elodie probably used her position to replace a portion of the shipment with something else before sending the whole shipment back to sender.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 chevreuse 05.ogg Chevreuse: Given that the foreign merchants who sent in the shipments were probably working with her in the first place, they likely just never reported the difference in what they sent and what they received.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918703 chevreuse 06.ogg Chevreuse: We will, of course, continue to investigate the rest of the details of this case. Now that we've caught Elodie, figuring out the whole scheme should just be a matter of time.

Robogirl's Rest and Relaxation[]
 Step DescriptionNow that the case has been solved, it's time to keep you original appointment.

(Approach Lynette)
Media:vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 01.ogg Lynette: Mmm... Black tea and a cute kitty. Truly, the best combo for standby mode.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 02.ogg Lynette: Want some?
 A cup of tea, please.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 03.ogg Lynette: Mhm. I hope you'll like it.
 About Elodie's case...
 Are you not interested in any follow-up developments from it?
 A cute kitty, please.
Bonnie: Meow~
Media:vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 04.ogg Lynette: ...Ah, I see she's already starting to snuggle up to you.
 About Elodie's case...
 Are you not interested in any follow-up developments from it?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 05.ogg Lynette: Not at all. Information is indeed very important, but if you were to try to collect every piece of information you come across, your efficiency would actually decrease.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 06.ogg Lynette: Plus, if you just think about it... What sounds more fun? Writing a statement, or enjoying a tea party?
 The tea party.
 The cute kitty.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 07.ogg Lynette: Great answer. That'd be my pick, too.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 08.ogg Lynette: Had we not run into that case, we could have spent the entire day like this. But now, I'm running low on both time and energy...
 The key isn't how long you spend in standby mode.
 With quality time, you should be able to recharge more quickly.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 09.ogg Lynette: ...You are right, I can sense it. I'm recharging very quickly at the moment.
 I still have a question, though.
 When did you start to suspect Elodie?
Media:vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 10.ogg Lynette: Hmm, something about her rubbed me the wrong way since the very beginning. But, to be more precise... it was probably around the time when I saw Bonnie try to get away from her.
 After you arrested Bernard?
 Back then, Elodie tried to get close to Bonnie...
Bonnie: Meow~
Media:vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 11.ogg Lynette: Elodie tried to get close, but Bonnie deliberately dodged her. Maybe Bonnie had tried to evade her before at Pierre's base... or perhaps Bonnie just instinctively knew that she wasn't a good person.
Media:vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 12.ogg Lynette: Not everyone who like cats is a good person... But if cats like you, you're probably alright.
 Hmm, fair enough!
Media:vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 13.ogg Lynette: Humans tend to overthink things, but cats rely on their instincts, and they're pretty sharp. I mean, just look at Bonnie...
Media:vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 14.ogg Lynette: ...She took a liking to you the moment you met.
Bonnie: Meow!

 Quest DescriptionAs you walk through Inazuma City, you feel a strange gaze from somewhere around you.
A Mysterious Gaze[]

(Go to the city)
Thoughts: (Huh?)
(The camera zooms on Sayu, who disappears from Traveler's sight)
Thoughts: (Was that... Sayu? What's she doing running around here?)
Thoughts: (Let's go follow her, maybe we can find out what's going on.)

(Chase Sayu)
Thoughts: (She's nowhere to be seen...)
Thoughts: (We saw her only a moment ago, she couldn't have gone too far off.)
Thoughts: (Perhaps she's using her ninjutsu skills to hide. Hmm, let's have a look around the area.)

(Observe the box crates)
Observe: (This appears to be just an ordinary pile of junk. Someone will likely come by to clean it up soon.)
(Observe the barrels)
Observe: (There doesn't seem to be anything of particular interest here, let's go have a look somewhere else.)
(Observe crates and barrels)
Observe: (Nope, she doesn't seem to be around here.)

(Observe the "barrel")
Observe: (Hm? What's that strange-looking thing?)
(The "barrel" transforms into Sayu)
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Aw, you saw right through my disguise...
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Odd... Even the shrine maiden often struggles to find me.
 Well, if your tail wasn't sticking out...
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Huh? My tail was sticking out!?
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: *sigh* I must have been too nervous and failed to fully utilize my ninjutsu technique.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: So, uh, what do you need?
 I was about to ask you the same thing.
 Weren't you looking for me just now?
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Well, uh... I heard that Shimura's added a delicious new dish to their menu.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: And Yae Publishing House has some good light novels... Oh, and a dip in Aisa Bathhouse is always nice.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: So uh, you know...
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: Today's weather is perfect for... all that stuff.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: ...So, what can I do for you?
 ...What's the real reason?
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: No really, I'm not up to anything. I'm just a little tired and thought I could use a good nap.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: I'll be going now. Don't bother chasing me again, you won't be able to catch me anyway.
 I suppose I'll just have a chat with the shrine maiden, then.
 Perhaps I'll tell Kamisato Ayaka that I ran into you here.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: Oh no, anything but that!
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: *sigh* You're just as difficult as the shrine maiden. C'mon just let me go, would you.
 Then I expect you to answer honestly.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: Oh, fine. But if I tell you the truth, I don't wanna hear any complaints, no matter how crazy the truth may seem.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: So you know I'm in the Shuumatsuban, right? Well, it's our job to take care of matters that are "inconvenient" to the higher-ups.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Which sometimes includes ambushing people.
 I see. Go on...
 Ambushing, huh? That's sticky business.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: Huh? Doesn't that intimidate you even a little bit?
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 19.ogg Sayu: You do know what that means, right? And still no reaction, huh? Don't tell me it's because of my height.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 20.ogg Sayu: Anyway, being ambushed is pretty scary. You should at least try to express a little concern.
 But I'm not your target, right?
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 21.ogg Sayu: Uh actually, according to my orders, you are... Though I have no intention of really attacking you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 22.ogg Sayu: I don't get it, they never assign me this kind of mission. There's loads of other suitable operatives.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 23.ogg Sayu: All this craziness is starting to interfere with my sleep schedule. I just dropped by to see how you were doing. I was glad to see that you're okay.
 But why all the running? And what's with all those lame excuses just now?
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 24.ogg Sayu: I was worried about how you'd react...
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 25.ogg Sayu: I mean, who knows what you'd do if you knew that I was out to ambush you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 26.ogg Sayu: Yet, when I told you, you didn't so much as flinch. I guess that actually made me feel a lot better.
 Well, you were a great help to us before. What's really concerning is whatever's behind these orders of yours.
 I want to ask around and get to the bottom of this.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 27.ogg Sayu: Who do you want to talk to? Someone in the Yashiro Commission?
 Who is the "shrine maiden" you mentioned earlier?
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 28.ogg Sayu: She's the one who's been assigned to supervise my work. She always tries to catch me whenever I'm slacking off. Basically, it's her duty to keep me from napping.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 29.ogg Sayu: But... she would probably know more about the origins of my mission.
 Then let's go ask her about it.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 30.ogg Sayu: Fine... I'll take you to her, but I'll have to hide somewhere in the distance. If she catches me anywhere near there, I'll never hear the end of it.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 31.ogg Sayu: And then they'll sentence me to all kinds of work, which'll really cut into my time for napping.
 Don't worry, I understand. Let's go.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 32.ogg Sayu: Please, she's quite perceptive. You mustn't tell her that you've seen me anywhere.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 33.ogg Sayu: You got that? We have a deal, no word about me."

Shuumatsuban Visitation?[]

(Ask Kano Nana)
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: *sigh* Where has she run off to this time...
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 02.ogg Kano Nana: Hm? I didn't expect to see you here. You're (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), right? It's a pleasure to meet you.
 Do you know me?
 Oh, you've heard of me?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 03.ogg Kano Nana: Yes, Miss Kamisato has spoken of you before. You seemed familiar. It appears my intuitions were correct.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 04.ogg Kano Nana: May I ask what brings you here?
 I happened to be in the area. Do you come here often?
 It seems you are looking for something.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 05.ogg Kano Nana: It just so happens I'm looking for a little child by the name of Sayu.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 06.ogg Kano Nana: She's a ninja with a nasty habit of disappearing the moment I turn around. *sigh* She's always neglectful of her duties.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 07.ogg Kano Nana: She often comes here to take a nap, but it seems she's already predicted that I would come looking for her.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 08.ogg Kano Nana: You haven't happened to see her anywhere, have you? She's wearing a mujina costume, pretty hard to miss.
 Uh, no... No, I haven't.
 No.
 No, of course not.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 09.ogg Kano Nana: Really?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 10.ogg Kano Nana: Well then, I suppose I'll just have to keep searching for her.
 By the way, I've caught word that the Yashiro Commission has supposedly dispatched someone to ambush me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 11.ogg Kano Nana: Oh? How could that be?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 12.ogg Kano Nana: How did you catch wind of this? Did you encounter the ninja tasked with the matter?
 No, I've just... heard things.
 I've just got an unusual feeling that someone's following me.
 Someone informed me that this might be happening. I've been on my guard.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 13.ogg Kano Nana: Huh... Well, I'm sure there's no need to worry. You're probably just overthinking things.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 14.ogg Kano Nana: After all, you have been of great service to the Yashiro Commission and many are thankful for your actions. How could anyone even consider dispatching a ninja to attack you?
 Is it possible that a ninja could have gone rogue? You know, a ninja like Sayu...
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 15.ogg Kano Nana: Like Sayu? You mean to say that this matter is related to Sayu?
 No, not at all. I'm just making an example, that's all.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 16.ogg Kano Nana: There's absolutely no need to worry about Sayu. If anything, she's extremely loyal and would never act presumptuously.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 17.ogg Kano Nana: Though she often neglects her duties as a ninja and seems to never heed instructions, she's certainly not one to go against our principles.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 18.ogg Kano Nana: Given her age, such portentous tasks are not assigned to her.
 (Of course Sayu wouldn't hurt me...)
 (What a relief...)
 (But doesn't that just make Sayu even more suspicious?)
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 19.ogg Kano Nana: What's the matter? Are you still worried?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 20.ogg Kano Nana: Alright, just to be sure, I shall personally inquire about this matter with the Yashiro Commission.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 21.ogg Kano Nana: Though I am the shrine maiden, it is also part of my duties to take on work from the Shuumatsuban.
 Thank you, that would certainly help.
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 While you are making inquiries, I shall continue investigating on my own, just to be safe.
(Proceed to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 22.ogg Kano Nana: I'll be sure to look into it. I'm curious myself what could be the cause of such absurd rumors.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 23.ogg Kano Nana: My intuition tells me that Sayu's mischief might be behind this whole misunderstanding.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 24.ogg Kano Nana: Are you completely certain that you haven't seen her around recently?
 Yes, absolutely certain.
 (Seems there's no fooling her...)
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 25.ogg Kano Nana: Hmm...
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 26.ogg Kano Nana: Aha! Sayu, I can see you. Come out from there!
 (Don't tell me she left her tail sticking out again!)
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 27.ogg Kano Nana: Don't even think about trying to sneak away. Come over here, this instant!
Seeing Sayu walk up gloomily, Kano Nana understands what going on.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 28.ogg Kano Nana: Hmm, it does appear that Sayu has really been given a mission to ambush you... Which wasn't assigned by me, of course.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 29.ogg Kano Nana: I apologize, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). I'm afraid I did not treat this matter with due sincerity.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 30.ogg Kano Nana: I shall take these orders back to the Yashiro Commission for further clarification.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Good... Well if there's nothing left for me to do then I'll be...
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 31.ogg Kano Nana: Ahem! Sayu!
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Oh, uh, y—yes!
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 32.ogg Kano Nana: Where do you think you're off to? You have ninjutsu training to complete, so you shall return with me to Chinju Forest.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Yes, but you know, an exceptional ninja must not only work hard, but also have ample rest. *yawn* It happens to be time for my nap, so I'll see you next time... Goodbye and good night.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 33.ogg Kano Nana: You're coming with me, even if I have to carry you, Sayu. Is that what you want?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: Oh, n—no need. I'm sorry, I'll come quietly.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: In which case... (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), will you come with us, too?
 Why?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: I promise there won't be any trouble. I need a bit of your time, that's all.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: I helped you by bringing you to the shrine maiden, so now you need to return the favor.
 Alright, fine.
 Good thing we didn't have any other plans.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 34.ogg Kano Nana: Ugh... I honestly hope you are not up to something again, Sayu.
(Proceed to Give It Up!)

Branch 2[]

Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 35.ogg Kano Nana: Yes, of course. I'm sorry that this matter has taken up so much of your time. I'll be sure to look into it and get back to you as soon as possible.
Kano Nana leaves.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: Whew, that was close. Thanks for not ratting me out.
 Good thing you didn't fall asleep.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: Hey, even I find it hard to sleep through a tense moment like that.
 So we know that Kano Nana isn't behind your mission, is there anyone else you can think of?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Hmm, I don't know where else to start...
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: Oh, but there is one official guy who is responsible for delivering orders from the Yashiro Commission to the Shuumatsuban. Anyone with missions like this will report directly to him.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: But I never receive those kind of missions, so I've hardly ever spoken to him before.
 That makes him a likely suspect.
 Maybe there's a way we can get his attention?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: Oh, so what should I do?
 Just pretend that you've already finished the job.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: Huh!? B—But, I can't do that... I mean, I—I can't even squish an Onikabuto, there's no way I...
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: Oh wait, you said pretend, didn't you? You almost scared my tail off... But even so, I'm a lousy liar...
 Don't worry, I'll give you some hair and other evidence to report back with.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Oh, I get it. We'll take the evidence, stuff it in a bag, and write my name on it. Then, all I need to do is put it in the big box used for reports and wait for him to see it. I'm sure he'll come looking for me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: *yawn* But that's a lot to do, and it's really far away.
 Hey, you have to help me out here.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: Oh fine, I guess my nap will have to wait till later. Just stay put, okay? I'll be back in no time.
After a while, Sayu finally returns.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 19.ogg Sayu: *panting* I finally made it back.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 20.ogg Sayu: Your evidence caught his attention right away. He gave me a different location to meet him up later. Strange, why wouldn't we just meet at the Police Station?
 Maybe he's up to something.
 That's even more suspicious.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 21.ogg Sayu: Let's go to the meeting point, I want to settle this quickly so I can finally curl up for a nice, long nap.
(Proceed to Shuumatsuban Suspicions)

Solution: First activate the mechanism surrounded by three torches, then the one with one torch, then the one with two torches.
Help Bennett open the treasure chest
Gameplay Notes[]
The order of the mechanisms to activate for the final puzzle is based on the placement of the torches around the mechanism.
The smaller 3×3 pattern around the mechanism with one torch shows the position of the first mechanism to activate in the larger 3×3 grid.
The pattern around the mechanism with two torches shows the first position as well as the position of the second mechanism to activate.
The pattern around the mechanism with three torches shows the first two positions as well as the position of the third mechanism to activate.
Solving the puzzle without making any mistakes will give the player the Memories of the Heart achievement The Power of Luck.

 Quest DescriptionAn adventurer requires naught but courage and strength. The two of you prepare to head directly to the Deserted Ruins of Eya.
Expansive Eya[]

(Talk to Bennett after entering the ruins)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904501 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: It feels pretty ordinary here... I was expecting some kind of sense of impending doom.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904501 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Could it be that because you're here with me, I'm feeling more at ease? Hehe...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904501 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: I've caught the scent of treasure in the air! Come on, let's go!

(Talk to Bennett after following him into the next room)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: This room's setup seems to be somewhat tricky.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: The things that stand out are the two mechanisms in front of us, one on the left, and one on the right.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: But... it seems like there's some sort of danger lurking around the mechanisms...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: If my years of adventure experience are anything to go by, it would be a disaster if we activated the wrong mechanism, haha.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: How about letting me try it out first?
 Go ahead! We won't get anywhere just staring at them. (This dialogue option leads to Ending: No Wonder It's a Top-Class Commission.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: Hehe, leave it to me.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: Ah, but as you know, I really don't have any luck.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: So I'll leave it to you to decide which of these two mechanisms we should trigger.
 The one on the left.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: That's the one I was thinking of too! Let's see...
 The one on the right.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: Actually I was thinking of the one on the left, so maybe that means that the one on the right must be the correct one. Let me see...
???: *clicking sounds*
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 11.ogg Bennett: What was that noise...?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 12.ogg Bennett: Oh no! It looks like all the exits are blocked! Guess I still managed to get the wrong one.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 13.ogg Bennett: This... this is really bad...

Ending: No Wonder It's a Top-Class Commission



No Wonder It's a Top-Class Commission


Aether
Lumine







As expected of an A-rank commission! One misstep and we're stuck in here!

 Hmm, how can I let you face the danger alone? (This dialogue option leads to Ending: Fortunate Outcome.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 14.ogg Bennett: Hmm... I could try it out myself...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 15.ogg Bennett: But... What do you think we should do? Let's do it your way!
 Take one each, activate them simultaneously.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 16.ogg Bennett: Well, that's a possibility... yeah.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 17.ogg Bennett: Let's try it then! I'll take the right side, you take the left!

Media:vo bntcop001 1904505 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Go stand by the mechanism, and when we're both ready, let's trigger them!

(After activating the mechanism)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904507 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Cooool! The door is open. We got it right!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904507 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Good thing we went with your idea. You definitely live up to your reputation.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904507 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: And... I haven't had this feeling of working together with friends in ages. I've really missed it, hehe.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904507 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: Anyway, let's move on!

(Talk to Bennett after following him into the next room)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Oh... so this room has...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: ...Four mechanisms. Which means...
 We need four people...
 Two of us won't be enough...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: That's what I'm thinking, based on the last room...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: I think we're gonna need four people to trigger all the mechanisms at the same time.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: Ahhh... If only the rest of Benny's Adventure Team were here...
 What's the deal with Benny's Adventure Team, anyway?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: ...I hate to admit it, but the truth is... it's gone. It remains in name alone.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: The only reason Katheryne hasn't deregistered "Benny's Adventure Team" is because she took pity on me.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: In fact... *sigh* the number of adventurers on the team has been below the registration requirements for a long time already.
 You mean... you're the only one left?
 All the other members are gone?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: Haha... yeah. Royce, Heckler, and Jack were all members of Benny's Adventure Team.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: A lot of things went down, but mostly it ended because of my bad luck.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 11.ogg Bennett: I completely understand why they quit the team. I'd never want to put them in danger on my account. *sigh*
 Don't take it personally.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 12.ogg Bennett: Yeah, I felt really let down at first, but I'm pretty much used to it now. It's okay!
 They're all traitors. (−1 Heart)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 13.ogg Bennett: Heh, don't say that! Adventurers should be free to do what they please, so leaving an adventure team is a completely normal thing to do.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 14.ogg Bennett: Even though I'm the only one left on Benny's Adventure Team... One day, I'm gonna make sure its name is known all over Teyvat!
 You can do it, Bennett!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 15.ogg Bennett: Hehe, thank you.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 16.ogg Bennett: Let's focus on the problem at hand...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 17.ogg Bennett: Ah, sorry, the thought of the adventure team got me all sentimental.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 18.ogg Bennett: Now that I think about it more carefully... Maybe we're making too many assumptions about the solution to these mechanisms.
 You mean, the solution may be different from the previous room?
 You're right, we shouldn't jump to conclusions.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 19.ogg Bennett: Exactly. Okay, I'll take a quick look at these mechanisms while you look around for any other clues.

(Investigating the first clue)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904508 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: There doesn't seem to be anything here...
(Investigating the second clue)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904508 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's so dusty. Paimon bets no one has been here in a long, long time.
(Investigating the third clue)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904508 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hey that looks like a notebook!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904508 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Let's grab it and check it out with Bennett, shall we?
(Obtain  Lost Adventure Notebook)

(Talking to Bennett)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: An adventurer's notebook? What's it doing here...?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Maybe it's got some clues on how to crack these mechanisms! Shall we take a look?
(Opens the Lost Adventure Notebook)

"Eric can't hold on any longer... We had no choice but to give up. I'll leave this notebook here. Maybe this treasure is destined for someone else.
As you may have noticed, the mechanism installed by the door needs someone operating it constantly. Otherwise, the other mechanisms cannot be operated.
But there's a catch...
The person operating the mechanism by the door takes on an enormous risk.
If the other mechanisms are operated in the wrong sequence, that person will face...
One other word of advice:
The number or torches does not indicate the sequence of operation... We made that mistake, and paid a painful price. Perhaps... the order has something to do with the position of the torches on the ground?
What is the answer?
Oh, how I wish to know...
But Eric physically can't take any more..."
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: Whoa... It really does have some information about them.
 It's some very valuable guidance.
 Why do I feel... it's a bit ominous?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: It seems that the writer is holding something back.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: Well, since they've placed their hopes on future adventurers, we can't let them down.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: The notes say that the mechanism at the entrance needs to be controlled by someone continuously...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: But if the mechanisms are activated in the wrong sequence, the person in charge of the mechanism at the entrance will...
 Get hurt?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: Yeah, I guess that's what the notes are referring to when they say... "Eric can't hold on anymore"...
 ...Die?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: Uh... You think so!? Surely it can't be that bad!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: It says in the notes that Eric "can't hold on anymore." That at least proves that it is possible to "hold on" up to a point.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 11.ogg Bennett: Anyway, I'll take that role.
 Who says it's up to you?
 We should at least to rock, paper, scissors...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 12.ogg Bennett: Haha, it's okay, it's okay. Getting injured is just part of my daily routine.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 13.ogg Bennett: I'm pretty used to it by now. At the very least, I should be able to last longer than this Eric guy, haha.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 14.ogg Bennett: And more importantly, I trust you!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 15.ogg Bennett: You can definitely crack this mechanism puzzle, right? I mean come on! You're the great adventurer that I've always admired.
 Bennett...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 16.ogg Bennett: Alright, alright, let's just focus on solving these mechanisms!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 17.ogg Bennett: Remember what the notes say... Hmm...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 18.ogg Bennett: "The number of torches is not the hint for the activation sequence..."
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 19.ogg Bennett: "Perhaps... the sequence is related to the position of the torches on the ground."
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 20.ogg Bennett: Well, don't put too much pressure on yourself just because you're afraid I'll get hurt!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 21.ogg Bennett: Just go with your gut and do it.

(The first time you fail)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Ow! Argh... it's okay, it's okay. If this is as bad as it gets, I can handle it.
(The second time you fail)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Ah! *cough* *cough* I'm fine... don't let me influence your... thinking...
(If you fail thrice)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: Ugh... is it over yet... I think I...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: I'm... sorry...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: I don't think my body... can... take this anymore...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: I'm sorry... I failed you... (−5 Hearts)
Hangout Event EndedJourney Over

(After completing the puzzle)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: You... you solved it?
 Yeah, piece of cake.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: Haha! That's the great adventurer I'm talking about! Awesome!
 All thanks to you, Bennett. (+1 Heart)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: Oh! Uh... heh, I didn't really do anything. You're the one who nailed this.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: Let's go and open the chest, shall we? I can't wait!

(Open the Luxurious Chest)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Wow, that was quite a haul!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: This must be the proudest moment for any adventurer!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: Not only getting the chest, but having this golden opportunity to join you on an adventure. For me, that's a pretty major treasure already, hehe...
 The feeling is mutual.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: Really! Then I'm honored, haha.
 The chest is the most important thing here.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: Hmm... I guess you're right, finding chests is where the real romance of being an adventurer lies!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: But there's one other thing that I find the most amazing of all...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: The fact that nothing really bad happened to us this whole adventure. This is the first time in my whole adventure career that it's ever turned out this way!
 This is just one of the many possible outcomes.
 But it shows that fortunate outcomes do exist.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: That sounds very deep... but I think I get what you're saying.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: You are saying that no matter how unlucky I might be, there will always be times when luck is on my side, right?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: Yeah... This is a really big thing for me.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 11.ogg Bennett: And you know, I have a feeling that...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 12.ogg Bennett: ...It was your kindness and goodwill towards me that helped me avoid a lot of bad luck... even find a little good luck...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 13.ogg Bennett: Hehe, it's a bit embarrassing to say that out loud, but all in all, thank you... for everything!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 14.ogg Bennett: I hope I get to go on another adventure with you soon!

 Quest DescriptionAccording to the schedule, the first thing you need to do is wake Ningguang up...

(After knocking on the door)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Yes, I'm already awake.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: I'll be out in a moment. I'm just changing.

(Ningguang comes out of her room)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: Good morning. Did you sleep well?
 I was so excited I couldn't sleep.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: Oh, how strange — me too! ...I'm joking, of course — I slept like a baby. Sorry to disappoint you.
 The same as usual.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: That's good. I was worried you'd be a little uncomfortable.
 I was a little nervous.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: There's nothing to worry about. We just need to go through the schedule you made and tick the items off one by one.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: Now then. The schedule. Let's see what you have for me today.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Item 1... Lunch at Liuli Pavilion with Ms. Luo Qiao.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: Ah yes, I remember the invitation. I need to make sure I'm well-prepared for this.
 Is she a friend of yours?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: No. Someone I've never met before. Today's lunch will be our first time meeting each other.
 It's just lunch, what exactly do you need to prepare?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: Hehe, she's paying a high price for my time, and I intend to make sure she gets her money's worth.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: Otherwise... tens of millions of Mora is rather a high price for lunch, even one at Liuli Pavilion — wouldn't you say?
 ...Tens of millions!?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: That's right. Even at this price, there is no shortage of people willing to pay for a lunch opportunity with me.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: To be clear, I've never had any hand in setting the price. I, too, was rather surprised to see it become so expensive.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: Time is very valuable to me. So when I first came up with the idea, I made a rule that my time would go to the highest bidder.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 16.ogg Ningguang: Gradually, it developed into a lucrative business.
 It's like... an investment.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 17.ogg Ningguang: Yes, that sums it up very well. Most people looking to buy my time are businesspeople who believe that whatever they spend now, they will make back several times over in due course.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 18.ogg Ningguang: Naturally, for anyone looking to make a profit in a complex market, the bottom line is having the requisite experience and expertise. All I can do for them is share whatever insight I may have.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 19.ogg Ningguang: As for how much my insight is worth in terms of Mora, everyone has their own idea. There is no standardized way to measure something like this.
 So this is how rich people think.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 20.ogg Ningguang: You are a very lucky person, you know. You get to sit in on this lunch for free.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 21.ogg Ningguang: In the hands of a professional businessperson, the kind of information you will be exposed to would be worth... well, tens of millions of Mora.
 Then I will listen and learn.
 Then this could be literally the most valuable lesson I'll learn in my life.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913201 ningguang 22.ogg Ningguang: There's no need to be nervous, of course. Now, let's have some breakfast before we leave.

(Talk to Ningguang)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Did you organize this entire breakfast?
 I just picked the time slot.
 I think maybe Baishi arranged it yesterday...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Haha. I know what's going on, then.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: Please, sit. Have a taste of the Jade Chamber chef's cooking. This kind of food tastes far less satisfying if left out for too long.
 Thank you.
You and Ningguang enjoy a fine breakfast.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: What do you think? Is the food to your liking?
 I ate so much more than I intended to...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: Hehe. Don't forget we have a lunch later. Save some space, or you might miss out on some even better food.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: Still, I'm happy to see that you approve of my culinary tastes.
 Do you usually eat breakfast with your secretaries?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: On occasion. Usually, everyone is too busy for a leisurely sit-down meal. There is an awful lot to get done most of the time.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Breakfast also isn't usually so lavish. Hence my surprise when we got here.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: I actually thought you had cooked it all yourself...
 I mean, I'm not a terrible chef, but still...
 I don't know if my cooking is really to your tastes.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: Relax, I'm just joking. Baishi probably made arrangements yesterday to add a few extra dishes to the breakfast menu.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: You willingly took this work on, knowing that it would be tedious, and you have worked diligently. My secretaries and I are very grateful to you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: Treating you to some food is but a small token of our appreciation.
 Mmm. Not bad, not bad at all.
 It was as good as Xinyue Kiosk and Liuli Pavilion.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: Breakfast sets the tone for the rest of the day. You can't compromise on it.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: If you wake up to the same monotonous meal each day, you will start to feel fatigued even before you start working.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: Well, I'm done eating. We should get ready, then head off to Liuli Pavilion.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 16.ogg Ningguang: I have some preparations to make first. Could you bring my clothes to my room, please?
 You need a change of clothes?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 17.ogg Ningguang: I need a change of mood, and a change of clothes will facilitate that.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 18.ogg Ningguang: Who knows, perhaps you will have a completely different impression of me after I change outfits.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 19.ogg Ningguang: I already instructed Lanyang to have my outfit ready. You can fetch it from her.
 Understood.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913202 ningguang 20.ogg Ningguang: Thank you. I'll be in my room.

(Look for Lanyang to get the tailored clothes)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 lanyang 01.ogg Lanyang: Hello, how may I help?
 I'm here to fetch a change of clothes for Ningguang.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 lanyang 02.ogg Lanyang: Ah yes, of course. Please wait a moment, I'll go and get them.
After a long wait, Lanyang finally returns.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 lanyang 03.ogg Lanyang: Here you are. Please give this to Lady Ningguang.
 That seemed to take you a while.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 lanyang 04.ogg Lanyang: Yes, this whole room is full of Lady Ningguang's personal items. Not just clothes, either — there are all kinds of jewelry and ornaments...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 lanyang 05.ogg Lanyang: Lady Ningguang asked us to rearrange this room recently. We're currently right in the middle of that, so everything's in a bit of a mess. That's why it took me a little time to find this for you.
 (Sounds like Ningguang has a huge personal collection...)
 (I suppose this is a problem unique to rich people.)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 lanyang 06.ogg Lanyang: Anyway, you can take it now. Thanks for coming to pick it up.
(Obtain  Box of Clothes)
(Talk to Lanyang again)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 lanyang 01.ogg Lanyang: Please take this garment to Lady Ningguang. Thank you.

(Talk to Ningguang)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Did you get it. (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
(Opens submission menu)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Ah, this is the one. Please wait for a moment.
After a while, the door in front of you finally opens.
(Ningguang is wearing the Orchid's Evening Gown outfit.)
(If this is the first time the player encountered Ningguang wearing this outfit)

Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: I had this specially tailored recently — and I must say, I am really rather fond of it.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: What do you think? Be honest. I just want to know your first impression.
(If the player has encountered Ningguang wear this outfit before)

Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: I believe you've seen this outfit before. It's one of my favorites.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: I don't think I asked you what you thought of it at the time, though. What do you think? Be honest.
 It suits you.
 It's stunning.
 It's classy.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: Phew... Thank you. I was actually a little nervous.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: Knowing that it has your seal of approval makes me feel much more self-confident.
 Self-confident?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: If you're second-guessing how you look, you can forget about looking glamorous — even the finest garments in the world will look out of place on you.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: That's why your affirmation matters so much to me.
 Really, you look great in anything.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Hah, then it's mere flattery... You pick your moments to wisecrack, don't you? Now I don't know whether to take what you said earlier seriously...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: I never knew you had such a mischievous side.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913203 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: All right. Let's head to Liuli Pavilion.

The Grand Banquet[]
 Quest DescriptionAfter making the preparations, you and Ningguang go to attend the banquet. The other party is a merchant who has spent a great sum of Mora to buy some of her time.

(Talk to Hongru before the meal)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913206 hongru 01.ogg Hongru: Everything is set, please enjoy your meal.
(Going to Liuli Pavilion and talking to Luo Qiao)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 01.ogg Luo Qiao: Lady Ningguang!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 02.ogg Luo Qiao: No, no, not at all! I know that you have a thousand different things to do each day. I'm very grateful for any amount of time you can spare for me.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: Great. Well, let's leave the formalities aside from now on, and make this just a friendly chat.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 04a.ogg Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 04b.ogg Ningguang: This is (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). I'm assuming you've heard of (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍).
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 05a.ogg Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 05b.ogg Ningguang: (‍HeHeText for male Traveler/SheSheText for female Traveler‍) happened to be in Liyue Harbor today, so I invited (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) to come along. It's a rare opportunity to dine with (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍), too.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 06a.ogg Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 06b.ogg Ningguang: Do you mind if (‍heheText for male Traveler/shesheText for female Traveler‍) sits with us?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 03.ogg Luo Qiao: No, not at all! On the contrary, I'm honored — what a surprise to be dining with the illustrious Traveler, too!
 (Huh, I thought she'd introduce me as her temporary secretary...)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 04.ogg Luo Qiao: I've always been fascinated by you and your adventures... there's so many questions I'd love to ask you!
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 05.ogg Luo Qiao: Oh, I'm sorry, where are my manners — I forgot to introduce myself. Look at me, getting all over-excited.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 06.ogg Luo Qiao: I'm Luo Qiao, a businesswoman. I work mostly in the textile business, but recently I've been considering branching out into some other markets.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 07.ogg Luo Qiao: That's what I wanted to ask Lady Ningguang for some advice about. I didn't know there'd be a surprise guest involved too.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 08.ogg Luo Qiao: Hehe, so the rumors are true, then...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: Rumors? About what, exactly?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 09.ogg Luo Qiao: You know, the rumors about the two of you, Lady Ningguang and the Traveler, having a... closer-than-average relationship.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 10.ogg Luo Qiao: ...You haven't heard?
 Nope.
 Are these rumors widespread?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 11.ogg Luo Qiao: Come on... you must know that Lady Ningguang's every move is in the spotlight? That obviously includes her relationships.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 12.ogg Luo Qiao: And if you didn't have some sort of special relationship, why would she invite you to this lunch right after finding out that you were back in Liyue Harbor?
 Um, actually...
 (I need to be very careful how I answer this...)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Haha. Interesting. Yes, we have a special relationship, but I don't see anything unusual about it.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: The Traveler is a national hero in Liyue whose actions have directly contributed toward the prosperity we enjoy today.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 10a.ogg Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 10b.ogg Ningguang: Even putting aside my official status as one of the Liyue Qixing, I admire (‍himhimText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) on a personal level, too.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 13.ogg Luo Qiao: Oh, yes, there is nothing unusual about it at all. I was just observing that Lady Ningguang now seems to have a second interesting character in her innermost circle. The first one being the captain.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: You're comparing Apples and Sunsettias there. Whenever Beidou returns to Liyue Harbor, all she brings me is a headache.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: I've missed out on a number of extremely promising investment opportunities thanks to her. In fact, the timing is always so suspiciously coincidental I can't help but wonder if she's doing it on purpose...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 14.ogg Luo Qiao: Investment opportunities... Oh, do you mean the Luminescent Spine business? I hear that's been all the rage recently.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: No, something else. All the talk around Luminescent Spines is just empty hype.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 15.ogg Luo Qiao: Oh? But isn't there some new technology from Fontaine that needs lots of Luminescent Spines to make it work?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: If it were really that profitable, those in the know would have kept it as quiet as possible. You have to wonder, if the news is spreading like wildfire, who's fanning the flames?
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: I had my secretary do some analysis. The current price of Luminescent Spines far exceeds the profits that could be made on the end product.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 16.ogg Ningguang: So I would advise you to be cautious.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 16.ogg Luo Qiao: I see... Huh, I was planning to get your opinion on how to get started in that business.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 17.ogg Ningguang: In my opinion, there are many people around with ulterior motives, making this a very risky business to enter into in the short term.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 18.ogg Ningguang: Long term, it's very difficult to say. But I believe there's too much uncertainty to make it worth your investment. You worked hard to earn every Mora you own, and you should be just as careful spending it as you were making it.
 Hit the nail on the head.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 17.ogg Luo Qiao: You think so too, huh?
 At least do your research before you part with any money.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 18.ogg Luo Qiao: Okay, got it. If that's what both of you think, I'll take my time and not rush into anything.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 19.ogg Luo Qiao: Maybe it'd be a better choice to invest this money into an industry that I'm genuinely interested in getting involved with.
The business talk continues in this vein throughout lunchtime...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 20.ogg Luo Qiao: Lady Ningguang, thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me today. I didn't know how much we'd get through, but you've answered every question I wanted to ask.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 19.ogg Ningguang: Good, I'm glad I could be of some help.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 21.ogg Luo Qiao: Now I see why you were able to become the most successful businessperson in Liyue Harbor.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 22.ogg Luo Qiao: You think clearly, you are very knowledgeable, and you keep yourself well-informed. It would take me a very long time to come anywhere close to your level.
 (This is why so many people want to pay to spend time with Ningguang...)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 20.ogg Ningguang: You've been listening for a while. Are you getting bored?
 No. I'm finding it all very interesting.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 21.ogg Ningguang: Has it sparked an interest in the business world for you?
 Maybe I'll give it a shot in the future.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 22.ogg Ningguang: Ah, so you want to be my competitor. Well then, I suppose I'll have to start looking over my shoulder.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 23.ogg Ningguang: Or how about this — I'll invest in you early on, before you make it big.
 I'm a novice, but I was able to follow because you explained everything so clearly.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 24.ogg Ningguang: That means you also have a good head on your shoulders and the ability to learn rapidly.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 25.ogg Ningguang: If you are in need of Mora, you should absolutely consider doing business.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 luoqiao 23.ogg Luo Qiao: I won't take up any more of your time. Thank you — this lunch was everything I was hoping for and more. I can't wait to try out everything I've learned.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 26.ogg Ningguang: See you next time. I'll look forward to hearing good news from you soon.

Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 27.ogg Ningguang: Right then, lunch is over. I assume you have something planned next? Although...
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 28.ogg Ningguang: I'm a little concerned about the auction. I wonder how my secretarial trio is getting along.
 Don't worry about them. They're very capable. (This dialogue option leads to Greeting Gift.)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 29.ogg Ningguang: Yes, you're right. Whatever happens, they can handle it.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 30.ogg Ningguang: In  that case, what's next on the schedule?
 Meeting up with the informants.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 31.ogg Ningguang: Ah, okay then. Yes, it's been some time since I last caught up with them.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 32.ogg Ningguang: Let's go to Mingxing Jewelry first, I need to pick up something before meeting them.
(Proceeds to Greeting Gift)
 Well, we have time to go and check up on them if you want. (This dialogue option leads to The Auction.)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 33.ogg Ningguang: Good, then let's do that. There are some slippery characters among the bidders, you see.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 34.ogg Ningguang: So even though my secretaries are very capable and experienced, I still can't help worrying for them a little.
Media:vo ngcop001 1913204 ningguang 35.ogg Ningguang: Come on. The auction is being held at Yujing Terrace.
(Proceeds to The Auction)
(Talk to Hongru after the meal)
Media:vo ngcop001 1913207 hongru 01.ogg Hongru: Thank you for your custom.

To the Shrine[]
 Quest DescriptionTo obtain the forgiveness of the Grand Narukami Shrine, Shinobu has to make a trip there.

(Talk to Yae Miko)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: Well hello there, little one. Oh? I see you've brought a special guest.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Ahem... Lady Guuji, I'm here to apologize on behalf of the Arataki Gang.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: We will remove all the flyers and compensate the shrine appropriately for any damages.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I hope Lady Guuji can forgive their appalling behavior...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: Ah, so that's why you're here... Tut-tut, yes, that is a tricky situation.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: This is the Grand Narukami Shrine, after all. Ultimately, their actions here are tantamount to disrespecting the Shogun herself...
 (That's a devilish grin...)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: So, how about this? I've already assigned a shrine maiden to clear up your little flyers, so at this moment we are a little understaffed at the shrine.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 05.ogg Yae Miko: You mentioned appropriate compensation. Perhaps you could fill in for this shrine maiden and greet visitors for the day, hmm?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I'm afraid I have to refuse.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 06.ogg Yae Miko: Oh? Such a hasty refusal. Do you think that's wise? Goodness, who knows what Tenshukaku would make of this if they heard about it...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 05.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Ugh, I can't believe it...
 Looks like you'll have to play along...
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 Never let her lead you by the nose!
(Proceed to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 Looks like you'll have to play along...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 07.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, very good. You've learned a lot since we last met.
 Otherwise, things can only get worse.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: True... I could deal with most people if they tried to exploit my weakness... just not her.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Okay. I'll be a shrine maiden for a day — but let me be clear that this is for one day only... and one time only.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 08.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Also, I'm not wearing a shrine maiden's outfit. Not happening.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 08.ogg Yae Miko: Aw, well that's a shame.
 What a pity.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 09.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Hey, not you too!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 09.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, that settles it, then. Now, there are already a few visitors at the shrine. Make sure you take good care of them.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 10.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...I know what I'm doing.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 10.ogg Yae Miko: Ooh, she marched off quickly. So cold.
 It seems that I have no business left here.
 I guess I'll be leaving now.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 11.ogg Yae Miko: Hold on now. Would you like to be a shrine maiden for a day as well?
 Are you sure I'm qualified...?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 12.ogg Yae Miko: Hah. It's my shrine. If I say you're qualified, then you're qualified.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 13.ogg Yae Miko: Besides, can you really bear the thought of leaving her here all by herself?
 Heck no, the thought terrifies me.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 14.ogg Yae Miko: Oh, don't say that. Besides, can you really bear the thought of leaving her here all by herself?
 (Shinobu of all people will be quite alright on her own.)
 (But who knows what might happen with Miko here...)
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 15.ogg Yae Miko: So you'll stay and keep her company, yes? Don't worry, you'll both receive ample compensation for your trouble.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 16.ogg Yae Miko: It'll be quite worth the wait. Especially yours, I assure you... Hehe...
(Proceed to Shrine Maiden for a Day)

Branch 2[]

 Never let her lead you by the nose!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 17.ogg Yae Miko: Oh? Dear me, don't you trust me? I'm heartbroken...
 You've clearly got some mischief planned!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 18.ogg Yae Miko: *sigh*... You're both impossible. Go on then, go lend a hand to the shrine maiden in charge of removing the flyers.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 19.ogg Yae Miko: You can have it your way. Take down all the flyers and that will be the end of it. Is that accommodating enough for you?
 Yes... suspiciously so...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 11.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I agree — this seems out of character for her...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 12.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Still, getting rid of the flyers should be the Arataki Gang's responsibility.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 13.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Even if there's a catch to this, it can't be as bad as being a shrine maiden for the day...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 14.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Thanks for sticking with me this far, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). You can leave the rest to me...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 20.ogg Yae Miko: Do we have an agreement? Well then. No backing out now.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 21.ogg Yae Miko: The shrine maiden I tasked with cleaning up is just outside the shrine. You'll know her when you see her.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 22.ogg Yae Miko: She is your sister, after all.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 15.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Miyuki!?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 yaemiko 23.ogg Yae Miko: Let's leave it there, shall we? Work hard, now, hehe...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 16.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Huh... so she still got me in the end.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 17.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I hate to have to do this, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), but... please stick with me for a little longer.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 18.ogg Kuki Shinobu: ...Also, as of right now, you're "Chief Advisor of the Arataki Gang."
 About your sister...
 Chief Advisor?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 19.ogg Kuki Shinobu: I'm sorry, it's just... It's all a bit complicated.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914201 shinobu 20.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Ugh. C'mon, let's go outside and find her.

Dialogue[]
 Quest DescriptionDalong leaves after having been given all the popsicles, feeling most pleased. For Chongyun, these popsicles are essential to suppressing his pure-yang spirit, and so he must have some on his person at any given time. The two of you head to Wanmin Restaurant to restock.
Popsicle Emergency[]

(Approach Wanmin Restaurant)
Media:vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: ...This is bad. Chef Mao is not at the restaurant right now, and neither is Xiangling...
Media:vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: We'll have to wait till he returns... What do we do about the evil spirits?
 If it's not too difficult, I can try to make some.
Media:vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: Oh, are you a good cook?
 Making popsicles seems easy enough.
 I often cook for myself when adventuring in the wilderness.
Media:vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: Then I'll leave it to you. Thanks for your help.
 Do you know what ingredients we should use?
Media:vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: Uhh... I'm afraid all I know is that it requires water. But to imbue the effect that suppresses my yang energy, perhaps something special is required.
Media:vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: Like different plants, fruits, or herbs, for example.
Media:vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: Do you have any experience with such things?
 Let's try Mist Flower and Qingxin. (This dialogue option leads to A Cooling Mix.)
(Go to A Cooling Mix)
 Let's try Sunsettia and Valberries. (This dialogue option leads to A Sweet Mix.)
(Go to A Sweet Mix)
 Let's try Jueyun Chili and Slime Condensate. (This dialogue option leads to A Curious Mix.)
(Go to A Curious Mix)

A Cooling Mix[]

 Let's try Mist Flower and Qingxin.
Media:vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: Oh, that sounds about right.
Media:vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 11.ogg Chongyun: Coming up with the right ingredients off the top of your head like that... You most certainly are an experienced adventurer.

(Talk to Chongyun again)
Media:vo cycop001 1902406 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: Have you procured all the ingredients for the popsicles?
(Opens the submission menu)
The Travelers makes popsicles with the ingredients gathered...
Media:vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: Are they finished? Oh, they look exactly like the ones Chef Mao makes for me.
Media:vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: Let me try one.
Media:vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: *licks popsicle* Mmmm, yes...
Media:vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: ...Good, this is the right feeling. I can sense the energy calming down within me.
 These should help you keep control.
Media:vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: Thank you, Traveler, now I have lots of popsicles. Your skills are amazing!
Media:vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: If I'd known you possess such skills, we could've made more for that kid and his family.
 It'd have to be a lot more — I'm sure the kid would eat most of them and still be hungry.
Media:vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: Haha, right. But he mentioned his family is not well-off. I'd still like to help them if I can.
 But what about your search for evil spirits?
Media:vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: Exorcism is my means of helping the people of Liyue live more peaceful and happy lives.
Media:vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: If that kid really needs my help, then helping him would just be different means to the same end.
 I'll go with you.
Media:vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: Alright. I remember the kid mentioned that he was headed for Chihu Rock. Let's go find him.
(Continues with For A Child's Smile)

A Sweet Mix[]

 Let's try Sunsettia and Valberries.
Media:vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: Hmm, those do sound refreshing, but the popsicles aren't sweet.
Media:vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: ...But in case you know something I don't, I'll trust your judgment.

(Talk to Chongyun again)
Media:vo cycop001 1902407 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: Have you procured all the ingredients for the popsicles?
(Opens the submission menu)
The Travelers makes popsicles with the ingredients gathered...
Media:vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: Are they finished? Ahh... these look even tastier than my original popsicles!
Media:vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: Let me try one.
Media:vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: *licks popsicle* Mmmm, yes...
Media:vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: It tastes fruity and sweet... It's delicious!
Media:vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: But I'm afraid it's not as effective at suppressing my yang energy as Chef Mao's popsicles.
 I thought just any popsicles would do.
Media:vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: Sadly not, but in any case, these should be good enough for now.
Media:vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: These popsicles really are delicious... I bet that kid we met earlier would be thrilled to taste this flavor.
 It'd have to be a lot more — I'm sure the kid would eat most of them and still be hungry.
Media:vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: Haha, right. But he mentioned his family is not well-off. I'd still like to help them if I can.
 But what about your search for evil spirits?
Media:vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: Exorcism is my means of helping the people of Liyue live more peaceful and happy lives.

(Continues with For A Child's Smile)

A Curious Mix[]

 Let's try Jueyun Chili and Slime Condensate.
Media:vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 12.ogg Chongyun: Uh, that sounds a little... dangerous.
Media:vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 13.ogg Chongyun: But as the saying goes, "fight fire with fire." I trust your judgment.

(Talk to Chongyun again)
Media:vo cycop001 1902408 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: Have you procured all the ingredients for the popsicles?
(Opens the submission menu)
The Travelers makes popsicles with the ingredients gathered...
Media:vo cycop001 1902405 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: Is it finished? Oh... the color seems to be off...
Media:vo cycop001 1902405 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: Let me try one.
Media:vo cycop001 1902405 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: O—Okay... here it goes.
Media:vo cycop001 1902405 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: *licks popsicle* U—Ugh...
Media:vo cycop001 1902405 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: It's so spicy! ...My throat is on fire!
Media:vo cycop001 1902405 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: ...No, no — this is not good!

 Quest DescriptionAfter enjoying your meal, it's time to continue moving forward. But the destination isn't all that important — feeling carefree is the only thing that matters.
One Hearty Meal Later[]

(Upon arriving to lakeside)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916202 layla 01.ogg Layla: Wow, I never knew there was such a large lake here. It's so beautiful...
Media:vo lylcop001 1916202 layla 02.ogg Layla: The feeling of cool lake water can wash away all your troubles.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916202 layla 03.ogg Layla: Can you wait for a minute? I'd like to wash my face. I think it'd be refreshing.
 Why don't we just go for a swim?
Media:vo lylcop001 1916202 layla 04.ogg Layla: Huh? A swim?
Media:vo lylcop001 1916202 layla 05.ogg Layla: I can't remember the last time I went swimming. I might not even know how to anymore...
 That's impossible.
 It's one of those things that you never forget.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916202 layla 06.ogg Layla: Umm, okay... I'll try to swim over there.
 Let's see who can get there first.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916202 layla 07.ogg Layla: Wait, no, no, no. I'll definitely lose...
Media:vo lylcop001 1916202 layla 08.ogg Layla: No, forget about winning or losing, Layla! It'll be fun either way!
(Swim with Layla)
(After the cutscene ended)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916203 layla 01.ogg Layla: Wait, we're starting already!?
(Talk to Layla)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916204 layla 01.ogg Layla: *panting* As expected, I lost... How would I be able to beat an adventurer at something like this...?
 I think you're a great swimmer. You weren't too far behind.
 I was worried that you would drown.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916204 layla 02.ogg Layla: Really? Hehe... Among my childhood friends, I was considered one of the more athletic ones.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916204 layla 03.ogg Layla: But that's just like how I used to think that I had a gift for learning... After coming to Sumeru City, I realized that I only thought that because my hometown is such a small place.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916204 layla 04.ogg Layla: On top of that, I'm getting weaker and weaker because I'm barely able to sleep nowadays... There's no way I can bring myself to brag about anything now...
 You really are too modest.
(Stress Value −1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916204 layla 05.ogg Layla: Please, you're always encouraging me. I'm starting to feel embarrassed.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916204 layla 06.ogg Layla: But swimming again really feels great. Every muscle in my body was engaged. I probably wouldn't have to worry about my thesis if I turned into a fish, don't you think?
Media:vo lylcop001 1916204 layla 07.ogg Layla: I'm just kidding, of course. I'm sure fish have worries of their own. I'm quite content with how things are right now.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916204 layla 08.ogg Layla: Let's keep going, shall we?
(Continue to From Riverbeds to Mountain Peaks)

From Riverbeds to Mountain Peaks[]

(Go to the top of the mountain)
(Upon arriving to bouncy mushroom)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916205 layla 01.ogg Layla: There's a Mushroom here. You wanna jump on it to see what's up there?
Media:vo lylcop001 1916205 layla 02.ogg Layla: I haven't done this in a while... I kinda wanna give it a try.
(Upon arriving to the top of the mountain)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 01.ogg Layla: We've walked pretty far now.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 02.ogg Layla: But I barely felt the time passing by.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 03.ogg Layla: I've been staring at books and my thesis every day... I've forgotten how nice and happy life actually can be.
 That's why I said that your life shouldn't completely revolve around your studies.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 04.ogg Layla: You're right. No matter how much of a hard time I'm having in academics, I should still find the time to look after myself and fulfill my needs.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 05.ogg Layla: You really understand more about life than I do.
 Would you like to take the opportunity to release all your stress?
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 06.ogg Layla: Release my stress... Oh, I see what you mean. Being at the top of a mountain really does make someone want to yell out loud.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 07.ogg Layla: But, it's a little... uncivilized, isn't it?
 It's okay. We're already here, so we should make the best of it.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 08.ogg Layla: Alright, I'll give it a try. Just promise not to laugh, okay?
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 09.ogg Layla: *inhales*
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 10.ogg Layla: AAAAAAHHH!!!
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 11.ogg Layla: WHAT AN AMAZING DAAAAY!!!
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 12.ogg Layla: It feels like my entire body is bubbling with excitement after yelling like that.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 13.ogg Layla: This happiness was so common as a child, but before I knew it... this feeling was buried in the bottom of my heart.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 14.ogg Layla: It's getting late. Why don't we rest here for a while? I'll tell you some interesting astrology stuff when the stars come out.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 15.ogg Layla: Oh, but it's alright if you don't want to listen to that kind of stuff. We can also tell jokes about life... or talk about anything you're interested in.
 We can chat about whatever you'd like.
 Let's save the stuff about stars for when they appear.
(Stress Value −1)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 16.ogg Layla: Okay. Then... I'll tell you more about me.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 17.ogg Layla: The only reason I ever chose to study astrology is because of how beautiful the stars are at night, that's all.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 18.ogg Layla: My teacher told me that nature possesses a certain power that grants people an equal amount of kindness and fairness, regardless of the different talents they may possess.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 19.ogg Layla: And that's why I wanted to call the kind person who's always helping me as the "blessing from the stars."
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 20.ogg Layla: The stars in the sky are something that brings happiness to people.
 Yes, they truly are.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 21.ogg Layla: Everything about home is filled with purity and passion. My memories of that place are wonderful. I never want to forget them.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 22.ogg Layla: If I were to ever discard anything so pure, I don't think I'd ever be able to find a place to anchor myself in the vast sea of knowledge.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 23.ogg Layla: That's why, no matter how tiring or how hard it gets, I won't let my family down. They are already an important part of me.
 That's another reason not to lose yourself in the face of pressure.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 24.ogg Layla: Yeah. Thank goodness you were there to help me out, or I don't know where I would've ended up.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 25.ogg Layla: We probably still have a while until the stars come out...
Media:vo lylcop001 1916206 layla 26.ogg Layla: Only kids sit around like this, waiting for the stars to appear...

(Approach the location)

Media:vo zycop001 1901401 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Time to put our ninjutsu to good use!

(After the battle)
Media:vo zycop001 1901409 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: *sigh* How am I supposed to nap here with slimes everywhere?
 Is this where you usually come to nap?
Media:vo zycop001 1901409 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: *yawn* Yep. It's not ideal for hiding, but it certainly has a nice view and tons of fresh air. Napping here makes your dreams just that much sweeter.
Media:vo zycop001 1901409 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: But slimes? Seriously, what gives? There's never any slimes here...
Media:vo zycop001 1901409 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: And now there's ashes everywhere. Ugh, I can't nap here, I'll feel all nasty and grimy and it'll make my outfit dirty.
 You seem pretty picky over just a place to nap.
Media:vo zycop001 1901409 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: Of course! Even though I can sleep practically anywhere, it's very important to consider the quality of my sleep.
Media:vo zycop001 1901409 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Just in case the shrine maiden ever appears, I always sleep with one ear to the ground. That way, I can run to escape the moment I hear her approaching.
Media:vo zycop001 1901409 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: *yawn* Which is exactly why I'm such a light sleeper now.
 You're always alert, aren't you...
 I suppose one could say this makes you an even more impressive ninja.
Media:vo zycop001 1901409 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: That's how things are during the day. But sometimes, I can't sleep well at night, either. *sigh*
Media:vo zycop001 1901409 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: I suppose the good news is that we got rid of these slimes before the whole forest went up in flames.
Media:vo zycop001 1901409 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Seems like I'll need to scout out another place to nap.
 Do you have any backup napping spots?
Media:vo zycop001 1901409 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: Of course, but the shrine maiden is always looking for where I like to sleep, so I have to keep finding more.
Media:vo zycop001 1901409 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: Come with me, hopefully she hasn't discovered any of my recent napping spots.

The Enigmatic Shrine Maiden[]

(Approach the location)
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Hmm, seems like the coast is clear.
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Huh? Wait, what's that?
 It looks like some sort of sharp, pointy ninja gadget...
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Oh, now I recognize it. It's meant to keep intruders at bay, but is also often used for ninja training. It really hurts if you step on one, so be careful.
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: There's a bunch on the stones here, and probably some in the grass as well... I see traces of lots of activity here. I've got a bad feeling about this.
 What's wrong?
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: It's one of the shrine maiden's tactics. Once she discovers one of my napping spots, she'll turn it into a training area for the Shuumatsuban to keep me from sleeping there.
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Ugh, but how did she find this one...
 Do you think she's also the one behind the slimes we ran into earlier?
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: I dunno, maybe not... The shrine maiden should know the danger that Pyro Slimes present to the forest.
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: But it's hard to say for sure... The shrine maiden will go to extreme lengths to catch me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: It's almost as if she's my sworn enemy...
 She wouldn't go that far, would she?
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: She's the bane of my existence, that's for sure.
 Why don't we go and have a look at your next backup spot?
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: Hold on, we can't just leave all these scattered around like this.
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: Otherwise, it could harm the kitsune or other wildlife. We should pick 'em all up.
 Aren't you worried that Kano Nana could still be in the area?
 If we don't leave, there's a good chance that the shrine maiden will catch us.
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: Then we'll just have to be quick. Let's pick it all up and run. We can do it fast enough if we try.
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: How could the ninja leave their training equipment just sitting out here like this? Don't they know that it's dangerous?
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: The next time I'm at the Shuumatsuban, I'll be sure to give them a piece of my mind.
 You... give them a piece of your mind?
 Do you really dare?
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Y—Yeah, that's right. We can't just let something like this slide!
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Uh, I mean... I can't promise anything, but I'll try...
Media:vo zycop001 1901402 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: Anyway, let's get a move on. We need to pick all this stuff up.

(After retrieving the ninja equipment)
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Whew... Finally. That's the last of it.
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Hehe, see? Even the kitsune are thanking us now.
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: That's right, don't eat any strange ninja gadgets, got it?
 You really love the wildlife here, don't you, Sayu?
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: This is their home. We can't just let them get hurt here.
 You're a very caring person, Sayu.
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: Well, uh... I just wanted to help the wildlife here.
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: *yawn* But what should we do about getting a nap... *sigh* The shrine maiden could appear at any moment.
 Perhaps we can go to your next napping spot?
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: Given what we saw just now, I'm afraid the shrine maiden has already discovered all my usual spots. Nowhere is safe from the maiden...
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: In which case, we'll need to scout out a new place to nap.
 How about Konda Village?
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: No, there's too many people there. All the shrine maiden would have to do is ask around and she'd know where we are in no time.
 How about Amakane Island?
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: The scenery is nice there, but there's too much rustling and noise. It'll be hard to sleep there.
 How about Tenshukaku?
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: What made you think of Tenshukaku? You don't want to make me sleep in between the eaves, do you?
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: I could definitely sleep soundly in a place like that, but there won't be enough space for me to grow at all.
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: *sigh* I guess there's no choice but to go out adventuring... As they say, "The most dangerous of places is often the safest of places."
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: So if we're going to avoid the shrine maiden, I guess the safest place would be the Grand Narukami Shrine.
 Huh? Are you serious?
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: Yeah. She'd never expect to find me sleeping in the big tree at the Grand Narukami Shrine.
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: All we need to do is carefully make our way inside without drawing any unwanted attention.
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Once we're in, I'll be able to take a nice, long, undisturbed nap.
 I suppose that makes sense. Let's give it a try.
Media:vo zycop001 1901404 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: Alright, up the mountain we go!

For Sweeter Dreams[]

(Approach the Grand Narukami Shrine)
Media:vo zycop001 1901405 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Huh? Forget the shrine maiden, this place is crawling with members of the Yashiro Commission. What are they all doing here?
Media:vo zycop001 1901405 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: But we can't turn back now. Let's sneak inside and have a closer look.
Media:vo zycop001 1901405 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Don't alert them to our presence, alright? Quietly now...

(If you're discovered)
You and Sayu are discovered. The infiltration falls through.
(Return to the previous step)

(After reaching the destination)
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Whew, good thing they didn't notice us. That scary Guuji lady doesn't seem to be around either.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Actually, I've always wanted to come here for a nap. It's spacious, and... *yawn* super comfy.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: I'm already... really sleepy... *yawn*
 We went through a lot to get here.
 Then I won't disturb you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: Thanks for sticking with me. If you ever need a ninja, my skills are at your disposal.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: Even though I prefer to avoid my work with the Shuumatsuban, if it's you that I'm assisting, I'm more than happy to help.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Ideally when I'm not sleepy, of course.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: Sayu! Where are you, Sayu?
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: ...Wha!?
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: The shrine maiden! H—How did she find me here!?
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: Wh—What should I do... Oh, not good... not good!
 I'll go stall her to buy you some time.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Would you? Oh, thanks! Just see if you can lure her away from here!
You reach the foot of the tree, and Kano Nana has coincidentally just arrived in the area.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 kanonana 02.ogg Kano Nana: Hmm? Oh, it's you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 kanonana 03.ogg Kano Nana: After I returned from checking with the Yashiro Commission concerning the ambush operation, I discovered that you and Sayu had already left the forest.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 kanonana 04.ogg Kano Nana: Is she here with you?
 Nope, she's not here.
 She left a while ago.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 kanonana 05.ogg Kano Nana: Strange, I found all sorts of traces along the road. They all pointed me towards this shrine.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 kanonana 06.ogg Kano Nana: Well, never mind. If you haven't seen her here, then perhaps she ran off to another one of her hiding spots.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 kanonana 07.ogg Kano Nana: I did manage to confirm that the ambush order did not originate from the Yashiro Commission. An investigation is already underway. It seems we'll have more information soon enough, you needn't worry.
 Thank you, that was very kind of you. If that's all, I'll be leaving now.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 kanonana 08.ogg Kano Nana: Hmm... Wait a moment.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 kanonana 09.ogg Kano Nana: Are you absolutely sure you haven't seen Sayu?
 Yes, I'm sure.
 Y—Yes, absolutely sure.
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 kanonana 10.ogg Kano Nana: *sigh* ...
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 kanonana 11.ogg Kano Nana: Although I can't prove it, my intuition tells me that she is nearby.
 (She's really not buying it...)
 (No wonder Sayu's always looking over her shoulder...)
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 kanonana 12.ogg Kano Nana: Huh...
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 kanonana 13.ogg Kano Nana: Strange, I don't think I've ever seen this kitsune around the Shrine before...
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 kanonana 14.ogg Kano Nana: It seems to be concerned about the tree here... I wonder if there's something in the branches.
 (Oh no, it's the kitsune from when we were picking up all the ninja gear!)
 Run!!!
Media:vo zycop001 1901407 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: You'll never catch me!!!

Ending: Definitely No Work Today![]

Since hiding won't work, Sayu now resorts to her final trump card: speed!

An Ordinary Day for the Knights of Favonius[]

(Talk to the voice behind the door of Klee's confinement room, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909504 klee 01.ogg Voice Behind the Door: When is Kaeya coming back? He still hasn't read me the 10th and 11th stories from The Fox in the Dandelion Sea...
(Talk to Jean)
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Hey, you two busy?
 Long time no see, everyone.
 I'm back, Mondstadt.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 lisa 01.ogg Lisa: You must have had a tough journey, Kaeya. Oh, it's been a while, cutie.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 qin 01.ogg Jean: Yes, welcome back, Kaeya. Why is the Honorary Knight accompanying you?
You explain your chance encounter with Kaeya in Sumeru to Jean and Lisa.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 qin 02.ogg Jean: Hmm, I understand. Back to matters at hand, Kaeya, I have already received your report. You did well this time, thank you.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 qin 03.ogg Jean: A few days ago, we received a letter from the representative of the wine merchants' association in Sumeru. It was thanks to your on-the-spot decisions that further losses due to continued delays were avoided.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Just doing my duty — anything to reduce the Acting Grand Master's workload. Oh, I nearly forgot. I have some unused travel funds. I'll return the surplus now.
 (He's talking like he wasn't planning on spending it.)
 (I have a sudden urge to expose him...)
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 qin 04.ogg Jean: Given the suddenness of the situation, and the difficulty in resolving it, I authorized a greater than normal disbursement in case of unforeseen circumstances.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 qin 05.ogg Jean: But I didn't think there would be this much left over. Thank you, Kaeya.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Just doing the right thing. But I'm not actually here for a post-trip debrief. I brought some souvenirs back for everyone.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 lisa 02.ogg Lisa: Souvenirs from Sumeru?

Media:vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Here... The letter opener is for Jean, the jeweled brooch is for Lisa, and the items in the box are for everyone else.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 qin 06.ogg Jean: This artistry of this is exquisite, look at the ornamentation on the sheath... This must be one of those crafts unique to Sumeru. It's my first time seeing one in person. Thank you, Kaeya.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 lisa 03.ogg Lisa: I love the color of the gem in this brooch, and the setting is so elegant. You have excellent taste, Kaeya. This can't have come cheap?
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: It wasn't too bad. I didn't spend too much...
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 01.ogg ???: Might I intrude a moment?
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 qin 07.ogg Jean: Albedo, is that you? Come in.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: I've finished the latest quarterly expenses report for the workshop. It's ready for your review. (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), greetings. And Kaeya, welcome back from Sumeru. Haven't seen you in a while.
 Hello, Albedo.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: You two look like you're in good spirits.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: As a matter of fact, the Honorary Knight and I traveled back from Sumeru together. Ah yes, and I brought some souvenirs for you and Klee, they form a set... Hold on, let me dig them out...
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: You're too kind. Klee has been constantly inquiring as to the timing of your return lately.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 qin 08.ogg Jean: Since you weren't around, she thought you had also been grounded, and that it would be a long time before you could come out.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 lisa 04.ogg Lisa: Children always have the most peculiar way of looking at things, hehe.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: ..."Also" been grounded? Sounds like things haven't been too dull for you all in my absence.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 qin 09.ogg Jean: It's Klee's third time this month.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: Evidently, you're not the least bit surprised.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: No... On the contrary, what would be a surprise is if Klee ever managed to stay out of trouble for a substantial length of time.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: Heh. Anyway, since my souvenir is part of a set with Klee's, there's no rush to give it to me.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: When Klee's next... well, released, I'll bring her to see you sometime. We'll collect our souvenirs together.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Sure, makes sense. Leave the surprise for the person who'll enjoy it the most.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: I'll leave these documents here. I'll take my leave now, everyone.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 qin 10.ogg Jean: Kaeya, I've approved your vacation request, use this time to relax and unwind. Don't worry about the report and other work, I'll take care of it.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 qin 11.ogg Jean: You too, Honorary Knight. There isn't any work the Knights of Favonius require your assistance with at this time, so please take it easy.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: Thank you, then we'll be going now.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 lisa 05.ogg Lisa: Enjoy your vacation. But don't forget to return The Fox in the Dandelion Sea series before it's due.
Media:vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Don't worry, I'm nearly done with those. I'll be able to return them in a few days.
(Talk to Jean, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909504 qin 01.ogg Jean: Though there's always something to do, with everyone lending a hand, I always feel at ease.
(Talk to Lisa, optional)
Media:vo kycop001 1909504 lisa 01.ogg Lisa: Kaeya is just as thoughtful as always.
Homecoming[]
(Outside the headquarters)
Media:vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: I'm surprised Klee still hasn't escaped... I taught her a few tricks just before I left.
 Why are you smirking?
 This is just the norm to you?
Media:vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Kids will always have their moments of mischief, but to be able to grow up without a worry or care in the world is something truly precious.
Media:vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: ...
Media:vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Well, now that all the gifts for the Knights of Favonius are with Jean, next up is...
Media:vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Oh... how about we visit the Dawn Winery under the pretext of delivering souvenirs and try to score some free wine? It's been a long time since I last saw everyone there. Plus it'll be the perfect time to treat you to some of their newest brews.
Media:vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Diluc should be there tomorrow, since he has business to deal with. But then there's nothing scheduled for the day after tomorrow, so perhaps it'll be easier to get free wine then...
Media:vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: What do you think? When should we go?
 Tomorrow. (This dialogue option leads to Fragrance of Wine.)
Media:vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: That works, then I guess we'll see Diluc. Let's meet at the front entrance of the Dawn Winery tomorrow.
 The day after tomorrow. (This dialogue option leads to Taste of Home.)
Media:vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Great, then it's settled. Let's meet the day after tomorrow at the front entrance of the Dawn Winery.

Media:vo noecop002 1908401 irontonguetian 02.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Looking at your outfit, you don't seem to be an ordinary civilian. In which case, surely...
 Here it comes.
 Here we go again.
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 irontonguetian 03.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: ...You must be an illustrious knight of Favonius!
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 irontonguetian 04.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Pardon my directness. My name is Iron Tongue Tian, and I was hoping that you could help me out...
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Hold on, I'm really sorry...
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: ...I am not yet an official knight, but just a maid of the Knights of Favonius...
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 irontonguetian 05.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Uhh... Maid? Of the Knights? ...A Maid-Knight!
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 irontonguetian 06.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Now that is genuinely intriguing! Miss, if you're willing to help me out, I have every confidence that you will provide me with infinitely more source material than any other knight could!
 ...Source material?
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 irontonguetian 07.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: As you can see, I have been a local storyteller here for a long time, and, well, my audience is starting to tire of hearing the same old stories over and over again...
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 irontonguetian 08.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: When I saw this young lady show up just now, I was quite awestruck by her! So much so that I was suddenly inspired by the idea of writing a new book: "A Knight's Journey Through Liyue!"
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 irontonguetian 09.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: However... inspiration is just the start, I still need some material to work with. Even the most ingenious storytellers don't just come up with stories out of thin air.
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 irontonguetian 10.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: I do occasionally hear anecdotes about the Knights of Favonius doing the rounds here in Liyue, but they're mostly unreliable rumors, with everyone telling a different story. Far better to find an actual knight and see for myself!
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: But I... I am still not a knight yet...
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 irontonguetian 11.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Ah, don't worry about all that. As the saying goes, the story should by "inspired by life but larger than life." As the storyteller, I can change a detail or two here and add some dramatic effect there... y'know?
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Honorary Knight... I am a little conflicted. What should I do...?
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Although I should always lend a hand to anyone in need... It would be dishonest for me to pretend to be a real knight.
 It's not dishonest, you're just helping generate some ideas.
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 irontonguetian 12.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Haha! You understand me! Miss, rest assured that I will not put you in a difficult spot.
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 irontonguetian 13.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: All I'm asking you to do is come with me to the countryside and show me some of your bladework. Let me see something new! I'll fill in all the other details... All within reason, of course.
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Well... Okay then, if it's just providing initial source material...
(Head to the hilichurl camp in the city's outskirts)
Media:vo noecop002 1908401 irontonguetian 14.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: I heard earlier from the Millelith that some hilichurls have been wreaking havoc in the countryside. Ooh! Let's head over there...
Media:vo noecop002 1908405 irontonguetian 01.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: This looks to be the place. Argh... But it seems our timing is off — the hilichurls are nowhere to be seen...
Media:vo noecop002 1908405 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Oh... If the hilichurls are not around, does that mean you can't get any source material?
Media:vo noecop002 1908405 irontonguetian 02.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Not necessarily. Look at all the things they left here... Miss, why don't you use your greatsword to clean the place up?
Media:vo noecop002 1908405 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Cleaning up? Well, that shouldn't be too difficult...
Media:vo noecop002 1908405 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: But the hilichurls could return at any moment. Mr. Tian, please find a safe location from which to observe.
Media:vo noecop002 1908405 irontonguetian 03.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Okay! "...The knight's meticulous mind attended to each and every detail of her duty with the utmost care and attention..." Ahaha, this is good, I can work with this. Very knightly...
Media:vo noecop002 1908405 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Y—You're taking notes already!?
(Cleaning up the hilichurl camp)
Media:vo noecop002 1908405 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Cleaning up a camp... I guess I do this kind of thing all the time...
Media:vo noecop002 1908405 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: ...So it should be okay to include in your book...
(Breaking an object)
Media:vo noecop002 1908405 irontonguetian 04.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Wonderful! I'll call this one... the "Indomitable Sword of Favonius"!
(Breaking the last object at the hilichurl camp)
Media:vo noecop002 1908405 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Oh no, the hilichurls are back! Mr. Tian, please, be careful!
(After defeating opponents)
Media:vo noecop002 1908402 irontonguetian 01.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Sensational! I will call that one the "Impregnable Shield of Chivalry!"
Media:vo noecop002 1908402 irontonguetian 02.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Mm, yes... It's coming to now... "With the prescience of a prophet, the knight foresaw the precise moment of the hilichurls' return and promptly warned the commoners to take cover. Now, she stood alone as she drew her sword and strode forward to confront the enemy..."
Media:vo noecop002 1908402 irontonguetian 03.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: This is all great material... It's just a pity that the only enemies are these hilichurls. Mm... It needs a little more oomph...!
Media:vo noecop002 1908402 irontonguetian 04.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: I've got it! Would the two of you be able to give me some kind of mementos?
Media:vo noecop002 1908402 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: ...Mementos?
Media:vo noecop002 1908402 irontonguetian 05.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: That's right, mementos! Though the story is a work of fiction, the more real it feels, the more engaging it will be...
Media:vo noecop002 1908402 irontonguetian 06.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Some sort of battle trophy to display before the audience — ooh — would really seal the deal...
Media:vo noecop002 1908402 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Okay, um... So something like a hilichurl mask or an arrowhead...?
Media:vo noecop002 1908402 irontonguetian 07.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: If it's all the same to you, uh... I was thinking more along the lines of... Maybe... a component from that Ruin Guard?
 Is this what you meant by "larger than life"?
 Is this what you meant by "dramatic effect"?
Media:vo noecop002 1908402 irontonguetian 08.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Yes, you've got it! You really understand where I'm coming from. I've heard that there's a very common component in Ruin Guards called the, uh... Chaos Device?
Media:vo noecop002 1908402 irontonguetian 09.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: I—I should write down my new ideas before I forget them... Um, just hand the Chaos Device to me once you've managed to obtain it.
(Talk to Iron Tongue Tian again)
Media:vo noecop002 1908402 irontonguetian 10.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: If you could hand me that Chaos Device once you've managed to procure it, I'd be much obliged.
(Give a Chaos Device to Iron Tongue Tian)
Media:vo noecop002 1908403 irontonguetian 01.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Oh! Such mighty power, so battered and bruised... Mm, haha... I just need to embellish it a little further and this will be perfect!
Media:vo noecop002 1908403 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Embellish it... even further?
Media:vo noecop002 1908403 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Hmm... Well, as long as I have been able to help you with your creative process...
Media:vo noecop002 1908403 irontonguetian 02.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Of course you have! Okay, I know where I'm going with this story now... I need to get back and start writing...
Media:vo noecop002 1908403 irontonguetian 03.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Oh, and if the two of you have any free time later, stop by Third-Round Knockout and you can hear me tell my new story!
Media:vo noecop002 1908403 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: I wonder how Mr. Tian's story will turn out in the end. For some reason... I have a bad feeling about it...
Media:vo noecop002 1908403 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), why don't we go back to Liyue Harbor and listen for ourselves?
(Return to Third-Round Knockout and listen to the story)
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 irontonguetian 01.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: ...With a roar like thunder, iron clashed with iron. Then, four gigantic fists came pounding into the ground with a force beyond what could be put into words... So colossal was their weight, and so earth-shattering their impact.
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 irontonguetian 02.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Such unthinkable power could easily cleave a stone peak right off the top of a mountain. Any ordinary human would either be torn to pieces in an instant, or at the very least suffer indescribable injuries...
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 irontonguetian 03.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: ...But not so the knight from beyond the border. She did not flinch in the face of the flying iron fists, but sank instead into a low fighting stance... and with one swift sweep of her sword, the clash of metal erupted once more, as dust billowed all around...
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 irontonguetian 04.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Moments later, there was a deep and dull thud as the dust dispersed to reveal... two pairs of iron claws, lying lifeless on the ground. Such is the awesome power of the "Impregnable Shield of Chivalry," an esoteric martial technique practiced exclusively by the Knights of Mondstadt...
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 irontonguetian 05.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: The knight barely had time to catch her breath before a dark shadow leaped up before her into the sky, blotting out the sun and turning day into night... It was... a Ruin Hunter!
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 irontonguetian 06.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: But she was no ordinary knight, and in her heart, she declared: "I have nothing to fear!" With an almighty battle cry, she unleashed the Indomitable Sword of Favonius... Beams of golden light shone out in all directions, a gust of wind raced through the battlefield, sparks flew, and debris fell...
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 qian 01.ogg Qian: One knight against two Ruin Guards... and a Ruin Hunter? Surely, that must be an exaggeration...
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 guanhai 01.ogg Guanhai: Eh, I suppose these stories are supposed to be taken with a grain of salt...
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Is this... about me? What is he talking about...?
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 noelle 02.ogg Noelle:  No, this won't do! I must ask him to rewrite the story!
 It's fine. The audience isn't taking it seriously...
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 irontonguetian 07.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: Hehe... Hard to believe? Then feast your eyes on this!
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 irontonguetian 08.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: This is solid proof of the Maid-Knight's journey to Liyue! A fragment of a Ruin Guard's armor, cut from its carcass by a blow of her blade in the midst of her death-defying battle!
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 qian 02.ogg Qian: ...That is a part of a Ruin Guard! A friend of a friend of a relative in the Millelith told me about these! Whoa...
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 guanhai 02.ogg Guanhai: ...It's real, alright! Look at the cuts on it... Fresh from the battlefield!
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: I... I must explain to Mr. Tian...
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Honesty... modesty... These are the virtues cherished by the Knights...
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 qian 03.ogg Qian: Hey, will you look at that — that girl over there looks uncannily similar to the knight from the story...
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 guanhai 03.ogg Guanhai: Oh, I'd say more than just similar... She's the spitting image! Oh, should we get an autograph? It's definitely her, the legendary Maid-Knight!
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Uh... Huh?
 Noelle, let's get out of here!
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Oh! Okay!
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 irontonguetian 09.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: ...And so, the knight went west from Stone Gate with her sword in hand, and scaled the mountains of a vast new land...
Media:vo noecop002 1908404 irontonguetian 10.ogg Iron Tongue Tian: A legend from the moment she set foot in Liyue, tales of the adventures of the Maid-Knight would be talked about for hundreds of generations... Stay tuned for the next chapter.

The Remaining Problem[]

(Upon arriving to House of Daena)
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 01.ogg Layla: Okay, I should get started on those notes. If there's anything you're curious about, you may go ahead and ask now. I can answer you as I write! I'm used to multi-tasking.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 02.ogg Layla: Oh, and I have to ask a favor. When you give the notes to her later, please don't tell her about my existence.
 Why's that?
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 03.ogg Layla: Hmm, well, she's always been in a fragile state. If she knew that there was another "Layla" who's always taking care of everything...
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 04.ogg Layla: She might feel like everything she's ever worked for is pointless, and that could lead to some demoralizing thoughts.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 05.ogg Layla: She's a resilient girl, but no matter how resilient she may be, no one can hold up to criticism and torment from themselves.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 06.ogg Layla: If her condition grows any worse, it's possible that I might cease to exist as well. Then there wouldn't be anyone to help her.
 But she's not doing very well now, either.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 07.ogg Layla: She's getting better, though, isn't she? It's apparent how hard she's working now.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 08.ogg Layla: She's my source of knowledge. I'm merely the representation of how she would be if she were rested and healthy.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 09.ogg Layla: I believe that she's one of the best, even in a place like the Akademiya, where geniuses come by the handful.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 10.ogg Layla: But growth is a process and shouldn't be rushed. I will always believe in and support her.
 It's good that she has you, or she might've already hit rock bottom.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 11.ogg Layla: Hahaha, believe me, even if she were to end up at rock bottom, she'd find a way to somehow laugh it off as one of her silly mistakes and climb her way out.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 12.ogg Layla: That's the kind of person she is.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 13.ogg Layla: Alright, I've written down all the possible questions that I think the advisers might ask. Next, I'll put together a few words of encouragement for her.
Media:vo lylcop001 1916002 layla 14.ogg Layla: I'm not going to sign it, obviously. Oh, and don't forget about our agreement.

Dialogue[]
 Quest DescriptionThe young thaumaturge Chongyun has obtained a great amount of (rather unreliable-sounding) information concerning evil spirits. He seems a little dejected when you point this out. As he uses a popsicle to suppress his pure-yang spirit, you both feel someone's gaze on you from the side.
A Curious Gaze[]

(Talk to Dalong)
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 long 01.ogg Dalong: O—Oh, huh?
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 long 02.ogg Dalong: Sorry, I'll leave now.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: No, please relax, there's no need to worry. We're not here for trouble. We couldn't help but notice you standing here for a while and thought that you might have something on your mind.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 long 03.ogg Dalong: No, there's nothing on my mind, I just thought... the thing you were eating looked tasty.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 long 04.ogg Dalong: My sister just loves food. She's always super happy whenever we get some tasty snacks.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 long 05.ogg Dalong: I'm her big brother and I should take care of her, but... Mom says we are too poor and she never lets me buy any snacks.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: Oh, you mean one of my popsicles? I'm afraid you wouldn't find them very tasty, though.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 long 06.ogg Dalong: It doesn't matter. My sister's never had anything like that before. I know she'd be happy to try one. Hmm, come to think of it, I've never had one either...
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: I see. Hmm... That might be difficult.
 What's wrong?
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: Well, I only have two popsicles left.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: These popsicles are very important to me, and I might need them if we encounter an evil spirit. Without them, I might not be able to control my constitution.
 What if you just give him one of the popsicles? (This dialogue option leads to The Exorcist's Path.)
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: Just give him one? Hmm, I suppose keeping the other for myself will be enough.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: You see, my young friend, these popsicles are very important to me. I'm afraid I can only give you one.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 long 07.ogg Dalong: That's okay, I don't need one, just as long as my sister is happy! Thanks a lot!
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 long 08.ogg Dalong: Woah, it's already starting to melt. E—Excuse me, I'd better hurry back to Chihu Rock now!
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: I never expected that something I use to suppress my yang energy would be so appealing to kids.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: Anyway, back to our hunt for evil spirits.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: Earlier, it seemed like you could easily discern which clues were most credible. You must truly be a knowledgeable and seasoned adventurer.
 I was just using good ol' common sense...
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 11.ogg Chongyun: I still have numerous clues from my friend which I haven't sorted through yet. With my limited experience, it's hard to tell whether they're reliable leads.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 12.ogg Chongyun: If you'd be willing, could you please come and take a look with me?
 Sure thing.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 13.ogg Chongyun: Alright, let's go to Wanwen Bookhouse. Please, follow me.
(Continues to The Exorcist's Path)
 Since he has a sister, you should probably give him both. (This dialogue option leads to Popsicles and Their Curious Uses.)
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 14.ogg Chongyun: Hmm, you're right. I'll just have to make do without my popsicles then.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 15.ogg Chongyun: Here, my young friend, you can have my last two popsicles. You and your sister can each have one.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 long 09.ogg Dalong: Really!? Wow! Th—Thanks a lot!
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 long 10.ogg Dalong: Hehe, just wait until my sister tries this. I haven't seen her smile in a long time!
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 long 11.ogg Dalong: Woah, it's already starting to melt. E—Excuse me, I'd better hurry back to Chihu Rock now!
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 16.ogg Chongyun: I never expected that something I use to suppress my yang energy would be so appealing to kids.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 17.ogg Chongyun: *sigh* But I wonder how I'll manage without any popsicles...
 Can't you buy some more?
 Are they difficult to make?
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 18.ogg Chongyun: I usually get my popsicles from Wanmin Restaurant on special order. The ingredients are not complicated, but the restaurant is always bustling with business and Chef Mao is usually too busy to take my order.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 19.ogg Chongyun: Now that I've used all my supply, I'll have to trouble him to make more.
 I'll go with you.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 20.ogg Chongyun: Oh, no need! I'm sure I can manage it on my own.
 I'm a little worried about you.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 21.ogg Chongyun: Oh, perhaps you were concerned about my unwell appearance earlier.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 22.ogg Chongyun: I appreciate your concern, but please don't worry about me. I assure you, I'm not that fragile.
 I'm concerned about your abundance of yang energy.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 23.ogg Chongyun: It's nothing to worry about. Over the years, I've grown quite accustomed to the discipline required to rein in my condition.
 I was the one who convinced you to give away all your popsicles in the first place.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 24.ogg Chongyun: No, please don't feel at fault. I think you made the right choice.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 25.ogg Chongyun: But if you're offering to come along, then I won't refuse.
Media:vo cycop001 1902201 chongyun 26.ogg Chongyun: Alright, please follow me to Wanmin Restaurant.

Sudden Shouting[]

(Before talking to Albert)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon remembers him! Isn't that Albert?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What is he doing here?
(Talk to Albert)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 01.ogg Albert: Barbara-sama... Are you here?
 What are you shouting about?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 02.ogg Albert: Uh — who, me? Ah, well... I'm looking for Barbara-sama.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 03.ogg Albert: I was originally planning to give her some herbs at the Cathedral, but Sister Victoria told me she had gone out to attend to some matters.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 04.ogg Albert: When I sought Barbara-sama for healing recently, she mentioned to me that the Church was running low on certain medicine ingredients...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 05.ogg Albert: I seem to remember the ingredient she mentioned... some type of red Wolfhook berry.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 06.ogg Albert: I figured she was most likely somewhere out here picking Wolfhooks, so I thought I'd come and lend her a hand.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 07.ogg Albert: Besides, as leader of the Barbara Fan Club, how could I ever let Barbara-sama go wandering alone in such a dangerous place?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 08.ogg Albert: So I decided to come to Wolvendom, looking for Barbara-sama and picking red Wolfhook along the way.
 Oh, so you picked all the berries...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 09.ogg Albert: That's right, and I'll take them back to the Church shortly. After all, I am the leader of the Barbara Fan Club. It's my duty to make sure Barbara-sama's life's easier.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 10.ogg Albert: Huh? But... judging from your expression, you've never heard of the Barbara Fan Club?
 Hold on, what's the Barbara Fan Club?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 11.ogg Albert: Oh, you can't be serious! It's only the biggest club for Barbara-sama fans in all of Mondstadt.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 12.ogg Albert: Hehe, even Huffman's a member now!
 Even Huffman?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 13.ogg Albert: Of course! Barbara-sama has a lot of fans in Mondstadt that wish to support her, you know.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 14.ogg Albert: Uh... Anyways, the Barbara Fan Club will have to wait for the moment, I'll fill you in on how great it is when I have time later. I must keep searching for Barbara-sama for now.
(The branch that the dialogue takes from this point is based on a hidden scoring system. The initial score is 0.)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 15.ogg Albert: *sigh* I don't really even know if Barbara-sama is anywhere around here.
 It is dangerous here, there are lots of monsters roaming about.
(±0 Points)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 16.ogg Albert: Yes, I'm well aware. That's exactly why as leader of the Barbara Fan Club, I could never let Barbara-sama wander here alone.
 Barbara isn't here anymore, you'd better head back to the city.
(+1 Point)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 17.ogg Albert: Huh? Wait a second, what do you mean, "anymore"? Did you see her here earlier?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 18.ogg Albert: So Barbara-sama is somewhere close by!
 Wolvendom is a large area, it would be difficult for you to cover it alone. You should find some others to help you search first.
(−1 Point)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 19.ogg Albert: *sigh* You might be right... I should go back and gather more people to help with the search.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 20.ogg Albert: Since Barbara-sama came here to pick those red Wolfhook, we could just follow the trail of those specific berries to lead us right to her.
 I think you've already searched most of the areas where red Wolfhooks grow.
(−1 Point)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 21.ogg Albert: Um, maybe... But this is the only place they could be... She wouldn't go anywhere else if those were what she was looking for.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 22.ogg Albert: Could she really have returned to Mondstadt?
 There might be some other areas where Wolfhooks grow that you haven't heard about, perhaps Barbara went somewhere else?
(+1 Point)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 23.ogg Albert: Ah, you're right. I should probably try searching some other areas.
 How can you be certain that she's out picking Wolfhooks? She might not even be anywhere nearby here.
(±0 Points)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 24.ogg Albert: I heard it from Sister Victoria herself. She told me that she overheard another sister saying that Barbara-sama had come to Wolvendom to pick Wolfhook berries.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 25.ogg Albert: In fact... I could have sworn I heard Barbara-sama's voice when I came here...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 26.ogg Albert: By the way... You didn't happen to see any sign of Barbara-sama when you arrived, did you? Perhaps I was hearing things...
 There are all sorts of monsters in Wolvendom, and not to mention wolves... That must be what you heard.
(+1 Point)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 27.ogg Albert: No way! How could I ever mistake the sound of some monsters for Barbara-sama's sweet voice!?
 I've been here clearing the area of monsters all day, but I didn't hear anything.
(±0 Points)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 28.ogg Albert: Well, of course you didn't hear anything... You were focused on defeating monsters the whole time.
 But do you still hear her now? Barbara-sama may have already left the area a while ago.
(−1 Point)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 29.ogg Albert: Ugh, you might be right... I haven't heard any sign of her since.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 30.ogg Albert: Unless she's intentionally trying to avoid me... But she'd never have any reason to do that.
 Of course not.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 31.ogg Albert: Right. Hmm, well, it seems that Barbara-sama may have already left the area...
(If overall score is equal to or greater than 0, go to Branch 1)
(If overall score is negative, go to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 32.ogg Albert: Well, whatever. I don't have time to keep talking like this. I should keep searching for Barbara-sama...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 33.ogg Albert: ...And you should go back to whatever it is you were doing.

Albert Never Gives Up[]

(While following Albert)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 albert 01.ogg Albert: Barbara-sama! Where are you?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: He's bound to find Barbara here sooner or later if this keeps up...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Unless... we could start yelling too. That way, Barbara will hear us coming and will still have a chance to escape.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hey! What are you so embarrassed about? Ugh... just follow Paimon's lead!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Barbara — ohh Barbara! It's us!!!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Barbara!? WHERE ARE YOU BARBARA!!!???
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 albert 02.ogg Albert: Huh? You're yelling even louder than me!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hehe... That's just because we like Barbara too, right?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 albert 03.ogg Albert: Oh, I see. In that case, let's do our best together!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: BARBARA — IT'S US!!! ARE YOU THERE!!!???
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 albert 04.ogg Albert: Barbara-sama... Where are you?
(Talk to Albert)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900202 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whew, it seems Barbara's already left. *sigh* Good...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900202 albert 01.ogg Albert: *cough* My throat is getting... *cough*
Media:vo bblcop001 1900202 albert 02.ogg Albert: Oh, I guess Barbara-sama isn't here after all...
 Surely you're not going to give up so easily?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900202 albert 03.ogg Albert: *cough* No, it's not that... I just... *cough*
 I'll help you keep calling for her.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900202 albert 04.ogg Albert: Al— *cough* ...Alright. My throat won't hold up much longer...
 BARBARA — WHERE ARE YOU!!!???
 BARBARA — ARE YOU THERE!!!???
Media:vo bblcop001 1900202 albert 05.ogg Albert: Heh... It's no wonder you've become the Honorary Knight, you certainly give it your all — *cough*
 See, Barbara's nowhere to be found here. Let's head back.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900202 albert 06.ogg Albert: Ugh... Oh, alright. It seems Barbara-sama isn't anywhere around here. Let's return to the city.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900202 albert 07.ogg Albert: *cough* Once Barbara-sama returns to Mondstadt, though... I'll have to ask her to heal my throat... *cough*

Branch 2[]

Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 34.ogg Albert: *sigh* Alright then, Barbara-sama must be somewhere else...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 35.ogg Albert: *sigh* But I still feel a bit worried. I'll go report the matter to Huffman and then have another look around the church.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 36.ogg Albert: Here, you can have these red Wolfhooks I picked earlier. There's no way I'd be able to carry them all back to the city. I'll take what I can to the church after I get back.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900201 albert 37.ogg Albert: Ugh, I just hope that Barbara-sama did indeed go back to the city...

Albert Is Amenable to Reason[]

(Report back to Barbara)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: So... is he gone now?
 Yeah, he's gone for now.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Whew, thank you! Although... I guess I'm not being very polite towards him...
 Why are you trying to avoid being seen?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Well... it's a little embarrassing to say, but...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: In Mondstadt, I often perform songs for people. Because it's been so well received, the other sisters have started encouraging me to perform across Teyvat. Now, more and more people are showing up to hear me perform.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: I'm happy to see such turnouts, don't get me wrong... but... Now, people always stop me on the street when I go shopping, or when I go out for personal matters...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: I know that all they want is to get my autograph, or to ask me how I'm doing, which isn't a bad thing.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: And... I'm very thankful for all my fans, but... there are simply too many of them.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: I always do my best to fulfill their requests and not let them down.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: But... sometimes... I feel that I just don't have the strength to do so.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: Even when I'm in the church, people will still come hoping to greet me. I'm constantly in a state of tension, no matter where I go.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: The reason I came here was not only to find Wolfhooks for making Tunner's cough medicine, but also to have some quiet time alone...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: Do you understand that feeling? To sit peacefully and not think about anything... just by yourself. It's simply the feeling of relaxation.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 13.ogg Barbara: It's been far too long since I've had that feeling. Before I knew it, I was out here all day and forgot to return to the city.
 If you're looking for Wolfhooks, there should be plenty nearby.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 14.ogg Barbara: No, I couldn't find any... The kind I'm looking for are red.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 15.ogg Barbara: I remember seeing them here before, but I've already searched the area and there aren't any. I wonder if someone had already picked them? No, people seldom come out here...
 Are these the kind of Wolfhook you're looking for?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 16.ogg Barbara: Huh? Yes, those are the ones! And you've found so many, these will be more than enough! But where did you...
The Traveler tells Barbara what happened with Albert...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 17.ogg Barbara: Oh my... Oh, I've been far too impolite.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 18.ogg Barbara: Albert came all this way just to help me, and I...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 19.ogg Barbara: But if I were to go and apologize to him, it would probably only make him feel even worse.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 20.ogg Barbara: *sigh* I guess I'm still just too immature...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 21.ogg Barbara: Let's just head back to the city for now. I'll think of a way to make it up to Albert later.
 But no one even knows about this matter...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 22.ogg Barbara: Well, I know, and you also know. And we mustn't forget that Barbatos also knows. We certainly can't say that "no one knows about this matter," don't you think?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 23.ogg Barbara: Besides, as a deaconess, I could never simply ignore such a matter. I must take the appropriate actions and make things right.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900203 barbara 24.ogg Barbara: I'll see to that matter on my own. Anyway, the berries you have here will be just enough. We should get going.

Lingering Worry[]

(Approach Yuyan, Dalong, and Little Le)
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 yuyan 01.ogg Yuyan: Where did you get these? I didn't give you any Mora.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 yuyan 02.ogg Yuyan: You didn't steal them, did you!?
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 long 01.ogg Dalong: No, I didn't steal 'em! I talked to a nice person and they just gave 'em to me.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 yuyan 03.ogg Yuyan: So, you've been asking for food on the street! I've already told you, such behavior makes you look uneducated!
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 yuyan 04.ogg Yuyan: How could you ask a stranger for food? Is that any different from being a beggar?
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 long 02.ogg Dalong: B—But, I didn't ask them for it... They asked me if I wanted some!
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 yuyan 05.ogg Yuyan: That's it, no more lies! Just be honest about your mistake!
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: Uh, excuse me. He got those popsicles from me. He never asked us, we just gave them to him.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 long 03.ogg Dalong: Yeah, this is the nice person I was telling you about!
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 yuyan 06.ogg Yuyan: Wh—Who are you?
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: My name is Chongyun. As you could probably tell from my attire, I'm an exorcist. Your son really seemed interested in popsicles, so we thought we'd make a batch for you. That's why we're paying you a visit.
 There's no need to worry.
 We're not bad guys.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 yuyan 07.ogg Yuyan: O—Oh, I see. Sorry, I seem to have misunderstood him.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 yuyan 08.ogg Yuyan: I'm sorry, Dalong. It was wrong for Mommy to blame you.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 long 04.ogg Dalong: It's okay, Mommy. So am I allowed to talk to the nice popsicle man now?
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 yuyan 09.ogg Yuyan: Sure, but please keep an eye on your sister. Mommy will be back after some errands, okay?
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 long 05.ogg Dalong: Don't worry, I'll look after her. Bye, Mommy!
(Yuyan leaves)
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 long 06.ogg Dalong: Thanks, if it wasn't for you, I would have been in big trouble again.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 01.ogg Little Le: Thank you for the popsicle. It was so cool and delicious.
 Actually, we've made some more.
 I bet you're still hungry.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 long 07.ogg Dalong: Oh, wow, look at all the popsicles! Thanks!
 Don't eat them all in one go, you'll get brain freeze!
 Eating too many will upset your stomach.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 02.ogg Little Le: Okay, I've got it. Thanks, you guys! Y—You're like heroes!
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: Heroes?
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 long 08.ogg Dalong: Yeah, I've been telling a story to my sister recently, and she admires the story's heroes very much. They're chivalrous, just, and they help the weak fight against evil.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 03.ogg Little Le: And the heroes always have a good partner. One hero can beat up two bad guys, but with a good partner, they can defeat even more!
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 04.ogg Little Le: You two must be very good partners.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: Uh, w—well...
 That's right, we're great partners.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 05.ogg Little Le: Yay, I knew it! You two must get along well together.
 Actually, we just met...
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 06.ogg Little Le: Really? It sure doesn't seem that way. I bet you two will have a bright future together!
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 07.ogg Little Le: Um... we're gonna go play right now... Oh! Would you come and play with us?
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 long 09a.ogg Dalong: Don't be so childish! I'm sure heroes like them have important things to do.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 08.ogg Little Le: Huh? You mean you can't play?
 It wouldn't hurt to play a little, right?
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: Huh? W—Well, I...
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: Sorry, could I have a word with you, Traveler?
(To the side)
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: They look so excited to play with us, but I'm sure they'll be disappointed if we refuse.
 I have time.
 Let's go play with them for a while.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: ...Sure, that's fine, but...
 Something on your mind?
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: No, it's nothing, I'm just... a little bit worried.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: I spend most of my time purging evil spirits and practicing thaumaturgy.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 11.ogg Chongyun: And besides my training, I also need to constantly focus deeply on my own emotions to avoid losing control.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 12.ogg Chongyun: So, what I mean is that I seldom have time for anything that others would consider "fun." I don't even know the first thing about playing with kids...
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 13.ogg Chongyun: They think we're heroes, so they must be very excited to play with us. But, I'm afraid that they'll just find me... boring.
 It's simple, just be confident.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 14.ogg Chongyun: ...R—Really? I just don't want to disappoint them...
 Just treat it as if you're getting together with friends.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 15.ogg Chongyun: I see... But my friends aren't the type who'd go out and play...
 Don't worry. I've got you covered.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 16.ogg Chongyun: Great! That's reassuring.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 17.ogg Chongyun: Alright, let's give it a try.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 18.ogg Chongyun: But I'll need you to help me if I don't know what to do.
(After returning to the kids)
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 09.ogg Little Le: Yay, they're back! So can we go play now?
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 19.ogg Chongyun: Uh, yeah... I'll try.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 10.ogg Little Le: Hahaha, yay! No need to be nervous... we're gonna have a blast!
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 11.ogg Little Le: Um... Oh, I know! Um — let's play hide-and-seek! Um — you'll be the ghost... But — um — don't peek until you count to fifty!
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 20.ogg Chongyun: Wh—Who? Me?
 He might not be familiar with the rules.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 12.ogg Little Le: Huh? I don't know anyone who doesn't know how to play hide-and-seek. Uh... okay, you can be the ghost then!
 Let me play the ghost first.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 long 10.ogg Dalong: Okay. We'll go hide now. You'll have to find all three of us if you wanna win!
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 13.ogg Little Le: Hehe, you'll never be able to find me!
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 21.ogg Chongyun: You mean, we just hide anywhere we want?
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 14.ogg Little Le: Of course, silly! That's the most fun part of the game!
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 15.ogg Little Le: But don't follow me! There's only room for one person in my secret hiding spot!
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 22.ogg Chongyun: Uhh, alright... but I still don't really know what to do.
 Don't be so serious.
 Just use your imagination.
 Who knows, maybe you'll be good at this.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 chongyun 23.ogg Chongyun: You're right. I'll give it a try.
Media:vo cycop001 1902501 littlele 16.ogg Little Le: Yay! Let's go hide! No peeking now...
After counting to fifty...

(Find Dalong)
Media:vo cycop001 1902506 long 01.ogg Dalong: Ah, you found me!
Media:vo cycop001 1902506 long 02.ogg Dalong: I can't believe I lost! I didn't expect you to be so good at this.
(Find Little Le)
Media:vo cycop001 1902507 littlele 01.ogg Little Le: Huh, you found me!? How did you know to look for me here...
Media:vo cycop001 1902507 littlele 02.ogg Little Le: Heyyyy — you didn't peek, did you?
(Find Little Le if you found Chongyun first)
Media:vo cycop001 1902507 littlele 03.ogg Little Le: Aw, the popsicle man is a ghost now, too!
Media:vo cycop001 1902507 littlele 04.ogg Little Le: How did you know to look for me here...
Media:vo cycop001 1902507 littlele 05.ogg Little Le: You didn't peek, did you?
Media:vo cycop001 1902507 littlele 06.ogg Little Le: ...Did the popsicle man tell you where to find me?
(Find Chongyun)
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: I never expected you to find me so easily...
 It's only your first time.
 ...Why would you hide here?
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: I thought that this would be the perfect spot.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: In fact, I'm well-versed in the methods of locating evil spirits, and I have lots of experience tracking down their hiding spots.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: This spot is dusty and a bit gloomy, which gives off an unsettling energy. Evil spirits usually prefer such places.
 You're trying to use thaumaturgy to play hide-and-seek...
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: Yeah... I guess my experience as an exorcist doesn't apply very well.
 But you can be easily seen here.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: Hmm... I guess I was so nervous that I neglected the most important thing.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: Since I've been found, I guess I must admit my defeat.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: It's a simple game, yet quite intriguing once you begin to play.
 Maybe we could play it together again sometime.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: Sure, we could invite more friends to join us.
 Good thing you weren't the ghost.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 10.ogg Chongyun: Hehe, right. It might've taken me hours to find anyone.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 11.ogg Chongyun: Let's go.
(After finding everyone)
After a few rounds of hide-and-seek, everyone returns to the kids' home.
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 littlele 01.ogg Little Le: Hmm... Mommy's still not back yet. I'm starving...
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 littlele 02.ogg Little Le: Do you two know how to cook at all?
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 long 01a.ogg Dalong: Don't be so selfish. They've played with us for a long time already.
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 littlele 03.ogg Little Le: ...If we played for so long, then a little longer won't hurt...
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: No, it's alright. But I'm not too picky about the taste of food, as long as it doesn't make me feel unwell.
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 littlele 04.ogg Little Le: Unwell? A—Are you sick? Mommy says you should always take care of yourself!
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: No, it's not so serious. I just need to be careful about what I eat.
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: For example, Noodles with Mountain Delicacies. The dish tastes great, but I can't eat anything warm. So I came up with my own variation called "Cold Noodles with Mountain Delicacies."
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 littlele 05.ogg Little Le: C—Cold noodles! That sounds nice and cool. I wanna try!
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: Well, I don't think they taste quite as good as when they're served warm.
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 littlele 06.ogg Little Le: No way, I'm sure it's just as good as the popsicles! Or even better!
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: Uh, well...
 It's your time to shine! I'll help prepare the ingredients.
 I happen to have some ingredients here.
 I want to try some, too!
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: Y—You want to try too? Okay, I guess I'll have to make it.
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: Hmm, alright. We can use the kitchen here. I'll prepare the noodles once all the ingredients are ready.

(Talk to Little Le again)
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 littlele 07.ogg Little Le: Cold noodles! Cold noodles!
Media:vo cycop001 1902503 long 02.ogg Dalong: I've never tasted cold noodles, I can't wait to try some...
(Talk to Chongyun again)
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 12.ogg Chongyun: Are all the ingredients ready?
(Opens the submission menu)
Chongyun uses the ingredients to make "Cold Noodles with Mountain Delicacies."
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 13.ogg Chongyun: So? How does it taste?
 It's delicious.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 14.ogg Chongyun: *sigh* That's a relief. I'm glad you like it.
 It's unique. The texture is different compared to warm noodles.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 15.ogg Chongyun: Unique? I guess I'll take that as a compliment...
 You should open a restaurant!
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 16.ogg Chongyun: Ah, y—you flatter me! No need to exaggerate, though.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 17.ogg Chongyun: Let's serve the dish to the kids.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 18.ogg Chongyun: I hope they'll like it.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 long 01.ogg Dalong: Wow, it tastes amazing! I've never had anything like this before.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 littlele 01.ogg Little Le: You're not only a hero b—but also a chef! What a surprise!
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 long 02.ogg Dalong: Is there more? I want seconds!
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 littlele 02.ogg Little Le: Me too! Me too!
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 19.ogg Chongyun: Whoa, slow down there! There's plenty more.
The two kids enjoy a big meal.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 long 03.ogg Dalong: Ugh, I'm so full... You're so amazing!
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 littlele 03.ogg Little Le: Now that we're done, let's play more games!
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 20.ogg Chongyun: M—More games?
 Seems you're becoming quite popular.
 Seems you're quite likable after all.
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 chongyun 21.ogg Chongyun: This is completely unexpected for me. I was sure that everyone would just think I'm boring...
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 littlele 04.ogg Little Le: No way! You're so much fun. And if you weren't so icy all the time, you'd be even more fun!
Media:vo cycop001 1902504 littlele 05.ogg Little Le: C'mon let's go, I wanna play something else!

But it would be a shame to leave without having found any evil spirits. And so you forge on alone, leaving Chongyun behind to rest.
No Wasted Effort[]

(Approach Zhouliang)
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 01.ogg Zhouliang: Ugh... I'm beat. Finally, I can take a break.
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 02.ogg Zhouliang: *sigh* I wonder if I took things a little too far... A few people seemed scared out of their minds.
 Who are you?
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 03.ogg Zhouliang: Huh? Hey, you shouldn't be here!
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 04.ogg Zhouliang: *sigh* Never mind. I assume you overheard me anyway.
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 05.ogg Zhouliang: I work here pretending to be a ghost, but now's my break time, so I took off my costume. I get all hot and stuffy wearing that thing...
 So there are no real ghosts here?
 It's all planned to scare people. right?
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 06.ogg Zhouliang: Of course, how could there be real ghosts here?
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 07.ogg Zhouliang: No one wants to see a real ghost, neither us nor the participants.
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 08.ogg Zhouliang: They just come here for the atmosphere, or should I say, the chance... Everyone wants the chance to feel the thrill of excitement.
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 09.ogg Zhouliang: When people find themselves in a scary situation, they'll say things that they'd never dare to otherwise. That's what the Test of Courage is all about.
 I think I understand.
 (Chongyun will be very disappointed.)
Media:vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 10.ogg Zhouliang: *sigh* Okay... I should get back to work now. Hope you and... whoever you're here with have a fun time.

Nothing Going Bump After All...[]

(Talk to Chongyun)
Media:vo cycop001 1903109 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: You're back! So how did it go? Did you see an evil spirit...?
 No, I only saw an event staff member pretending to be a ghost.
Media:vo cycop001 1903109 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: Huh...? So that's what's going on here!?
Media:vo cycop001 1903109 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: No evil spirits...? No danger...? It's all just a setup...?
 It's just for entertainment, you took it way too seriously.
 I'm sorry, but that seems to be the truth.
 That's all there is to the Test of Courage.
Media:vo cycop001 1903109 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: I—I see... it seems I've been tricked again.
Media:vo cycop001 1903109 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: Uh oh, I'm starting to feel more and more... uncomfortable.
Media:vo cycop001 1903109 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: Now that everything's settled here... let's head back to Liyue Harbor.
Media:vo cycop001 1903109 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: But could you... help me walk back?
 You don't look so good.
Media:vo cycop001 1903109 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: It's fine... I'll be okay...
Media:vo cycop001 1903109 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: No, really... I'm fine...

Yun Jin's Offstage Break[]
 Quest DescriptionYun Jin declines a great number of invitations to spend a laid-back day with you at Chihu Rock...

(Go to Chihu Rock)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904001 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Mmmm...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904001 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: I can smell the fragrance of food in the air. Yes, Chihu Rock is definitely the place to go after a performance.
 Are you taking me to Third-Round Knockout?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904001 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: Oh? So you're a regular in Chihu Rock too, huh.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904001 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: Third-Round Knockout has a great view. It's the perfect place to drink some tea and listen to a good story. It's also a favorite of one of my most faithful audience members.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904001 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: But at the same time... it's lacking a little pizzazz.
 Are you taking me to Wanmin Restaurant?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904001 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: Oh? You're a fan of Chef Mao's cooking, too?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904001 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: Wanmin Restaurant's Black-Back Perch Stew is hot, spicy, and fresh... but it's not kind on the throat, so unfortunately I can't eat much of it.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904001 yunjin 08.ogg Yun Jin: Also, it's a bit cramped in there... I prefer open-air restaurants.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904001 yunjin 09.ogg Yun Jin: Hey, have you been to Chen the Sharp's place before? His Grilled Tiger Fish is the best around.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904001 yunjin 10.ogg Yun Jin: Third-Round Knockout and Wanmin Restaurant are both great restaurants... But when it comes to barbecue, this is the place to go.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904001 yunjin 11.ogg Yun Jin: Enjoying some nice food and drink sitting by the hot coals in the cool breeze...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904001 yunjin 12.ogg Yun Jin: Hehe, let's go!

(Talk to Chen the Sharp)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 chenthesharp 01.ogg Chen the Sharp: Tiger Fish... Grilled Tiger Fish, hot off the grill...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 chenthesharp 02.ogg Chen the Sharp: Oh, hey there! Is this a Ms. Yun which I see before me? It's been a while! What'll it be — the usual?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Yes, please. I'm out with my friend today. Let's start with a plate of stir-fried meat and a handful of skewers...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: And of course, some Grilled Tiger Fish... Two please, one with just a hint of chili...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: And the other one... Uh...
 Just however it's normally seasoned.
 Extra chili, please.
 Same as yours.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 chenthesharp 03.ogg Chen the Sharp: Got it. Your Grilled Tiger Fish will be ready soon.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 chenthesharp 04.ogg Chen the Sharp: Do you want any drinks with that?
 You serve drinks here?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 chenthesharp 05.ogg Chen the Sharp: Yeah, I don't advertise it though, because it's just something I'm experimenting around with for fun.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 chenthesharp 06.ogg Chen the Sharp: Ms. Yun likes a drink with her barbecue, so I ended up getting her to try them out for me.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 chenthesharp 07.ogg Chen the Sharp: So, would you two like some tea, or...?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm... anything new?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 chenthesharp 08.ogg Chen the Sharp: Well, I managed to scrounge some milk from Dongsheng next door...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 chenthesharp 09.ogg Chen the Sharp: A merchant from Mondstadt told me a while back that there's this popular drink doing the rounds there, called, uh... milk tea?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 chenthesharp 10.ogg Chen the Sharp: I tried my hand at making it too, but the response has been, uh... kinda lukewarm. It's still way off being ready to add to my menu...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: Tea with milk...? Sorry — milk tea? It might not be the best thing for my throat, but... If I'm just having a little taste, I mean... I think it should be fine?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: Oh, but what about you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? Anything you want to drink?
 Milk tea.
 Milk.
 Tea.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: Okay, let's get yours in first, and then... Um...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 08.ogg Yun Jin: I'll have one of each, if that's alright. I'd like to try them all.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 chenthesharp 11.ogg Chen the Sharp: Okey-dokey. And here's your Tiger Fish, fresh off the grill!
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 09.ogg Yun Jin: Come on, let's enjoy it while it's still hot. Piping hot barbecue and a nice cool drink is the best sensation.
You have some barbeque with Yun Jin...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 10.ogg Yun Jin: Mmmm... That was great.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 11.ogg Yun Jin: Shame about these drinks though... I only had a little sip of each one, so there's a lot leftover...
 What do you want to do with the rest?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 12.ogg Yun Jin: Well... I mean, I could just drink them. But they're a little bland for me, nothing that special.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 13.ogg Yun Jin: I guess he must have toned down the flavors to make them palatable for a wider range of customers. We could just... add some flavor back in...?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 14.ogg Yun Jin: Oh, I got it — have you ever heard of the Hot Pot Game?
 Surely not...
 No way...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 15.ogg Yun Jin: Let's play the hot pot game with the leftover drinks!
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 16.ogg Yun Jin: I'll add some extra ingredients based on my tastes, then you try to guess what I added. Sound good?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 17.ogg Yun Jin: Don't worry, after mixing in the new ingredients, I'll also drink half. So I won't add any weird stuff.
 Are you sure this is how the hot pot game is played...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904002 yunjin 18.ogg Yun Jin: Ah, we don't need to worry about every last detail. C'mon, I'll go grab some ingredients from the shop next door. Once you've psyched yourself up, come and join me.

(Talk to Yun Jin)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904003 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Okay. Get ready... Oh, and no peeking.
 (Avoid her gaze.)
 (Take a sneak peek.)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904003 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: It's ready. Let me try it first.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904003 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: *glug-glug*... hmm. Pretty good. Your turn.
(If you take a sneak peek)

Thoughts: (I didn't get a good look... Do I savor it or knock it back?)
(If you avoid her gaze)

Thoughts: (Yun Jin seemed to react okay... Do I savor it or knock it back?)
 (Knock it back.)
 (Savor the flavor.)
(Dialogue continues randomly to Variation A, B, or C)

Variation A[]

Taste: (Nothing at first, but then a tidal wave of umami with a whiff of the sea.)
 (Have another taste.)
Taste: (There was something solid floating in the drink. It tasted great and refreshing...)
 (Really savor it.)
(If you choose to knock it back, the dialogue starts from here)
Taste: (The complex flavors of a rich soup hit the back of your throat.)
 How did you drink this with a straight face!?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904003 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: Huh? Oh, just regular facial expression control.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904003 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: Besides, it's nothing that unusual. I think it tastes okay... doesn't it?
 It's more of a soup than a drink...
 But amazingly, it actually tastes pretty good...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904003 yunjin 08.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm-hmm. So, did you work out what ingredients I added?
 Crab Roe, Tofu, and Salt...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: You guessed them all correctly! You seem to have a well-developed palate.
 Crab Roe, Rice, and Salt...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: Close, but not quite.
 Matsutake, Tofu, and Salt...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: Close, but not quite.
(Dialogue continues to On Stage and Behind the Scenes)

Variation B[]

Taste: (It has a smooth texture and a rich, dairy taste...)
 (Have another taste.)
Taste: (It seems to hiding the distinctive flavor of some kind of spice.)
 (Really savor it.)
(If you choose to knock it back, the dialogue starts from here)
Taste: (A syrupy sweetness hits the back of your throat.)
 How did you drink this with a straight face!?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904003 yunjin 14.ogg Yun Jin: Huh? Oh, just regular facial expression control.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904003 yunjin 15.ogg Yun Jin: Besides, it's nothing that unusual. I think it tastes okay... doesn't it?
 Once you get over the surprise...
 It actually tastes pretty good...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904003 yunjin 16.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm-hmm. So, did you work out what ingredients I added?
 Mushrooms, Pepper, Sugar...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: Close, but not quite.
 Cream, Onion, Sugar...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: Close, but not quite.
 Cream, Pepper, Sugar...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: You guessed them all correctly! You seem to have a well-developed palate.
(Dialogue continues to On Stage and Behind the Scenes)

Variation C[]

Taste: (You feel a kind of icy texture in your mouth.)
 (Have another taste.)
Taste: (You can feel a sweet and sour flavor on the tip of your tongue, with a fruity finish.)
 (Really savor it.)
(If you choose to knock it back, the dialogue starts from here)
Taste: (It's gooey and hard to swallow. But there's something familiar about this viscosity.)
 How did you drink this with a straight face!?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904003 yunjin 22.ogg Yun Jin: Huh? Oh, just regular facial expression control.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904003 yunjin 23.ogg Yun Jin: Besides, it's nothing that unusual. I think it tastes okay... doesn't it?
 So am I just used to eating this stuff now...?
 Amazingly, it actually tastes pretty good...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904003 yunjin 24.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm-hmm. So, did you work out what ingredients I added?
 Mint, Sugar, Slime Condensate...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: Close, but not quite.
 Mint, Jam, Slime Condensate...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: You guessed them all correctly! You seem to have a well-developed palate.
 Qingxin, Jam, Slime Condensate...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: Close, but not quite.
(Dialogue continues to On Stage and Behind the Scenes)

On Stage and Behind the Scenes[]

Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 09.ogg Yun Jin: We can try some more combinations next time, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 10.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm... I wonder what kind of new flavors I could create with some more traditional teas, like Pine Nectar or Snow Blossom?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 11.ogg Yun Jin: I can't wait to try it out. I'm getting excited just thinking about it.
 I never thought this is what you would be like offstage...
 The real you and the characters you play are nothing alike...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 12.ogg Yun Jin: Huh. Well, people do often say that getting deep into a character is about identifying the part of you that is similar to them and bringing that into the performance.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 13.ogg Yun Jin: So in that sense, I can't say it's incorrect to conflate an actor and the characters they play on some level.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 14.ogg Yun Jin: But there are many more sides of me than the few you see on stage. So ultimately, yes, I am not the same person onstage as I am offstage.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 15.ogg Yun Jin: Sometimes when I get letters from people, I can tell from the way they write that they see me as someone cold and aloof.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 16.ogg Yun Jin: I can write back, but I have to be very careful about what I say. Likewise, when I get invited along to banquets and so on, I have to make sure to keep myself calm and composed the whole night...
 That's a shame. Your offstage personality is definitely the cuter one.
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 Your onstage persona is more striking. That's unavoidable.
(Proceed to Branch 2)

Branch 1[]

 That's a shame. Your offstage personality is definitely the cuter one.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 30.ogg Yun Jin: Ahem! I bought you one drink, okay? That's not a license for you to start saying weird stuff like that!
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 31.ogg Yun Jin: Uhh... well, never mind. You seemed like you were being sincere. I'll let it go.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 32.ogg Yun Jin: All I was trying to say is that everyone has many different sides to their personality, and if you get fixated on just one of those, there's so much you'll never discover about a person.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 33.ogg Yun Jin: I mean, if we hadn't had the chance to hang out and chat like this tonight, there are things about you I might never have gotten to see...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 34.ogg Yun Jin: ...Like the mighty and distinguished Traveler diligently reviewing my hot-pot drinks.
 And I would've assumed you were serious all the time...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 35.ogg Yun Jin: Me, serious? Onstage, I guess. But offstage...
 And I would've assumed you were a stuffy thespian type...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 36.ogg Yun Jin: Hehe... Mm, "thespian" maybe, but I don't think I'm old enough to be called "stuffy" just yet...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 37.ogg Yun Jin: Just think of me as another one of your friends. Just one who happens to have a flair for the dramatic.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 38.ogg Yun Jin: So, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) — what shall we do next? Something to remember today by?
 Let's get a photo!
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 39.ogg Yun Jin: Get a photo? You mean, capture this happy moment for posterity, so we can look back on it later?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 40.ogg Yun Jin: Sounds great. Let's use today's food stand as a background then.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 41.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm... now how should I pose...
(Proceed to Commemorative Photo)

Commemorative Photo[]

(Talk to Yun Jin, optional)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904050 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm... Yes, like this. I'm ready, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).

(After taking the photo)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904005 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm-hmm, it looks good. I hope whenever you look at this photo in the future, it will remind you of the good time we had today.
 So... goodbye for now?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904005 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: Hold on.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904005 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: How is one photo going to be enough? We'll both need one if we want something to remember each other by.
 Right. You have a point.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904005 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: You take this one, and I'll take another photo of you.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904005 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: But (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), could you find another location for us? I'm thinking somewhere around Feiyun Slope with a good view.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904005 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: I'll join you in a moment. I have something to prepare here first.


 Step DescriptionYou have one round of great conversation. Yun Jin suggests taking a commemorative photo for you as well...

(At the location)
You wait a while...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904006 yunjin 01.ogg Yun Jin: Sorry to keep you waiting so long.
 I wasn't waiting long at all.
 What did you have to get ready?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904006 yunjin 02.ogg Yun Jin: Hehe, you'll see.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904006 yunjin 03.ogg Yun Jin: The view here is great. The lights, the buildings... It's the ideal spot. I can see you chose it carefully.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904006 yunjin 04.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm... Yes, this angle is perfect.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904006 yunjin 05.ogg Yun Jin: Okay, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), strike a pose and close your eyes.
 Close my eyes? For a photo?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904006 yunjin 06.ogg Yun Jin: Yes please. Quickly now.
You close your eyes...
Listen: (You hear a series of creaking sounds, like a wooden stand being unfolded and landing on the ground.)
Listen: (Then you hear some light footsteps, followed by Yun Jin's voice right by your ear.)
Media:vo yjcop001 1904006 yunjin 07.ogg Yun Jin: Get ready...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904006 yunjin 08.ogg Yun Jin: Three, two, one...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904006 yunjin 09.ogg Yun Jin: Open your eyes.

Branch 2[]

 Your onstage persona is more striking. That's unavoidable.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 17.ogg Yun Jin: ...You think so? So you prefer the way I am onstage, too?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 18.ogg Yun Jin: It's fair enough. After all, every detail of my onstage presence, from the songs to the costumes and makeup, is carefully crafted for maximum appeal...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 19.ogg Yun Jin: And I've worked hard to try and cultivate an image that appeals to everyone, regardless of age or gender.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 20.ogg Yun Jin: But if I can't lighten up and joke around even with my closest friends when I'm offstage... that's a real bummer.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 21.ogg Yun Jin: ...Never mind. Talking about this is just gonna kill the mood.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 22.ogg Yun Jin: Tonight was about me showing my gratitude to you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). So did you have a good time? Is there anything else you want?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 23.ogg Yun Jin: Like... something to remember the evening by? A souvenir, perhaps? Anything you can think of?
 ...An autographed photo of you?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 24.ogg Yun Jin: ...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 25.ogg Yun Jin: ... *sigh*
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 26.ogg Yun Jin: Okay. Here you go.
 You had one prepared already?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 27.ogg Yun Jin: Well, people ask me for autographs all the time. Usually, what they want is a signed picture of me onstage. Apparently, that makes it more valuable...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 28.ogg Yun Jin: Yunning suggested that I keep a bunch of them on hand at all times to make things easier.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 dongsheng 01.ogg Dongsheng: Ah, yes, that one is a picture from "The Divine Damsel of Devastation."
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 dongsheng 02.ogg Dongsheng: Hehe, I have one just like it on my wall at home.
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 chenthesharp 01.ogg Chen the Sharp: Hey, are you guys talking about Ms. Yun's autographed photos?
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 chenthesharp 02.ogg Chen the Sharp: Haha, I have one in the store, too.
 So everyone has one...
Media:vo yjcop001 1904004 yunjin 29.ogg Yun Jin: Well, what do you think? Is this souvenir valuable enough for you?

In the Master's Image[]

Media:vo noecop002 1909101 beatrice 01.ogg Beatrice: ...I'm sorry, Marjorie. I was focused solely on chatting with Quinn... I didn't see anything else at all.
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 beatrice 02.ogg Beatrice: If you're out of other options, maybe you could get help from the knights? I'm sure if Master Jean heard about it, she'd help you find it in no time!
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 01.ogg Marjorie: Thanks. I'll check with a few more people first... If no one has seen it, then I guess I'll just have to ask the knights.
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 beatrice 03.ogg Beatrice: Alright, well, I hope it turns up soon. Bye now.
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 02.ogg Marjorie: *sigh* Maybe I should just tell the Knights already...
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Ms. Marjorie, are you in need of assistance?
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 03.ogg Marjorie: Oh, Noelle! Since you asked... I seem to have misplaced a monocle that I imported from Sumeru.
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 04.ogg Marjorie: I was organizing the stock that had just arrived, and because the monocle was so fragile, I took it out, wiped it, and put it aside.
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 05.ogg Marjorie: But then, I went to get it after I was done with the stock, and it was gone!
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 06.ogg Marjorie: I've asked around, but no one seems to have any idea where it could be...
 Has anything like this happened before?
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 07.ogg Marjorie: Anything like this? Well... It's not completely unheard-of. You know my store — there are all sorts of exotic items...
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 08.ogg Marjorie: In the past, I've lost a carved wooden perch and some boneware, but as soon as I reported them missing to the Knights, they were recovered right away.
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: May I ask... Where were the missing items recovered from?
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 09.ogg Marjorie: Oh... The wooden perch was mistaken for a real fish by Margaret's cat, and as for the boneware... They eventually found that in a dog kennel somewhere outside the city.
 Reminds me of some commissions once involving a missing cat and some tax returns...
 With people calling on the knights for so many things, it's no wonder Jean is so busy...
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Oh no... We mustn't increase Jean's workload any further!
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Master Jean's time should be spent on more important things.
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Ms. Marjorie... Would you mind letting me help you find the missing monocle?
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: I may not be as efficient as Master Jean, but I will do my very best to help you find it!
 I will help too.
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 10.ogg Marjorie: Oh? Of course that's okay. ...Isn't asking Noelle the same thing as asking the Knights?
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Heh... (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), I'd better gather some more information before heading out.
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: As well as confirming some details regarding the monocle itself... We should find out as much as possible from Marjorie about the circumstances under which it went missing.
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 11.ogg Marjorie: So, do you have some ideas on where to start? Ask me whatever you wanna know, I'll answer to the best of my memory.
 What can you tell us about the missing item?
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 12.ogg Marjorie: The missing item... Well, it's a monocle, to start with. And since it came from Sumeru, the design should be fairly recognizable.
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 13.ogg Marjorie: As for other distinguishing features... it's very light and it's very small...
 Did you see anything?
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 14.ogg Marjorie: Hmm... I had my head down, and I was busy working through the stock. I didn't see anything that was going on around me...
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 15.ogg Marjorie: But this street is so busy that surely someone would have noticed if it had been stolen?
 Did you hear anything?
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 16.ogg Marjorie: Oh! Now that you mention it... I do remember hearing some kind of flapping sound...
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 17.ogg Marjorie: The sound went as soon as it came, and I was focused on checking if anyone had seen anything, so I didn't give it too much thought at the time... Do you think it could be connected?
 Maybe we can investigate in the direction in which the noise disappeared.
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 18.ogg Marjorie: Hmm... I heard it first behind me, and then it seemed to fade out in a northwesterly direction. Now I wish I'd followed the sound and spoken to people along the way.
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), shall we go head in that direction and make some inquiries? Maybe we'll find some clues.
(Talk to Marjorie again)
Media:vo noecop002 1909101 marjorie 19.ogg Marjorie: Like I said, the noise was headed... northwest, I think? Good luck finding the monocle... I'm counting on you.
(Talk to Alfry)
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 alfry 01.ogg Alfry: A missing monocle and a flapping sound? ...First I've heard of anything like that...
(Talk to Margaret)
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 margaret 01.ogg Margaret: A missing monocle, you say? I don't recall my child bringing anything like that back home.
(Talk to Raymond)
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 raymond 01.ogg Raymond: A flapping sound? Sorry, I wasn't on patrol nearby at the time of the incident... But if you need any backup, please send for me at any time.
(Talk to Glory)
Media:vo noecop002 1909102 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Excuse me, Glory. Have you heard anything that might be described as a flapping sound in this area recently?
Media:vo noecop002 1909102 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Marjorie's monocle has gone missing from her shop. We are trying to look for clues...
Media:vo noecop002 1909102 glory 01.ogg Glory: Flapping sound? Yes, I think so...
Media:vo noecop002 1909102 glory 02.ogg Glory: I believe it was the sound of a finch flapping its wings.
Media:vo noecop002 1909102 glory 03.ogg Glory: It sounded a lot heavier today than usual... as if it was carrying something.
Media:vo noecop002 1909102 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: So... Maybe the finch took the monocle back to its nest?
Media:vo noecop002 1909102 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: I've seen their nests in the past on occasion, while I'm cleaning the roof... What do you say we have a look, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
Media:vo noecop002 1909102 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Finally, we have a lead to go on. Thank you, Glory!
Media:vo noecop002 1909102 glory 04.ogg Glory: You are welcome! May you swiftly recover the lost item by the grace of the Anemo Archon.
(Talk to Glory again)
Media:vo noecop002 1909102 glory 05.ogg Glory: By the grace of the Anemo Archon, may you swiftly find the lost item.
(Climb onto the rooftop and look for a Finch nest)

(Interact with the wrong nest)
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 24.ogg Noelle: I don't think it's here...
 
(Interact with the wrong nest)
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 25.ogg Noelle: Hmm... No, it doesn't seem to be here.
 
(Interact with the correct nest)
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 26.ogg Noelle: We found it! This must be Miss Marjorie's missing monocle.
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 27.ogg Noelle: Let's take it back to her right away. I hope we haven't kept her waiting too long...
(Talk to Marjorie)
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Miss Marjorie, here. We found your monocle.
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 marjorie 01.ogg Marjorie: Wow, you were so quick. How wonderful! I thought I wouldn't be hearing back for a few days yet.
 A few days? That long?
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 marjorie 02.ogg Marjorie: Sure, in the past when I've lost something and asked the Knights for help, it can take them a while to get around to it...
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 marjorie 03.ogg Marjorie: After all, the Knights have all sorts of things to be getting on with, big and small. No matter how capable Jean might be, she can't be in two places at once, can she?
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 marjorie 04.ogg Marjorie: Thanks to you, Noelle, we don't have to trouble the Knights with everything little thing that comes up.
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 marjorie 05.ogg Marjorie: Heh, now I think about it... Noelle is basically like another Jean... In that sense, it really does feel like Jean can be in two places at once.
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: No, surely you can't be serious! How can I compare to Master Jean...
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: I can only help people with small things... like finding lost property.
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 marjorie 06.ogg Marjorie: Aha, whether it's big or small, it's all the same to us: things we can't handle by ourselves.
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 marjorie 07.ogg Marjorie: Noelle, once you've qualified as an official Knight... Will that mean you won't have time to help us anymore? I for one am going to miss you...
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: No, not at all. If I do become a knight in the future...
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: I will continue to help everyone with their problems!
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 marjorie 08.ogg Marjorie: ...I was just kidding! Keep up the good work, Noelle!
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 marjorie 09.ogg Marjorie: I am sure everyone in Mondstadt can't wait to see the kind of knight you become!
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: I... I will keep working hard!
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 marjorie 10.ogg Marjorie: Thanks again! Ugh, I suppose I should put this in a secure place this time...

 Noelle, you seem quite pleased!

Media:vo noecop002 1909103 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Yes... Maybe it's because I am not afraid anymore...
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: I've never dared to imagine myself as a knight before... I always feared that the higher my expectations, the more disappointed I will be if I don't live up to them...
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: But... Let's say I do become a knight in the future, maybe... Maybe I will simply continue to do the same things that I am doing right now?
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: It doesn't matter to me how small these things are, or how tiring...
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: I do these things not because I am a maid, but because of my own will.
 Noelle, just be the kind of knight that you want to be.
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: Yes, there is no need to become someone else, nor worry about failing... As long as I perform better in my next exam than in my previous one...
Media:vo noecop002 1909103 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: ...Then one day, I will become a knight that I can be proud of.
