There is a saying that "excellent marksmen are raised on a diet of bullets," indicating that the cost of cultivating such talent is astounding. The use of such devices ensures that the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol conducts effective training for marksmen while reducing the cost of training munitions.

It is said that this building was designed with sufficient space for the installation of automation equipment, with various connections and pipeline channels reserved to make future upgrades to the production equipment much easier, resulting in the entire structure being modular to some degree.Additionally, the Court of Fontaine has adopted strict standards on waste emissions, so the chimney-like structures above workshops are actually equipment that filters and pressurizes waste emissions, and stores them in liquid form. The residue and gas emission from smelting is processed multiple times to remove all harmful substances for reuse in the production of slag cement — a common construction material in Fontaine. Material produced in this manner only requires a rest period and a suitable coat of paint to make them completely harmless to the human body. It's a perfect example of proper resource recycling.

This wooden plate contains Zaytun Peaches, albeit ones that are not yet ripe...Zaytun Peaches do indeed have a rather firm texture, though their circumstances are a little different in the searing deserts. For if one buys fully ripened Zaytun Peaches from Caravan Ribat, they would have already lost most of their moisture to the hot weather by the time they get to Aaru Village — indeed, they might even have rotted by then.As such, the villagers and the caravan merchants came together to think of a storage solution — first, they would wash as-yet unripe Peaches and scatter some specially-blended spices over them, before allowing them to soak inside barrels of wine. This way, all that is needed will be to bring the Zaytun Peaches back to Aaru Village before leaving them be for a while until the light alcohol on the surface volatilizes, thus giving the fruits a texture almost identical to what they would have had if freshly-picked and ripe. And if eaten the moment they are taken out from the wine barrel, one will get a uniquely crisp and refreshing flavor — a true Aaru Village special found nowhere else.

Poisson's residents are largely engaged in water-related occupations such as fishing and salvaging. The nature of these jobs means that their workplaces are not entirely fixed and often require the setting up of temporary sheds in the wilderness. However, typical tent structures do not adequately meet their need to withstand unpredictable winds and waves. Thus, temporary sheds with metal construction have emerged. It's worth noting that these sheds often feature a fish-shaped metal sign, one that is not to be mocked anywhere out in the wilds of Fontaine.

Some ancestors of Chenyu Vale believed that the roots of such trees could wrap around and encircle the rock and stone, hence the unique appellation "Stoneshrouding."

Even if a particularly ignorant criminal dared to take a shot at robbing the Confrerie, they would find the windows impervious to their tools. In contrast, even a grocery store's wall would warp if hammered repeatedly.Supposedly, using an identical design as other stores is the confrerie's marketing ploy to attract various consumers. After all, overly lavish storefronts tend to intimidate and discourage customers on a budget. A "relatively normal" appearance would make the store seem more approachable, or at least entice customers to come inside and browse.

From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.Compared to other mass-produced models, this special "Gold Leader" assistance meka utilizes a clear gold outer casing along with special control equipment. The project team designed it to fulfill the role of a command relay station in particularly complex underwater environments, receiving and re-transmitting commands from the controller to all other meka within the group, effectively fulfilling the important role of leader.However, as the whole maintenance meka project stopped functioning, these leader meka lost their reason for existence.

Its durability against both high and low temperatures, as well as bumps, has also been significantly increased. This is all thanks to the introduction of techniques from Liyue. After the Akademiya set restrictions on the price of clay, merchants had to discover other ways to make profits. Some of them had traveled afar to Liyue and noticed the similarities in the production between Liyue porcelain and Sumeru pottery. Hence, they spent a fortune purchasing the technical know-how behind Liyue-style porcelain, which later took Sumeru pottery into a brand new era. Of course, the pottery pieces made with such techniques were branded as imported luxury items by these merchants. The necessary techniques were not uploaded via the Akademiya to the Akasha System, which explains why glazed pottery was not a household item in the beginning.

A round carpet with water-blue suede and a golden, symmetrical pattern found in hotels within the Court of Fontaine. The carpet's pattern is said to have yielded extraordinary results during a particularly tricky business negotiation. Its designer divided the carpet into eight segments with exactly equal dimensions. This ensured the area in which each of the four particpants [sic] was seated felt identical, and prevented them from influencing one another. Along with the peaceful conclusion of the negotiations, the practice of using a circle divided into eight equal segments as a metaphor for equality started to spread as well, until finally, it could be seen in any venue where business negotiations are often held.

This type of note holder can often be found in Fontaine, and can be used to hang different types of notes or documents.The original specialized note holder was an incidental invention by a research group at the Fontaine Research Institute. The design's purpose was to accurately track the progress of various tasks. Therefore, the holder comes equipped with eight sections, divided along three different classification markers: "completed or incomplete," "important or not important," and "urgent or not urgent." However, this "standard" note holder has proved too complex, since ordinary citizens generally do not categorize their notes in such detail. As a result, the "universal" or "common-use" type with only two sections has become a common sight in stores.

Following the principle of "establishing a semblance of order no matter what," the Palais Mermonia made revisions to city ordinances, regulating the locations and manner in which such boards could appear....But when they were done, and announced the measures to the public, they found that the phenomenon then significantly decreased throughout the Court.

They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates.Compared to the other batch-produced models, these special limited-edition "Platinum Collection" meks stand out with their clean and bright casing. When trying to attract support from wealthy merchants for the Maintenance Mek project, the development team would send them a fish tank containing one of these exquisite contraptions as a gift – and fine gifts they were indeed! Unfortunately, none of these attempts worked, so the development team adjusted their plans and tried to sell them off as toys to make up for the lack of project funds instead.In the end, due to the accident that we all remember, the whole development team was dismissed and all of their future projects were canceled. At present, all of the remaining Maintenance Meks in Fontaine are totally unsupervised, and the "Platinum Collection" batch are no exception – they have all been lost to the water. Disappearing completely off the radar, they have turned out to be the most unique and expensive "fishes" in Fontaine. According to an in-depth investigation and cross-examination of the existing data by journalists of The Steambird, "the deployment of Maintenance Meks has not made any significant difference to the pollution levels of Fontaine's waters, and the effect of the project is still in question." Nowadays, surviving "Platinum Collection" meks still wander the waters of Fontaine, and they are considered among the most prized of catches.

Ornamental_Snowstrider : Ornamental Fish

A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Pool of Sapphire Grace and Shaded Clarity.A rare stickleback that only dwells in snowy, mountainous regions. It is quite possibly due to this that it has a much cooler temperament as compared to other sticklebacks. This species has a unusually great love for the bitter cold, almost as if they were parent and child. Though they can live in warmer waters, but any removal from such conditions is like striking a spiritual blow to them, and they will become depressed and refuse to multiply."Not a recommended catch." — Angler's Atlas, Snowstrider Chapter

But during such times, Sumpter Beasts do also use their bodies to block the sunlight for these merchants, thus providing a measure of shade.

Save for a few rare and precious tree types, the people of Liyue are accustomed to using broad-reaching collective terms for trees and aren't so fussy about the exact species of tree included. For example, trees with straight trunks are referred to by the more sophisticated-sounding term "Irontrunk."Because the trunk of the Amber Irontrunk Tree is so straight, some adventurers use it to make wooden weaponry so that they can practice with each other and hone their fighting skills.Whether this kind of training comes in handy when the time comes to brandish a real weapon and face off against a formidable foe is hard to say.

As such, these fences are but a boundary marker at best.A certain superintendent of the Police Station once said that such fences were only meant to send a message to the people. If even the Police Station had to be walled and fenced all-around with a double guard all year round, then would this not indicate that Inazuma City's security at large was woefully lacking? On the other hand, should the fences be open on all sides, even seeming nigh defenseless, the people would have confidence that the city's security was well in hand. I mean, there's no way the walls could have been constructed this way due to an oversight... Right?

However, this proved ineffective, as most people on the streets were in a hurry and uneager to accept some mysterious piece of paper thrust upon them by a stranger, never mind read it carefully. But just as everyone was at a loss, some promoters noticed that pedestrians sitting on benches were more inclined to read newspapers voluntarily. Therefore, they proposed that newspapers should not be forcibly handed to busy passersby, but should be placed in fixed facilities for people to read at leisure. The book and newspaper racks now scattered throughout the streets and alleys of Fontaine are the concrete realization of that brainwave.

A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Pool of Sapphire Grace and Shaded Clarity.A fish with unique morphology and Fontaine's cousin to the butterfly fish.

Legend has it that the first fishermen to catch this fish had their rods tilted at the end of the tail fin and found that the two, when combined, resemble a polearm, hence giving rise to the name "Axe Marlin." This name has made much more of an impression than its scientific name, the "Anchor Hook Butterfly," and it is thus colloquially used amongst most people.It is said that these sea-blue Axe Marlins were a special type that migrated from Sumeru to Fontaine. Compared to their more mild-tempered cousins in Sumeru, Streaming Axe Marlins are tougher and can survive in far more inhospitable environments.

However, their dire nature could not hold the attention of passers-by, and some felt that they were not effective at getting their message across.So a young official in the Shogunate, who was deeply influenced by the Yae Publishing House's works, suggested that people be allowed to leave messages on the notice board to drive up interest. It worked. As it turned out, people often enjoy leaving messages after eating and drinking in the city, and the interest in the notice boards increased dramatically, thus allowing more serious messages to reach more of the city.

Ornamental_Maintenance_Mek:_Situation_Controller : Ornamental Fish

A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Pool of Sapphire Grace and Shaded Clarity.Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates. From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.Equipped with high-sensitivity sensors, the meka can efficiently "nose out" target items through smells as well as detect the optical characteristics of underwater junk. As a result, they can be attracted by certain types of bait and are occasionally caught by anglers, who refer to them as "Water Maintenance Fish" or "Iron Fish."Under certain conditions, Maintenance Meks will treat the food of some underwater creatures as targets to be cleaned, and thus sometimes find themselves embroiled in conflicts in which they are at a disadvantage due to their small size and lack of power. Over time, an increasing number were being damaged as a result. To protect the previous two models and ensure safe cleaning, researchers utilized existent frameworks and did their best to increase the power density of core structures. In the end, they developed a third model with certain combat capabilities, which was primarily designed to drive away underwater creatures by ramming into them. The new model was rapidly manufactured on the basis of previous processes.However, the plan to further enhance "Situation Controllers" was suddenly terminated by the Fontaine Research Institute. After all, if these little things were capable of driving ferocious underwater creatures away, then what were all the other underwater meka for? In reality, these "Situation Controllers" were of no real use against the underwater creatures that actually posed a threat to the other meka, and could only deal with common fishes and damage the ecosystem. As a result, researchers had to shut down some of them intentionally and restrict their offensive capabilities.

A heavy round shield, which looks like a regular round shield but in fact conceals a hidden secret.Athel Wood of moderate age and sturdy quality is selected and cut into planks of precise size and thickness. Smoking, waxing, and other processes will increase the planks' hardness to their greatest extent, before mortise and tenon structures are used to join them together. They are then affixed on three relatively light and soft backplanes to form a double-layer composite structure, which tries to wear down incoming blades and arrows to the greatest extent possible, weakening their power and absorbing their impact. At the same time, the frame is covered with a rigid iron structure, while reinforcing structures are placed at the vertex of the shield arc to resist the impact of blunt objects and opposing shields — and with that, the shield is complete.Such shields are said to be able to fend off any attack from anyone without a Vision. Their price is also equivalent to dozens of ordinary weapons, which limits their users to small numbers of Eremite or Corps of Thirty elite troops.Treasure Hoarders, who prioritize the lightness of their equipment, can't comprehend why a sellsword would invest so much in a shield like this. Only a select few frontline mercenaries and the designer of this shield type understand the importance of such equipment. As a reckless youth, the shield designer once led an incursion into Aaru Village in search of his colleagues' nemesis, only to be defeated by a young guard. With a shield in her left hand and a spear in her right, the guard with heterochromatic eyes was a human avalanche, shattering the intruders' weapons and defensive equipment alike in a single charge, knocking them out with just the right amount of force, before handing them over to the aged guards, admonishing them, and releasing them. The shield's designer, though now reformed and no longer a criminal, still remembers the young guard with her differently-colored eyes, regarding her as the strongest warrior he has ever met. She was the reference point from which the principle of "the greatest offense is the greatest defense" was used to transform this venerable shield design into this style of round shield.And who knows? Perhaps it may yet withstand one of her blows should they ever meet again...

This model was made in imitation of just one particular type of such machine, with a set of Pneumousia-powered anchoring hooks being built into its base, allowing it to, as the name "Rockcracker" suggests, break into and hold onto any ground it needs to.One thing to note is that once it has anchored itself in place, it no longer needs any Pneumousia machines to keep it in place.

A hut that may be found in Aaru Village. It has a sand-colored roof and the shade it provides is quite ample indeed. It is said that such roofs were first built for the guards near the village entrance. One of the scholars temporarily dwelling in Aaru Village once suggested this: "If we use vibrant colors for the guardhouse roof, people can quickly find them and thus locate those who can help them easily." Yellow objects are, in theory, quite striking, but in a place such as the desert, it is doomed to simply melt into the sandy backdrop...Fortunately, the guards do not simply stand guard in one place, and these huts would later be repurposed, never again to become a thorn in the side of those seeking help.

Their dorsal and ventral fins are comprised of flexible bones that are as slender as feathers, hence why researchers proposed the name "Heartfeather Bass."As an important subspecies of the Heartfeather Bass family, Rippling Heartfeather Bass are much better at swimming than their appearance suggests – they can even travel across roaring waves. It is said that their fins produce a rippling sound when they swim above the water against the current. Identifying the fish is already extremely challenging given their protective coloration, so most anglers have never heard this unique sound with their own ears.

Though "flower" paints have the word flower in them, they tend to really be extracted from derivatives of common plants, such as Lavender Melon skins. Of course, some high-class paints do use traditional flowers as their base material. The source of the latter comes from items such as underwater colored stone and fish scales. There is no real difference in the price ranges of the two different types. Instead, the artist will choose between the two styles based on their understanding of the work they are doing. And since this drawing's theme is about rivers and streams, then one must naturally turn to the "water" colors to set the scene.

In the past, products made from fur tended to be quite expensive. Now, however, some desert settlements have adopted more efficient collection and management of animal pelts, leading to increased production of all kinds of furs, including this carpet.

An orderly arrangement of round tables and stools made from Fragrant Cedar Wood. It is usually set up close to the stage for guests to sip tea while listening to opera. It is said that Yun-Han Opera Troupe has an unspoken rule: the sitting order of guests present is arranged randomly.Guests with a wealthy background are not able to book the front seats, and the common people are also able to get seats that are closest to the stage. Sometimes, guests who came together would end up being seated separately, but they did not complain. After all, when the performer on stage puts on a brilliant performance, the audience would give their undivided attention and naturally will not have time to make small talk with other guests at the same table.

To express her gratitude for your assistance with the testing of the "Remelting Tablets," she gifted it to you as some sort of teaware that you may brew your tea with. Since it can transfer heat in a rapid and balanced manner, it can actually help release the utmost flavor of some high-end tea leaves. However, due to its reasonably unorthodox structure, it can be slightly inconvenient to pour tea with while keeping the leaves inside when compared with everyday teapots. Some may argue, though, that it confers an "academic sense of ceremony" upon the process.

Heavier armor provided more protection, yes, but it was a huge drain on the wearer's stamina and could not be put on quickly.The Shogun's army, equipped with such sturdy armor, was able to achieve battlefield superiority against the resistance for a time. Unfortunately, the samurai could not wear their armor indefinitely, and the resistance leadership caught on to the weaknesses in reaction and preparation time that these suits of armor imposed, engaging them with multiple forces on different fronts and using harassing tactics that forced the Shogunate forces many times into battles where there was no time to put their armor on. Subsequently, the Shogun's army also gradually switched to using lighter gear that allowed them to react quickly and engage the enemy flexibly.

The meat is fatty and rich, but if it's not handled properly, or you remove its gallbladder too late, the fish's meat will be as sour as unripe fruit. Therefore, "making this fish delicious" has become the standard by which all chefs are measured.

An agile and wise soul, endowed since birth with a well-maintained elegance and pride.These cats are conscientious and cautious, elite hunters amongst their kind.

With nothing better to do, these jobless "sheriff cats" find renewed fulfillment in encouraging others of their kin to move and exercise.

Made from the finest Linden Wood and covered with a uniquely-styled tablecloth which has been coated with a thin layer of wax by clockwork meka. This coat provides a splash-resistant surface that can be easily cleaned with water without leaving visible stains. Legend has it that this waxing process was inspired by the fishers of Poisson. They discovered a long time ago that applying wax to ship sails prevented staining and excessive water absorption during rainy weather.However, with the advent of new devices to power ships, fewer Poisson residents are familiar with this process, and fewer still are concerned with the history of a tablecloth's finishing technique.

Its extremely extraordinary size can easily accommodate multiple large Ornamental Fish inside. Word has it that a certain senior angler spent a fortune on the tank so as to better appreciate the magnificent fish he had caught. Experts were specially hired to design the tank, the making of which even utilized Fontaine's most advanced technologies to fashion the tank out of a single piece of glass. Two pieces of curved glass bent at different angles were then used to form the sides of the fish tank, such that the size of the fish inside might be optically shrunk, allowing onlookers to move their eyes less when admiring his beloved fish.It's just that such large pieces of glass are of fairly limited strength. Therefore, it would be unwise to tamper with the irritable kinds inside the fish tank, such as Betta, or else you will probably have to spend the whole day rescuing the dying fish, picking up glass shards, and cleaning up the floor.

Given that its practicality, aesthetics, and affordability are perfectly balanced, people tend to bring it along as a gift when visiting family and friends.It is said that a famous dancer at Zubayr Theater once paid a visit to the pottery shop and gazed at the amazing assortment of colorful pottery. Some theater fans thus reckoned that the dancer was fond of exquisite pottery pieces, and together, they purchased a large number of luxurious pottery vases as a gift to the theater to show their support. In the end, all the vases were returned, and the dancer, together with everyone at Zubayr Theater, wrote a thank-you letter to the fans, briefly explaining the whole story: the dancer was trying to grasp the beauty of the pottery's form by observing its colors and patterns, rather than wanting to purchase the pottery itself.

They are not legendary weapons, for sure, but they are certainly no worse than high-quality equipment one can find on the market.Some knights once found the following clause within an old edition of the rulebooks — "Feel free to use these weapons in case of an emergency."However, these arms have incredible proportions and weight, and ordinary knights cannot use them at all, with some reckless young people almost causing alarmingly dangerous incidents.As such, the new rulebooks now contain no such clause.

A stall where carpets, tapestries, and finished fabrics are displayed for sale. Such stalls are often seen in many stores in the Grand Bazaar. Diverse textiles of rich patterns and beautiful colors fascinate tourists and trigger a bulk-purchase impulse. Thanks to the popularization of weaving machinery techniques, quality carpets can be seen in almost every Sumeru household. Carpets have also become an important part of interior design in Sumeru, and the academic discussions surrounding them are legion — such as pattern design in aesthetics studies and dyeing material enhancement in chemistry studies, and overviews on the development of the textile industry and weaving machinery. Once, a self-claimed "senior" researcher in machinery even had an intense academic argument with an architecture researcher over a related discussion in front of a textile stall. Their argument ended up with both sides "agreeing to disagree," which was later deemed as a classic example of "rational discussion" between researchers.

A shed with a Karmaphala Wood structure. It was first used as a fruit vendor's stall. The fabric on the top seems commonplace, but it is actually an application of the Amurta school's research findings. According to these findings, prolonged exposure to sunlight and long-term storage in the darkness may both cause a loss of key flavors in fruits and vegetables. Based on this knowledge, Amurta school's researchers studied the properties of different textiles before selecting one that had optimum translucency. They then recommended that sheds be topped by such textiles for vendors to ensure minimum flavor loss during sales. Fruit and vegetable vendors found such sheds quite helpful. Many other shop owners would later begin to use them as well.

Thanks to the strict aromatic standards of a previous owner of Café Lucerne, and with the help of The Steambird and protests from many others in the industry throughout the city, researchers dared not ignore the issue and began researching an improved formula that removed the lingering odor.

Ornamental_Maintenance_Mek:_Initial_Configuration : Ornamental Fish

A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Pool of Sapphire Grace and Shaded Clarity.Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates. From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.Equipped with high-sensitivity sensors, the meka can efficiently "nose out" target items through smells as well as detect the optical characteristics of underwater junk. As a result, they can be attracted by certain types of bait and are occasionally caught by anglers, who refer to them as "Water Maintenance Fish" or "Iron Fish."Made of light wood and cheap metal, this model represents the first batch of Maintenance Mek produced after achieving reliable manufacture, and possesses the fundamental capabilities required to fulfill the purpose for which they were designed. Their lifespan, however, is somewhat limited. To make up for that, this model was released in great numbers, and they work in "group shifts" – when one group stops functioning after reaching the end of their life cycle, another group that has been deployed underwater beforehand is then activated and takes the next shift. In the eyes of ordinary people, these "Iron Fishes" seem to be able to reproduce themselves in a never-ending stream. Catching a few of them from time to time is certainly no cause for a guilty conscience.

This is by and large an accurate assessment of its character as well: dull, slow, and lazy. However, few people know that this rather silly exterior hides a killer technique — this fish is capable of sucking water into its body before expelling it like a cannonball from its mouth with such force and pinpoint accuracy that even fishermen might be stunned by it.

It might even be used for complex time planning or to assist in some special calculations...This device also makes for a lovely table decoration. For display purposes, however, the rings are locked and will not rotate.

The briefcase used by the General Mahamatra Cyno has an approximately cylindrical cross section and has ornaments that signify its status. This briefcase can hold more documents and implements than the standard style that the Akademiya uses. Of course, the need to use so many objects in a single investigation indicates that the task is of such extreme complexity that only a few people in the Akademiya can accomplish it — chief among them, of course, being General Mahamatra Cyno.The briefcase's large size has also been an encumbrance: Every time Cyno leaves the house with this briefcase, he will invariably be spotted by various people, and word will quickly spread that "the General Mahamatra is off on official duty," which can get in the way of his investigations. As such, Cyno often takes advantage of this notion by going out empty-handed and acting like he's not working, which can catch his targets off guard, or by taking the briefcase to the tavern to sit at a table for a long game of Genius Invokation TCG until any onlookers tire of watching him. With time, the briefcase has thus come to symbolize the "unpredictable work hours of the General Mahamatra."

A large doll in the shape of a tanuki, which can never be pushed down, is based on a character from one of the popular light novels by Yae Publishing House:A chef who accidentally acquired divine power and is able to release a "Real Cooking Skills" barrier, in which other chefs will lose all their means of cheap tricks and can only compete with their competitors with their real skills. At that time, this character will be able to win the cooking showdown with their solid foundation.This doll is ranked 22nd in sales among all light novel derivative products by Yae Publishing House and is occasionally sold at festival booths. Logically speaking, as a derivative product that is the protagonist of the work, its sales should be very high. However, after investigation, it is clear that most of the readers who like this character are chefs with mediocre skills. Perhaps the target audience of this character is slightly skewed...

In theory, the purpose of these carts is to hold food that can't fit on the table. However, the tables for customers are quite large and the cart is only needed when numerous patrons get together to order bottle after bottle of low-alcohol beverages and dish after dish of food as an accompaniment. As Margaret never intended The Cat's Tail to be a beer and wine dispensary, the cart was ultimately reused as a snack holder for Genius Invokation TCG players. However, in the heat of the match, players usually can't even think about eating, so most dishes laid upon the cart are cold platters.

As one gazes at this roof from afar, it is almost as if some delicious taste is already developing at the tip of one's tongue. It can also exert an appetizing effect in advance when it comes to snacks — an example of using visuals to one's advantage.The only issue is that some birds that love to pick Valberries might come along and peck small holes in the roof. "Whenever Paimon gets up there to chase those birds off, she ends up getting taken for a ride by them and not catching a single one — something that makes her mad enough to stomp about for quite a while.""But every time I suggest that I could just throw Paimon up there, which should give her the initial speed she needs to catch those rascals, she refuses."

As such, when they were trying to figure out how thick to make these walls, they once asked the village guards to get into formation and slam into the walls using their shields. If the wall could withstand many such impacts yet not show any cracks, it would pass this strength test. However, this standard is no longer considered suitable when it becomes to buildings created in recent times, for a certain girl with two differently-colored eyes has joined the ranks of the guards. Were she to join such a test, one shudders to think how thick a wall would have to be to withstand her...

A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Pool of Sapphire Grace and Shaded Clarity.A fish with unique morphology and Sumeru's cousin to the butterfly fish. This fish has a broad skeleton and a unique curved body. Legend has it that the first fishermen to catch this fish had their rods tilted at the end of the tail fin and found that the two, when combined, resemble a polearm, hence giving rise to the name "Axe Marlin." This name has made much more of an impression than its scientific name, the "Anchor Hook Butterfly," and it is thus colloquially used amongst most people.Although its namesake is a weapon, and its strength surpasses that of many other fish, Axe Marlin mostly have a kind personality, especially those with blue and gold stripes on the body. Due to their hard scales and big size, Axe Marlins are able to handle attacks from other aquatic creatures, waiting until their attacker is exhausted and leaves.Their strength can also prove challenging for a master fisherman, whose only choice is to treat them as large beasts — to drain their stamina more efficiently and eventually catch them, one must go all out the moment an Axe Marlin bites."

A pair of enraged wood-carved eyes that can be used to assemble an "Aranara Carving."It was modeled after the eyes of the Eremite captain Feroz in Port Ormos. Parents in Port Ormos always tell their children to stay away from Feroz, lest they pick up any of his foul language. Nevertheless, such restrictions have instead triggered the youngsters' curiosity, tremendously increasing Feroz's popularity among them — him and his malicious eyes both.

Instead, their intent is simply to use the white noise from the flowing waterfall to drown out all other ambient noises, thus allowing them to achieve a unique form of "silence."Medical theories from other nations have also indicated that sitting under waterfalls for too long might actually result in some strange trauma injuries.

A research group at the Fontaine Research Institute believes that in architecture, courtyards can be likened to the canvas used in paintings. Buildings, sculptures, fountains, and so on — each represents different geometric shapes in one's image composition, and linear elements like corridors and pathways play a crucial role in connecting these shapes. Even though individual "lines" may appear less frequently on the canvas, they are essential in dividing the space up while shaping the overall aesthetic. These "lines" are just as precious as Mora, thus resulting in the term "The Mora Dividend."

With some adjustments, you can create designs with wonderful symmetries. That researcher, now a Scribe at the Akademiya, has declined to comment on the story, but this anecdote has been told many times over by merchants to emphasize the magnificence of the carpets' patterns.

Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka groups, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates. From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.Legend has it that when maintenance meks were initially deployed, researchers made various demos to prove the technology for organizations like the Fishing Association, providing demo types along with instruction manuals. This was to explain the origin and features of this fish-shaped meka to the people of Fontaine, ensuring people wouldn't be confused or harmed when seeing them. However, the aggressiveness of the meka was overestimated, and the skill of the anglers underrated. With the disbandment of the maintenance project team, these technical demo meka are but decorations, offering a glimpse into the intriguing technological development of Fontaine.

The roof uses a unique dye that is said that originated in the blue and purple plants found only on the island — the villagers would gather up dry grass and fallen leaves and maximize their use, and thus they would use "the years the grass and leaves have witnessed" to paint the roofs of their homes. Today, the dye-work is a lot less troublesome and certainly lacks the weight of those early days, but the people of Bourou Village have never stopped being fond of this color, which has become a hallmark of Watatsumi in its own right.

So fireplaces are important to desert settlements like Aaru Village. To reduce the hassle of lighting the fireplace at a specific time, a process was developed to treat the firewood with the roots of various desert plants. The processed firewood can burn long enough to keep the house comfortably warm both during the day and at night, and therefore saves people much trouble.

"These plants have incredible skin elasticity and are filled with gaseous material. If one wishes to experience the world through the eyes of a 'Ruin Drake: Skywatch,' perhaps one might consider jumping atop some of these plants."The latest edition of the matra manual has this to say concerning this species of desert shrub.Like the discussion about the incense, this description also doesn't seem to have any practical impact on operations. Some matra did try the instructions out for themselves, eventually concluding that "these plants aren't half bad as cushions" — save for the one person who tried stepping on this cushion 20,003 times, the final time upon which it exploded, sending that person flying into the air.One day, one young subordinate, unable to contain their curiosity, brought a heavily-annotated manual to the General Mahamatra with the following two questions: "which botanist did you ask to help with the manual?" and "what is the deeper meaning behind some of these seemingly simple and relaxed descriptions?"At this time, the General Mahamatra was in Gandharva Ville talking to a certain Forest Watcher with long upright ears. Hearing those questions, he finished his meal before telling two jokes that were no different from his usual fare with a completely straight face, leaving his young subordinate stunned for quite a while. Seeing their confusion, the General Mahamatra seemed ready to give a yet more detailed explanation, only for the Forest Watcher to quickly speak up, saying that "You see, he just needs to write a few things to adjust the mood a bit. If you didn't understand what was being said, then it wasn't that important. And if you didn't find those descriptions funny, then there's no need to remember them!"Ending the conversation hastily, this young subordinate would keep the Forest Watcher's words firmly in mind, and even shared them with their colleagues. Unfortunately, it seems that even today, these poor matra still have not yet fully understood the meaning of those words.

They grow vigorously when the snow melts in the early spring and are notable amongst people for their "thrice-dyed crimson" hue.Like another plant species with a pinkish-red color, it is said to be related to the Divine Priestess. Some Watatsumi Islanders believe that each time the Divine Priestess prays for her people, one plant will be transformed to have this coloration by her power. As such, some of them will take the leaves of such plants with them as talismans, carrying them on their persons all the time.

An exquisite vertical machine. It appears to have only a wooden frame, but there is far more to it. The winding fabric cantilever at the top rotates slowly, releasing the fabric threads as needed as driven by hidden components, weaving fine textures and patterns in such a way that the pattern seems to be slowly "drawn" out. This is exactly the machine that the Kshahrewar designed in pursuit of higher productivity, and has become rather popular in Sumeru in less than one hundred years, greatly enriching the fabric market.Nevertheless, someone who claims to be a senior researcher but has the appearance of a teenage girl said that they were inspired by some ancient mechanism. This scholar marveled at the mechanism when she first saw it. She said she was going to buy it to bring back for research purposes, but then she heard from others that "there are mechanisms like these everywhere. What's so special about this one?" Embarrassed and red in the face, she left immediately.

"I wish that the weather won't be too hot on the days where I don't sleep well..."If the young woman who struggled to sleep entered the desert on the first evening to observe the stars, she would struggle to return by the second afternoon. Whenever she passed the Wall of Samiel's gate in her ragged state, she would often find a golden leaf of a certain plant caught in her luggage or her hair. This gold frightened her a little, for if the sky was akin to the color of these leaves, that could only mean that the sunlight this day would be exceedingly strong — torment indeed for those who lacked physical strength yet still had to trek through the desert. Such was her fear that she would subconsciously walk around any such plants of this kind that she might pass by.

However, due to the insufficient content of certain minerals in such materials and the limitations of their craftsmanship, the lifespan of the pottery pieces produced then was fairly limited.

Furthermore, if conflict were to rise with the Maison Gardiennage or if a clockwork meka were to go out of control, half the building could easily be destroyed. Thus, the Adventurers' Guild was willing to invest a huge sum in a strong structure utilizing a metal frame.When asked about it, the members of the Adventurers' Guild refused to comment on this or just responded with blank expressions.

These traditional roadblocks are used to delineate prohibited areas in peacetime, but they serve as the basic unit of a defensive line during wartime. Due to the high-density Adhigama Wood used and the addition of very large metal spikes, the weight of this roadblock is frighteningly heavy, enough to stop the head-on charge of a Sumpter Beast. As such, these roadblocks are often dismantled and moved around, set up only when they are needed.That said, there was a certain mercenary with long black-and-golden hair who once opined that "defensive lines were made to be broken," breaking through such obstacles en route to tearing the opposing side's defenses to shreds. This incident was so significant that even her colleagues started to consider installing some strengthening metal structures at the intersection of these roadblocks in order to deal with foes as powerful as her.

You can combine these placements with pre-existing furnishings within the Serenitea Pot to hide the Tubbers, after which you will have to search for these Tubbers within a time limit.After hearing about Mondstadt's traditional game, Windtrace, from the Traveler, Tubby also resolved to create a game based around hide-and-seek, thus creating this particular furnishing combination. However, such a game that only involved Tubby, the Traveler, and Paimon would have too few people and thus lack a certain fun factor. As such, Tubby created many "Confuzzled Tubber" toys to play the role of other participants. Tubby even suggested that the Traveler could use adeptal energies to create playing fields and invite friends to come and experience the fun together.It seems that Tubby shares senses with the Confuzzled Tubbers, which can allow her to drink tea in peace within her teacup while enjoying the games.Not that this has anything to do with Tubby growing both tubbier and lazier lately, of course.

It is made of lightly-scented Cuihua Wood and has a rather ingenious design that takes both its main uses — a site for Genius Invokation TCG matches and a tavern table — into account. Although the main support structure of this round table is in the middle, it will never have trouble remaining stable no matter how worn it is. This is thanks to Margaret, the owner of the tavern, having stressed the various use cases of such tables while speaking to the craftspeople. For example, it has to be able to withstand a heavy fall by someone defeated in a TCG match, or the slam of hands on the table by drunk customers tickled pink by a friend's humor... And most importantly of all, it has to be able to hold the bulk of The Cat's Tail's collection of rather sturdy feline specimens as they leap from table to floor to table, and survive any incidental impacts that might occur as they play. As for the high costs that came with the reinforcement of the tables' central structures... Well, so long as the cats are happy, there's no price too high!

Its well-divided internal space can provide long-term accommodation for five to six single residents. Although its appearance is extremely plain, this building was actually one of the first to use the mature form of slag cement in its construction.According to legend, the craftspeople of Fontaine attempted to promote Tearstone construction throughout Fontaine after the completion of the Opera Epiclese. Unfortunately, the extremely high costs that came with Tearstone were beyond the means of most Fontainians.So, they found a project team at the Fontaine Research Institute and requested the development of a construction material with similar strength to Tearstone that would be affordable for the general public. The researchers traveled in search of inspiration and finally found it in the process of smelting. They set out to design a "stone" that solidifies from a liquid form, and after decades of trial and error, they finally invented a cheap and resource-efficient material — slag cement.

The staff specifically selected flower subspecies that were large and with distinctive aromas, after taking into consideration how their color palette would complement the aesthetics of their location. These plants are strategically placed at locations crucial to air circulation, allowing their light fragrances to swiftly permeate the city. As a result, the Court of Fontaine has received high praise from foreign gourmets critics who refer to it as "a city of sensory pleasures." Some even attempted to commission a confectioner to create an oversized cake in the shape of the Court of Fontaine with the primary scents derived from extracts of these very flowers.

A bulk-manufactured awning produced with the assistance of clockwork meka that, theoretically, should be in the royal purple-blue hue of a Lumidouce Bell. In reality, most of those who see it have the same reaction: "It's obviously cyan!"The reason for that is simple: When the clockwork meka was dyeing the material, a deviation occurred that never would have happened with human artisans. The clockwork meka used can only follow commands and repeat the production process, with no one to verify the final results of the dyeing process. The workers assembling the awnings afterward just followed their instructions and also failed to notice the color issue. When the designer finally saw the finished product, such a large quantity had already been produced as to making scrapping the project unfeasible. After making sure there were no quality issues, they were sold normally.This case became the subject of a paper from a certain research team at the Fontaine Research Institute, and subsequently became a key argument for the necessity of human supervision in clockwork meka-assisted production.

After consulting with the Hydro Eidolon staff and Idyia herself regarding its intended usage, the director realized that since the mechanism would only see limited exposure during the play itself. "In that case, why not make it cuter, so that maybe we can use it in other productions too!" And thus, the big-eyed birds of the night, owls, were used as the basis for the mechanism. However, due to budgetary constraints and the limited labor available, this mechanism has only been used in one production...

In some establishments, these couches might also be used as a small stage for their instruments.

The trade-off, of course, is that such tents are only waterproof for a short time. The structure is not very strong, and a small collision from a common wild animal or even a bird leaping from the treetops might break it apart. Only the most daring adventurers would dare to spend the night alone in such a tent like a sellsword on a brief stay in the rainforest. Mercenaries are usually hardy and carry dry food with them, and do not care about the difficulty of storing supplies in the tents.

A tent like the ones seen in the Kujou Encampment. Its roofing is quite gently sloped and is enjoined to one wall, which can make it seem a little odd, but there is a special consideration at play here — for shots fired from long or middling range, the silhouettes of such barracks are quite small, thus making them less likely to be hit. Even when they are hit, there is a good chance that the projectiles will bounce off the sloped roof. The wood on the roof has been specially treated such that it does not ignite easily, thus effectively invalidating fire-based tactics. The weaknesses of this design, however, are the sizable sacrifices made to interior space and therefore comfort.

A shrub cultivated by Fontainian gardeners that has a lovely shape and an enticing fragrance. Perhaps it was the vibrant shade or its striking scent, but a local tabloid once confidently claimed that they contained a certain slow-acting poison. According to that tabloid, people who lingered near these flowers for too long might experience physical issues such as insomnia, irritability, and swollen and painful eyes. After some time, another obscure tabloid asserted that a famous opera singer regularly consumed flower tea made from these flowers, this being the secret to the star's lasting youth.For a time, there was heated debate amongst some Fontainians about these flowers and the relevant departments of the Palais Mermonia responsible for the city's landscaping. Some actively avoided these flowers, while others secretly wanted to take some home to cultivate them...With few other options, the Palais had to invite a specialist in botany to write a seven-day editorial series on The Steambird, clearing up all the falsehoods and emphasizing that this type of flower was just ornamental, and had no other deeper impact on residents' lives apart from the lifting of their spirits.Nowadays, these purple flowers also adorn the area before the Opera Epiclese's gates, and the rocky period these flowers underwent has long passed, thanks to the efforts of various parties.However, some novelists drew great inspiration from this particular farce. These folk with their fine humor wrote a series of related short-form novels on the theme of "perilous flowers," with a particularly popular one being "Peaceful Day Nine," which featured poisonous flowers as a means of committing a devious crime, and mentioned that the original form of the dangerous plant was that very same controversial shrub from before.To avoid causing the same trouble as before, the author emphasized the following at the start of said story:"This is entirely a work of fiction!""...Nonetheless, the author is not encouraging you or your family members to consume this flower."

At this time, the guard with two differently-colored eyes was not even eight years old, and when the people crowded around her and the warehouse doors were opened, they discovered that a ridiculously long spear rested against the wall. The wooden floorboards were dented by its sheer weight, and the spear's point was almost poking through the ceiling.What? Was this some sort of strength-training tool? A performance prop intended to catch the eyes of onlookers? Or just some obstacle intentionally placed in the path of the test-taker?Yet the little guard said she did not mind, and simply carried the long spear out as if it were just another day. Deftly she hurled the spear, and what did they know? It landed just half a pace further than the previous Guardian's recordAfter this incident, some obstinate former Guardians never again said a word of doubt against that young girl.

The Violetgold Angler Gull is a medium-sized seabird with violet and gold plumage whose primary habitat is in Fontaine.They are not a timid bird species and have been known to snatch greasy food from the hands of passersby at the port. Sometimes, they are even bold enough to try stealing fresh catch from fishing boats.On the bright side, after they stole Tubby's snacks, Tubby furiously threw huge teacup lids at them. Every single lid struck home, shooting down its intended target. Now, the Violetgold Angler Gulls living in the Serenitea Pot are much better behaved, and the worst mischief they get up to is flocking together to discuss "how to get Tubby to give them some snacks."

One of the standard commercial buildings in the Court of Fontaine. It is a product of early forays into modular architecture, and an example given in the Court of Fontaine Standards for Exterior Wall Decorations. Once construction using slag cement matured, architects believed rapid assembly of houses on a large scale was possible by making all the load-bearing walls in advance and using large clockwork meka to assist in construction.However, despite many attempts to adjust the coloration, an icy cold and gloomy gray were the only possible outcomes for slag cement. Housing and indoor architecture would be far too plain if built like that, and so light yellow bricks are still necessary for the exterior wall panels while tiles or wood flooring are required indoors. Thus, concerns about aesthetics and livability won out over the time savings promised by modular construction. Thus, the architects turned to another form of modular construction design that focused on structure and reserving space for internal piping.Of course, even if the architects succeed, there may not be much demand in Fontaine unless the Fontaine Research Institute is rebuilt — which is another complicated issue in itself...

This in turn would turn the product into a pricey collector's item, thus depriving it of any practical use whatsoever. Fortunately, the upgrading of production equipment that the Kshahrewar Darshan has promoted has decreased the difficulty of manufacturing utensils of various kinds. At this point, they have already become quite common, such that these lovely yet functional items have even found a home in Aaru Village, lacking in material wealth though it is.

This in turn has given rise to some conversations that go something like "Hey, is it just me, or is the blue on your fish washing off?" In response, the Ministry of Civil Affairs specifically posted this notice: "The market is a wet and wild place. Beware of influxes of blue fish."

A standard Fontainian coastal street light often found lining the paths in areas such as the Opera Epiclese and Romaritime Harbor. Unlike the standard street lights used in the Court of Fontaine, this street light uses stronger materials, and its relatively shorter and solid pole is better able to resist the erosive properties of the noticeably salty sea winds by the coast. But even with its special design, these street lights require much more frequent maintenance than their counterparts in the Court of Fontaine.

Ornamental_Formalo_Ray : Ornamental Fish

A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Pool of Sapphire Grace and Shaded Clarity.A strange cartilaginous fish that was once thought to be a fantastical creature, only recorded in some ancient scrolls of art on Watatsumi Island. As the seal over Enkanomiya was opened, their true forms were laid bare before the eyes of all.It is said that the bodily forms of these curious creatures will change color as time passes. When they are young, they are as gold as sunlight. Later in life, however, their colors deepen, and their two 'wings' will be colored with a purple as deep as the night. Rays at this stage of life earned the name "Formalo" in those ancient scrolls, which means "the maw of greed."

Ornamental_Maintenance_Mek:_Water_Body_Cleaner : Ornamental Fish

A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Pool of Sapphire Grace and Shaded Clarity.Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates. From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.Equipped with high-sensitivity sensors, the meka can efficiently "nose out" target items through smells as well as detect the optical characteristics of underwater junk. As a result, they can be attracted by certain types of bait and are occasionally caught by anglers, who refer to them as "Water Maintenance Fish" or "Iron Fish."Compared to the mass-deployed "Initial Configuration" model, the "Water Body Cleaner" model is more mature and coated with erosion-resistant material. The researchers responsible for this project introduced periodic callback and maintenance instead of just leaving them on their own after release. They would send out homing signals through flashing of a certain frequency in order to retrieve the meka, which they would then release again following maintenance and examination. Over time, certain individuals began to use this flashing method as a type of "bait" to catch these meka, and it is now widely known among the angling community.

Perhaps it was due to the inhospitable nature of the area towards plant growth, or the rainforest proving poor soil for heavy excavation and mining, but clay was brought from the deserts by merchants for the longest time, and those who sold clay thus made a fortune, attracting more people to the business and causing the price of clay to soar continuously.

When in use, the relevant goods could be placed directly under it to then be lifted.However, the load-bearing capacity of the door frame could not meet the lifting requirements, and its loading and unloading efficiency proved unsatisfactory. The rate at which the device rusted when exposed to moisture for prolonged periods also exceeded initial expectations, with the potential for additional maintenance costs to arise in the future...Taking these various factors into account, the residents of Poisson decided to ask the overly confident engineer to leave after settling the payment.The manufactured prototypes were not directly discarded, however.

For example, they can be found coming to the rescue of Crabs who have fallen into holes, before pulling the insensate Quicksand Eel out of those very same holes.

Legend has it that performers of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe would sit on these benches to take a break after everything was ready, or to watch the performance from behind the curtain. More often than not, however, these benches are reserved for enthusiastic guests — there are usually not enough seats around the round tables when it comes to formal performances. In such circumstances, Yun-Han Opera Troupe will add such benches at its discretion to make the most of the venue and allow more people to enjoy the opera without disturbing each other.

It is said that at the time when carpets were becoming very widespread, artisans tried to paint landscapes, birds, animals, and even respectable figures on carpets, but one researcher raised a crucial question - "Isn't it inappropriate to trample on images of humans and beautiful things?" Thus, none of those ideas came to fruition in the end, and the Akademiya instead decided on using geometric patterns for carpet patterns in order to strike a balance between aesthetics and intellectual connotations.

Or rather, no one would have, if not for the keen senses Guardian  [sic] with the mismatched eyes, who managed to find the lost child by daybreak, just in the nick of time. Though his family scolded him harshly, the Guardian patiently explained what the merchants were storing in their homes. The latter method of teaching worked much better, for now that the child's curiosity was sated, his more outrageous fantasies disappeared, and no other children would make this mistake from then on, or trouble the other villagers in such a manner.

The exterior wall is made of beautiful and economic light yellow bricks that are produced from processed Tearstone. The main frame of the building is made from Cypress Wood supplemented with slag cement, a new material developed by the Fontaine Research Institute before the incident, giving it a very long lifespan.The Fontaine Research Institute was researching a unique method of construction — using a metal frame and cement to create a new wood-free building. These buildings would remain standing even if the Emperor of Fire and Iron caused a ruckus on the roof. However, Fontaine lacks the resources to produce the requisite quantities of metal with high enough load-bearing strength. For this reason, mass production of things such as clockwork meka was given priority for Fontaine's metallurgic resources. In light of this, construction with a metal frame and slag cement has not gained widespread popularity.

But as a matter of fact, compared with the earliest glazed pottery pieces, it is already much less expensive, all thanks to a certain marvelous traveling merchant.Her business perspective was quite unique, having a sharper sense of the balance between profits and sales, and she despised her competitors, who made glazed pottery affordable only to a tiny number of people through endless price hikes. With the help of Canned Knowledge, she was able to impart secret new ways of processing clay to the potters in town while stipulating the suggested retail price of glazed pottery in her agreements, which would also earn her a fair sum for each piece successfully sold. Only within a few years, she defeated all her competitors utterly and made a huge fortune out of this, all while making glazed pottery much more available to ordinary households. The whole affair went on so quietly that even to this day, the merchants who used to sell glazed pottery as luxury items cannot figure out where went wrong. From their points of view, the potters all "suddenly received guidance from an expert and disrupted the pottery market once and for all."Yet, as impressive as these machinations sound, the traveling merchant herself seems to almost forget about this. After all, it was nothing more than a small episode amidst her years of conducting business all over the world.

Thus, it is also a kind of "storage" box.However, placing packages into the mailbox may result in damage to said package, so it is not recommended that you do so.

These shrubs are commonly seen within Sumeru City and are dotted with flowers that make its branches look as if countless yellow butterflies are resting upon them. Though it is not a particularly stunning landscape plant, it still possesses a mundane beauty that shows off the spectacle of urban life without stealing the spotlight, especially when compared to brighter flowers. However, for some researchers, these seemingly "complementary" flowers stir up a very different feeling in their hearts...

Desert_Fox_(Furnishing) : Animal Outdoor Creature

A sly animal as elusive as a fairy that often appears in folk stories, symbolizing unusual cunning and ancient memories.These animals call the vast desert home and are smaller than most of their kin, which is possibly how they evaded the ancient calamities. Their long ears are an adaptation that helps them better live in their hot and dry desert home.Logically speaking, you would think that these creatures would be much more active in the cooler Realm Within, but neither the slightly muddled Tubby nor the itinerant Chubby have seen them all that much, and in lieu of hard evidence have had to guess that they likely have a decent relationship with the Masked Weasels, for they can be seen (when the Desert Foxes can be seen at all) playing together.

A metal street light, oft to be found in the city of Mondstadt, upon which hangs a vertical flag.They say that the production of the poles thereof burned through a stockpile of metals built up over many years due to their use of solid metal, and created a lot of business for the blacksmiths.Which was just as well: with the Knights no longer venturing abroad often and the limitations of relying on selling weapons to adventurers for income, the life of a blacksmith can be quite tough.

Unfortunately, these little lights cannot pierce the thick fog of darkness.

If necessary, this Launch Tube can also be used as a flare launcher.

The standard guardrail used by various merchants within the Court of Fontaine. Deceptively weak in appearance but actually quite sturdy, many fit adventurers have tried to knock them down and failed.The base of these guardrails utilizes differential air pressure suction to firmly adhere to clean surfaces. The ropes used are high-strength cables commonly employed by cranes to lift heavy objects. Both were products developed by a Fontaine Research Institute project team in their early years. In order to reduce and share R&D costs, relevant technologies were released to as many clients as possible to maximize the manufacturing volume of the components, including, but not limited to selling the guardrail bases and mounts for table lamps and wall sconces...However, the project team eventually faced financial difficulties, going bankrupt and disbanding anyway. Even after recouping the R&D costs in full, the financial status of several projects was so dire that they were simply beyond saving...

Naturally, even if it should fail to scare them off, you needn't worry, for The Realm Within doesn't seem to have much of a bandit problem anyway...

"These plants can be used to make dyes. If you place them into boiling water and add some spices and Mountain Date Wood chips, you can finish refining them into a vibrant red dye that is most striking indeed."The latest edition of the Matra manual has this to say concerning this species of desert shrub.Usually, Matra will not need to do such things as "dye things on the spot," and so the Matra have speculated that "the General Mahamatra must be telling us to be on our guard against criminals who might use plant dyes to create false traces that could interfere with our investigations."

"Ah, the sun's gone down again. I wonder if I'll be able to sleep well tonight..."As she watched the last moments of evening flee from sight, the sleepless young woman groaned as she continued to sit at her desk, trudging ever forward through her paper until unconsciousness swarmed her...When she finally awoke, a leaf stained color of even-tide was beside her hand, and lo and behold, she had made good progress on her work. It was not until the next time when she went to view the stars in the desert that she would realize what plant that leaf had come from. Then, she would agree that the sight of its long, narrow leaves dancing in the wind was indeed a most memorable sight — certainly one worth leaving a memento of.
