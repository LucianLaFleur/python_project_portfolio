Charcoal-Baked_Ajilenakh_Cake :  A dark-colored pastry. The Ajilenakh Nuts were first roasted and powdered before being sieved, added to a batter, mixed evenly, and then baked. The final product by no means looks impressive, but it exudes the fresh aroma of Ajilenakh Nuts, and it tastes better still with some jam.

Milky_Mushroom_Crisp_Tower :  A crunchy appetizer that's baked with mushrooms and cheese on top of bread slices. A single whiff of its amazing smell is enough to fill one with anticipation. Give it a bite, and you'll experience a pleasant burst of sweetness.
