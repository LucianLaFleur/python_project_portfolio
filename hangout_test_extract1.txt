This is not quite what the plan was, but Noelle is no quitter...
Copying the Cavalry Captain[]

Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 01.ogg Charles: Oh, it's the Honorary Knight and Noelle. Can I get you a drink? ...A non-alcoholic drink, of course.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: No need... We didn't come here to drink...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: I wanted to ask if... um, if there's been anyone... causing any trouble in the tavern lately?
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 02.ogg Charles: Troublemakers? Hmm, let me think... Actually, there was one.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Oh, really?
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 03.ogg Charles: It's that guy drinking at that table over there... Payne. He keeps ordering refills of our strongest drink, Death After Noon.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 04.ogg Charles: Look at how he's wobbling. If he passes out drunk, that could spell trouble.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Yes... that certainly sounds like a lot of trouble... although, that's not quite what I was asking about...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Umm... Is there anything in the tavern that has been... out of the ordinary lately?
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 05.ogg Charles: Out of the ordinary? Hmm, let me think.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 06.ogg Charles: Yes, as a matter of fact, there is. There are still some empty glasses on the tables upstairs that need clearing away. Must have been left there by the customers this morning.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 07.ogg Charles: But I am busy with the accounts at the moment, and if I can't find time to clear the tables before the evening crowd arrives, things could get difficult.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Really? That sounds truly terrible... Maybe I can help?
 Noelle, you're forgetting why we're here...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Oh... Sorry, I couldn't help myself...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Ahem... Mr. Charles, what I was really trying to ask was...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 08.ogg Charles: Oh, I know! You wanted to know if you could help out, right?
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 09.ogg Charles: Surely that would be asking too much... I have yet to thank you properly for helping us move those kegs last time, and here you are offering to help again... I couldn't accept your offer in good conscience...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 10.ogg Charles: Err... that being said... we are quite overwhelmed right now. So if it's all the same to you, Ma'am, would you mind serving the customers for a while?
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Umm... Umm...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: O—Okay then. It seems you are in great need of assistance...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 11.ogg Charles: Oh, thanks a million. I will leave you to serve the customers, then. Start by taking this Death After Noon to Payne, and then maybe you can clear the tables on the second floor?
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 12.ogg Charles: That should put us back on track. Okay, I should get on with the accounts, so for now I will leave the running of the tavern in your capable hands.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Wow... So this is what happens when I try to go with the flow...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: It appears that Captain Kaeya's way with words does not come the most naturally to me...
 I can't say I'm completely surprised...
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: But... But waitressing in the tavern should be a good means of gathering intel, right? It's quite a common motif in the books I've read.
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: I just need to keep my eyes and ears open while I'm helping Charles with the tavern duties.
(Talk to Charles again)
Media:vo noecop002 1909201 charles 13.ogg Charles: Thanks, I'll leave the tavern in your capable hands.
(Serve the Death After Noon to Payne)
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Excuse me, Payne, here is the drink you ordered...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 01.ogg Payne: *hic* Wha— What's that? Put it to one side... I think I need to sober up...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 02.ogg Payne: This drink is strong... *hic* ...I don't feel so good...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Mr. Payne! Are you alright? Do you need to take a rest...?
 This is a tricky situation...
 How are we supposed to get any intel out of this guy?
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Hmm, let me think... If I'm not mistaken, Captain Kaeya would first get his subject drunk before asking them any questions...
 Surely he's too drunk to tell us anything by now...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: This... appears to be true... We must find another approach...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Hmm... Captain Kaeya would probably appear cordial and sincere as a means to convince his subject to lower their guard, would he not?
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: One must start by focusing on the person's individual circumstances and communicate a complete willingness to help, then slowly move the conversation in the desired direction...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Ooh, but how can I offer to help Mr. Payne right here and now...?
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: I've got it! Perhaps the dried fruits that I prepared for my exam could help him to sober up?
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Ahem... Mr. Payne, please eat this... It will make you feel better...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 03.ogg Payne: What's this...? Tastes sweet and sour...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 04.ogg Payne: Whew... I do feel slightly better now...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 05.ogg Payne: Oh, you're... Noelle, isn't it? And next to you is...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: Mr. Payne! Are you feeling any better? Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 06.ogg Payne: Next to you is... Ah, it's the Death After Noon that I ordered! Did you bring this to my table? Thanks, Noelle!
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 07.ogg Payne: Haha... *hic* This drink... is so strong...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Mr. Payne? Mr. Payne!
 Back to drunkenness again...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: How can this be...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: Drinking like this is disastrous for one's health...
 Maybe plying the customers with alcohol isn't the best approach...
 You could just listen in on their conversations instead.
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: Hmm, perhaps... Although, maybe it would be easier if there were a few more customers?
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: ...Oh, Mr. Charles also asked me to clear the tables on the second floor...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: If the second floor is filled with customers, perhaps I will have the opportunity to overhear a thing or two?
(Talk to Payne again)
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 payne 08.ogg Payne: That was a great drink... Same again, please...
(Go to the second floor and clear the tables)
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: It's such a mess... I must clear everything away quickly so that we can serve more customers!
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: So many stains... Once the tables are clear, they will need to be washed with a good detergent...
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: We're almost done! Ah, a clean and tidy environment always brightens my mood!
Media:vo noecop002 1909203 noelle 20.ogg Noelle: Phew, finally, all clear. Let's go check in with Charles.
(Talk to Charles)
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Mr. Charles, everything has been dealt with.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Is there anything else you need help with?
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 01.ogg Charles: Wow, already? Uhh... The customer at the table by the window just ordered a couple of things. Would you mind taking care of them?
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Okay, leave it all to me!
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 02.ogg Charles: Huh, with Noelle here, the tavern feels livelier than ever.
Noelle works busily at the tavern, late into the night...
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Phew... It's not easy working at a tavern.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: But... at least it's over now.
 Well done! Did you manage to gather any intel?
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Well done to you too! ...Oh. Ah... intel...
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: No! I got so caught up with working that I completely forgot we were here to gather intel.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Wh—What should I do? There are hardly any customers left that I could talk to...
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Oh, am I so incapable of handling even a simple task like this...?
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 03.ogg Charles: *sigh* Thanks for all your help today, Noelle!
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 04.ogg Charles:  I've been a bartender here for more than a decade, and I've never seen a happier crowd of drinkers than the ones who were here tonight.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 05.ogg Charles: I can only assume that with you serving the customers, the wine tasted all the sweeter.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: I'm quite sure that can't be true... I didn't do anything particularly special.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 07.ogg Charles: Customers don't come here purely for the drinks. They come for what the drink represents — some time to relax after a long day of work...
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 08.ogg Charles: Often, customers choose this tavern not just for the quality of the drinks we serve, but also for the great atmosphere.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 09.ogg Charles: You may not have brewed the wine, or even mixed the drinks... But for many customers, service with a smile is what makes the difference between a glass of wine and a great night out.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 10.ogg Charles: It seems this tavern could do with more than just a single bartender. What we need is some proper waiting staff to really take care of the customers. Perhaps I could convince the boss to hire a waitress...
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 11.ogg Charles: Anyway, I digress. Thanks again for all your help tonight!
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Wow... I am so glad to know I made everyone so happy...
 It's okay that you didn't collect any intel.
 You are looking after Mondstadt in your own way.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Yes... Even though I failed to imitate Captain Kaeya...
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: It looks like I was still able to help those in need.
 It's the same with an exam. You'll always have strengths and weaknesses.
 It's the same with an exam. Just aim to do well in the things you're good at.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: Yes... I will keep that in mind.
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: Thank you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 12.ogg Charles: Ahem... Heh... Sorry to interrupt, I sense that it's probably not the best moment...
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 13.ogg Charles: However... Could I ask for one last little favor?
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 14.ogg Charles: Drinking to make merry is all well and good, but passing out drunk in my tavern... That's a pain.
 Who needs to be taken home?
 Someone passed out?
Media:vo noecop002 1909205 charles 15.ogg Charles: *sigh* Payne ordered two more Deaths After Noon over the course of the night...

Commissioner Quarrel[]

(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Kaveh, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19058 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: (Ugh, just my luck... Why does this happen to me?)
(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Badawi, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 19058 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: (If only I didn't fall for that scam last time...)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: I've taken a look at your proposal. It's much better than the ones you showed me before, but I'd still like to make some changes...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: ...Come on, not again? Isn't this the sixth proposal I've shown you? What's your issue this time?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 02.ogg Badawi: Hmm... It's a bit hard to put into words, but the design still doesn't look quite right to me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: I have to say, that's a terribly vague and unconvincing explanation. Please enlighten me — what would feel more "right" to you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 03.ogg Badawi: Hmm, for starters, don't you think this roof is jutting out a bit too far from the top? It looks almost like the head of a fungus.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 04.ogg Badawi: This door, too — I don't think it needs to be nearly this large. If you could reduce it to around my height, you could use the leftover materials to construct a few more rooms—
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: I... *deep breath* The roof and the door are the most fundamental parts of a building. If we were to change them, then what would be left of the design!?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Even if the soul of the building won't be lost, all traces of architectural style would be gone. Anyone with the slightest inkling of architectural knowledge would know to leave them alone!
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 05.ogg Badawi: Oh, I understand the principles of what you are saying, of course, but the truth remains that I'm still a bit unhappy with this design as-is. Is there anything else that you can do?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 06.ogg Badawi: Ah, actually, I just got an idea. Can we get rid of all the extraneous sections on the roof, so the whole design will just be one vertical structure, similar to that of a tree trunk?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: ...What!?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 07.ogg Badawi: Don't architects often say that symmetry makes everything more balanced and pleasing to the eye? This way, the proportions will be completely balanced.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: I... I really don't know how you managed to come up with such a ridiculous idea. Wait, don't tell me... Someone hired you specifically to commission me and put me through the wringer? Come to think of it, though, I really don't think I've gotten on anyone's bad side recently...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Anyway, that's it, I will not be working on this commission anymore. Goodbye! Maybe you can find yourself some other genius who'll be able to satisfy your demands.
(−3 Hearts)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905801 badawi 08.ogg Badawi: Hey, young man, please wait!... *sigh*
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Kaveh looks like he's in a bad mood. I should go check up on him.)
(Talk to Badawi again, optional)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905802 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: *sigh*... Were my requests out of line?

Tavern Heart-to-Heart[]

Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Taking this commission was truly the worst decision ever...
 Are you all right?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Hmm? Oh, hey, I wasn't expecting to run into you here.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: Actually, while we're on that, what are you doing here at the tavern? Don't listen to anyone who says that drinking is an elegant pastime. It's no good for your health.
 I followed you here.
 I saw you arguing with someone just now...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Uh... So you saw all that, did you? Ugh, I thought I was in the clear — I made sure to double check that nobody I knew was around...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: Ahem... Anyway, thanks for looking out for me. Honestly, it wasn't that big of a deal. I'm used to it by now.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Stress is just an inescapable part of being a working adult. Boss! I'll have a glass of wine — same as last time.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Do you want something, too? I'll put it on my tab.
 I'll have a glass of juice.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 lambad 01.ogg Lambad: Wine and a glass of juice, coming right up.
Kaveh chugs down his entire glass of wine...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: I know you're already keeping a secret for me, but if you could add this one to the list as well, I'd really appreciate it. Arguing with a client is not a good look for me... If word gets out, other potential clients might be afraid to work with me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: That guy, though... What was he even going on about!? All those ridiculous demands of his... he's just a blabbering fool trying to act like a know-it-all!
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Kaveh seems a lot more honest after he's had some wine...)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: Another glass, please, Boss! I'm not leaving today 'til someone has to carry me out!
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 lambad 02.ogg Lambad: You've got it, sir! Haha. Gotta say though, it almost feels like you're saying that every other day now...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: It really is every other day that you'd run into a client who knows nothing about construction requirements or architectural style. If this was in the past, I'd never have gone through six whole drafts trying to accommodate the client's preferences.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: But perhaps getting "used" to this just means that I've grown "numb" to it. I've worked on so many projects since graduation, and none of them have been approved at the first pass...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: I would spend a lot of time altering my designs, and by the time the clients were finally satisfied, all my passion and enthusiasm would be gone. It feels like I'm straying further and further from my artistic vision with every change I have to make.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: I suppose, though, that just sticking to your guns and completely disregarding other people's feedback would also not be a good thing.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: All of this makes for a real paradox, one that particularly crops up in my work, too. In the end, what is the true meaning of art? Should I see it as a divine gift of inspiration from the gods, or an expression of the light of my own wisdom?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 lambad 03.ogg Lambad: Here's your drink. How are you already spouting nonsense after just one glass? Your tolerance is usually much better than that.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: Boss, what do you think is the meaning of art?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 lambad 04.ogg Lambad: The meaning of art? Really, my friend, who in Sumeru understands art better than you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 lambad 05.ogg Lambad: Anyway, I dunno about art, but I do know that I'm interested in business, and some patrons are waiting to be served. So you'll have to excuse me for now... Just holler if you need anything.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: ...What do you think, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 I honestly have no idea...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 24.ogg Kaveh: No worries. It was just an offhand question.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 25.ogg Kaveh: It's been bothering me for a while. Even when I'm awake, the question haunts me like a bad dream. I still haven't found a good answer to it... or maybe, there was never a correct answer in the first place.
 Art is something that resonates with the masses?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: Yes, art shouldn't be self-indulgent entertainment saved for the elite.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: Let's say that I built a house for someone. If they don't like how it looks, then no matter how brilliant it may appear to me, they won't be happy with it.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 20.ogg Kaveh: The problem is that it can be very difficult to get validated by others. I could compromise my personal standards to accommodate my clients, but often, that'd just mean creating a final product that I would struggle to look at.
 Something that embodies the creator's efforts and dedication?

Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 21.ogg Kaveh: Exactly. So our thoughts on the meaning of art are rather similar.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 22.ogg Kaveh: In Sumeru, and especially Sumeru of the past, the arts are not a popular discussion topic. Trying to talk about the arts is basically the key to killing any conversation.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 23.ogg Kaveh: It's too bad that I'm not in my best form today... Otherwise, we could have talked about this for a little longer.
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Kaveh still looks dejected, and even the wine didn't help his mood. How can I help cheer him up?)
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (Hmm, maybe I should play it safe and just make a simple suggestion...)
 I'll help you convince the client to come to your side. (This dialogue option leads to Searching for the Commissioner.)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 26.ogg Kaveh: Hmm? Ah, thanks for offering, but you've seen how he is... He's not going to listen to anything I say.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 27.ogg Kaveh: He understands nothing about my design, and all the suggestions he made were as if he just wanted to mock me.
 I don't think he was intentionally trying to be difficult.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 28.ogg Kaveh: ...Okay, it is possible that I was just jaded by my frustration.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 29.ogg Kaveh: Well, given I'm already on my sixth draft, I can probably push myself to make a seventh... Let's go have another talk with him. I know where we'd be able to find the guy.
 If you can convince even him to see your point of view...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 30.ogg Kaveh: You mean... If I manage to get him to see things my way, then this project would also gain recognition from many people?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 31.ogg Kaveh: Hmm... you've got a point. Let's hear him out one more time, then.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 32.ogg Kaveh: Time to get going. I know where we'd be able to find the guy.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 33.ogg Kaveh: There's no time to waste... The wine can wait until another time. I'll go take care of the bill.
(Go to Searching for the Commissioner)
 Let's do something else and clear your mind.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 34.ogg Kaveh: Sounds great to me! I don't even want to think about this project anymore. But what should we do? It's probably not a good idea to just drink until I pass out here...
 Why did you decide to become an architect? (This dialogue option leads to A Dear Memento.)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 35.ogg Kaveh: Huh? Where did that come from...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 36.ogg Kaveh: I mean, it's not like it's some kind of secret. You probably already know some bits and pieces of my past.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 37.ogg Kaveh: My mother is also an architect. I've always adored her drawings, and when I was young, I used to sit next to her and watch her bring all kinds of buildings to life on paper. You could say my interest in architecture just naturally grew with time.
 Would she be able to understand how you're feeling right now?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 38.ogg Kaveh: Perhaps. In fact, I have also seen my mother argue with her clients... But she would always quickly find the motivation to return to her work.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 39.ogg Kaveh: Unfortunately, I've barely had any contact with her since she remarried and moved abroad... Even if I wanted to ask her about her ability to stay positive after an argument, it would seem rude to barge into her life again over something as trivial as that.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 40.ogg Kaveh: I did remember something else, though. When my mother left, she only carried some small personal luggage with her. She left most of the belongings in the house to me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 41.ogg Kaveh: At the time she even told me that it would be great if I could learn a few lessons from her life experiences, so my life and career could go a little more smoothly.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 42.ogg Kaveh: I hadn't quite come to grips with my emotions, and didn't really have it in me to go through any sentimental items, so I just packed anything with memories away in a box, and haven't reopened it since.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 43.ogg Kaveh: It's been a really long time... Now that so many years have passed, maybe I have finally developed the maturity I need to face those memories without losing my mind. Yeah... I should dig it out and take a look.
 Um... Do you think I can come with you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 44.ogg Kaveh: Huh? Ah... Sorry, I've had too much to drink and wasn't thinking clearly. You're right... I should do these kinds of things with the support of a friend.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 45.ogg Kaveh: Uh... speaking of that... I can call you a friend now, right...?
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 46.ogg Kaveh: Either way, thanks for reminding me that I can invite you to come along. Had I just gone back by myself, it would have looked like I'm deliberately trying to keep things from you.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 47.ogg Kaveh: Ugh, thinking too hard about the words is giving me a headache, so I'll just give it to you straight. Ahem. Thanks to your advice, I have decided to put my current projects on pause for now, and spend some time trying to rekindle the passion for my craft.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 48.ogg Kaveh: If you want to stick around and see how this will turn out, you'll be sure to encounter some bits and pieces of my past. Do you think you'd find that too boring?
 I don't think so.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 49.ogg Kaveh: Alright, then let's head back together. I mean, you already know where I live...
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 50.ogg Kaveh: Hah, who knew that the day would come when I, too, would have some friends over.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 51.ogg Kaveh: Let me see... I should have tidied up the place before I left the house this morning. Alhaitham shouldn't be home now, either — he's usually in the records room at this time of the day.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 52.ogg Kaveh: Anyway, there's no more time for drinks. I'll go take care of the bill.
(Go to A Dear Memento)
 How about looking into another career? (This dialogue option leads to Educational Organization.)
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 53.ogg Kaveh: A different career... I see, that's not a bad idea.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 54.ogg Kaveh: I think I've heard a saying somewhere before — eighty percent of a working adult's woes are due to not having enough Mora in the bank.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 55.ogg Kaveh: It's just a saying, of course, but even I will admit that my life would be a lot better if I could make additional Mora.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 56.ogg Kaveh: And if I want to make Mora, I should finish that ridiculous commission... But I really can't find it in me to go back and talk to him right now.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 57.ogg Kaveh: Hold on! I just remembered that I used to have a senior classmate by the name of Alkami. If memory serves me right, he's no longer taking private commissions, but he's still doing pretty well for himself.
Media:vo kvcop001 1905803 kaveh 58.ogg Kaveh: Maybe I'll be able to get some advice from him... Yeah, I should get on this right away! No more wine for me today — I'll grab the bill and be on my way.

Field Study[]

Media:vo kvcop001 1907101 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Most materials going from Caravan Ribat to Aaru Village would pass through here.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907101 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: There are a lot of monsters out here today. Let's clear the area. If you find it hard to keep up, just let us know.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907101 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: Oh, don't worry about me, this is nothin'. I'll be careful though, and you should do the same.
(After defeating the enemies)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: Phew... *grimace*...
 Are you hurt?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 02.ogg Badawi: I'm fine. Haha, I've spent my entire life fighting these kinds of monsters in the desert, after all. They won't get the best of me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 03.ogg Badawi: But it's one thing to fight against monsters, and another to fight against an old injury... Ugh, it's something I picked up when I was young. There were many fights between mercenary brigades back then, and one day, someone stabbed me in the back.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 04.ogg Badawi: I didn't think much of it back then, but with age it's caught up to me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 05.ogg Badawi: Few mercenaries get to enjoy their later years. Failing health tends to take the joy out of reputation and wealth, and many mercenaries never even made much of the latter to begin with.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Is there someone you know who can help to look after you?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 06.ogg Badawi: Unfortunately, no. My wife passed away at an early age, and I don't have any children.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 07.ogg Badawi: Sometimes I'd close my eyes, and realize most of my life story has already been written. I have many regrets about my past, but at the same time, I also know that there were never many options for me in the first place.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 08.ogg Badawi: I joined the Eremites when I was young, and won many battles with them. My survival was more a matter of luck than actual ability.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 09.ogg Badawi: If at all possible, I want future children of the desert to have some more options in life. I don't want them to turn out like me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 badawi 10.ogg Badawi: My apologies. The older we get, the more we tend to ramble. Seems like we've already cleared out most of the monsters. Let's hurry over to Aaru Village.
Badawi walks into the distance as he talks. Kaveh is lost in thought as he observes the figure of the elderly man...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: ...
 What's on your mind?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: I think it's really admirable of him to spend his whole life's savings on people he's never met.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Maybe he's doing this out of the kindness of his heart, a kindness that hasn't been eroded away by the struggles of his life.
 Doesn't that also sound like you, Kaveh?
 You're also that kind of person, which is why you're helping him.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: ...Perhaps. To clarify, though, I don't think I'm quite the same...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Some people call me an idealist. Sure, I do have some "idealist" sentiments, such as wanting everyone to be able to lead a happy life.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: But my situation is... more complex than that. In the beginning, what drove me to harbor those thoughts was less "idealism," and more a sense of guilt.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: When I was young, I encouraged my father on a whim to take part in the first Interdarshan Championship hosted by the Akademiya.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: He set off confidently hoping to win something for me, but failed to clinch the title. What's more, he fell into depression after the competition, and requested to join an investigative research project in the desert.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: I never saw him again. Word has it that he got caught in quicksand. Even if other factors may have contributed to his death, the fundamental cause still circles back to me.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: I started doing many things in life because I wanted to make amends. Even in cases where I couldn't do something for a specific person, I still did whatever I could. I think I just wanted... to make myself feel a little better.
 And is that still how you feel?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: At this point, even I don't know.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: I've tried self-reflection, but it didn't help. I can't seem to walk away from many things that I see or hear about, even if they don't directly concern me, and I can't quite pinpoint the source of it.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: Maybe it's just like what those Vahumana scholars often say — it's hard for people to truly understand themselves.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: I could be doing things out of endless guilt, or I could be doing them out of a strong sense of empathy. It could even just be a matter of conceit. The potential motivations could number in the dozens, but the actions they result in are the same.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: Anyway, I suppose I don't really mind being called an idealist. They also used that term to describe my father. It seemed to carry fewer connotations back when he was around.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: I've known Alhaitham for many years now, and discussed my ideology with him for nearly as long. Uh, maybe "argued" is a better word for it...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: He told me a long time ago that no matter how strong of a swimmer you may be, you'll still get dragged under by the others who are drowning once you run out of stamina. He believes this is the fate that awaits all idealists.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: I still believe I should live by my ideals, and I've given him countless reasons why I think it's a good idea to do so. Perhaps my ideals are flawed, but are there really any perfect things in this world?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 20.ogg Kaveh: Unfortunately, he remains unconvinced. His personality is the exact opposite of my own. If someone happens to drown next to him, he'll most likely stand on the shore, and mumble something along the lines of "respecting other people's fates."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 21.ogg Kaveh: But as you can see, I'm not the only idealist in the world. Just as there are different seasons, there are also different people. There are many others who will continue to care about the fates of those who are not directly related to them.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 22.ogg Kaveh: ...And when I finally run out of stamina, someone will also reach out and bring me back to shore...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 23.ogg Kaveh: ...Someone will help me, right? ...Yes, I've already been helped like that before.
 Should I have a life preserver at the ready?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 24.ogg Kaveh: Oh please, it's not like we're actually talking about swimming! ...Also, just so you know, I actually took a swimming elective back in the day. Don't underestimate my skills.
 I'll help you when the time comes.
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 25.ogg Kaveh: Haha, but you've helped me plenty already! If you didn't reach out to me, I would probably be passed out on the tavern table right now instead of talking with Badawi.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 26.ogg Kaveh: Either way, I'm feeling much better than when you first found me at the tavern. I can feel inspiration already welling up inside of me... maybe this will be just the opportunity I needed to create a whole new style!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907103 kaveh 27.ogg Kaveh: Alright, let's head to Aaru Village!

Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Now that we're here, it's my partner's time to shine. Mehrak!
Mehrak: Beep-boop!
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 badawi 01.ogg Badawi: What's this?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: My toolbox. I built it using an ancient mechanical core. It's not too smart, but it's super useful, and can help me with a variety of tasks.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: I'll take Mehrak and find a suitable location for the building. Once that is done, I'll get to work on a few designs...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 setare 01.ogg Setaria: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 Setaria?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: Ah, you know each other?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 setare 02.ogg Setaria: Hello, I suppose you must be Kaveh from Kshahrewar. I've heard of you before. My name is Setaria, and I'm currently the person in charge of promoting educational assistance programs here in the desert.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: Educational assistance programs... Then you must be familiar with the local conditions here.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 setare 03.ogg Setaria: I can't say I'm too familiar just yet, but if you have any questions, I'll try my best to answer them.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: I've been commissioned by Mr. Badawi to build a library in the desert. We've settled on the general design direction, but we are trying to finalize some details based on the conditions around the intended location.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 setare 04.ogg Setaria: A library? Do you intend to open it to the public for free?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 badawi 02.ogg Badawi: That's right. I want to make sure the children will have books to read.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 setare 05.ogg Setaria: That's fantastic, I'm sure the children will be thrilled. Right now, we don't have access to many paper books, or a quiet place to read. Truth be told, this very thing has been keeping me up at night.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Let me get straight to my questions, then. Can you estimate the number of children around here who'd be interested in reading? Besides the usual noise of village pedestrians, are there any other sources of noise in the village?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: Oh, and have any landslides occurred here recently? And also, where are the spots around the village that have been most affected by wind and erosion?
Setaria considers Kaveh's questions and offers her answers...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: ...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: ...
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: ...Alright, that should be everything.
(+1 Heart)
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: Badawi, let's go over the budget again. We'll keep the building structure the same, but make the place a little bigger, so it'll be able to hold more people, and get better natural light.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: The parts of the project that'd cost the most will be the insulation and ventilation materials. I'm sure you understand, no one likes to read in a place that's hot and stuffy.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: I want to make significant changes to the arrangement of the bookshelves, tables and chairs. I'll go over the specifics of that shortly. I have two plans in mind — both are pretty minimalist in style, but will provide a very different ambiance from the world outside.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: Our final cost should be around seventy percent of the last figure I quoted. The whole thing should take around half a year to complete.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: Mehrak has produced a sketch for you all to see. If everyone's okay with it, then we'll proceed with that as the formal plan.
 You've got a new design plan already?
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: The inspiration just came to me naturally, all I did was put the thoughts to paper.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: I must give you credit, though, if it weren't for your advice and suggestions, I probably wouldn't have landed on this new style so quickly.
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: According to the traditions of my profession, I should probably name this style after you. Let's call it the "(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) Style."
Media:vo kvcop001 1907104 kaveh 20.ogg Kaveh: In the meantime, let's look forward to the day when this building is completed and can finally open its doors.
