Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

Aranaga: Brings the flowing, invisible, untouchable... "Hope." A new Ashvattha.
 Hello...
Aranaga: Hello, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Aranaga: You stopped the Marana, and helped the wilting forest to be lush again. Thank you, and... Soft-Fluffy White-Mushroom Floaty.
 See you...
Aranaga: See you, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).

Dialogue Set #2[]

Aranaga: Withered memories, and growing new friends... Like the Yajna Grass, Aranaga thinks.
 About the Yajna Grass...
Aranaga: Already became dust in the wind, the Yajna Grass. Nara probably see it that way.
Aranaga: But... It is radiant again from the forest plants, those already floated away, deeply buried, memories of green leaves with no trace... Every time new Yajna Grass grows new sprouts.
Aranaga: Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) and White Floaty are the same. New friends, also old friends. Because have withered and are reborn.
 About "Mawtiyima"...
Aranaga: Without the infestation of Marana, Mawtiyima will once again cover flowers and trees... after the moon rises and sets.
Aranaga: Aranaga must thank Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) and White Floaty.
 Goodbye.
Aranaga: Bye, new friends.

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
"Aranaga" might be derived from the Nāga, a race of divine half-man, half-serpent beings in Hinduism.
This is based on the interpretation that Aragaru and Aranakin, who are also involved in Agnihotra Sutra, are also named after heavenly beings.
