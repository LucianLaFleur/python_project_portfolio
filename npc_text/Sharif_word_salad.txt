Sharif is Inayah's father and a member of the Sumeru Akademiya and had a shaky relationship with her. During Nilou's Story Quest, he enters the Grand Bazaar to issue a shutdown order on Zubayr Theater due to the theater's constant violation of Akademiya principles. The Traveler, who had attended the celebratory feast on Nilou's invitation, advises and encourages her to debate against him to oppose the ruling.
With both the Traveler and the inhabitants of the Grand Bazaar supporting her, Nilou agrees to debate against him which he accepts, believing that they would not be able to have any sensible logic to use against him, taking Safwan with him as an adjudicator. During the debate, he finds that Nilou is much more prepared than anticipated and eventually gives up when Inayah stands up against him. As a result of the loss, it had caused the Akademiya to lose face and he subsequently convinced his superiors to temporarily suspend him from duty to mitigate the damage dealt. He later returned to the theater to see what made it special, where he had an awkward moment with his daughter before leaving, although it was the start of fixing their relationship.
