Profile[]
Yuan Cheng is the youngest son of the old Mingyun Village mine owner, Yuan Hong. Upon reading their weak father's last will, he and his brothers, Liang and Qing, set off to the mines in search of their father's treasure.
Unfortunately, the brothers misinterpreted their father's words believing that a real treasure exists. Each set-off to a different mine believing they've outsmarted the other and will have their father's entire fortune. However, what Hong wanted for his sons was to be united even after his death as their bond as brothers is a great treasure. If there is any physical treasure, it's the tree they've planted as a family in the past that the Hong was hoping to spend time together with. In one of these mines, Qing was surrounded by monster's and met his end.
