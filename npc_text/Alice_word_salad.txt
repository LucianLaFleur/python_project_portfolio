  Quest-Exclusive NPCs 




Alice is the mother of Klee, a famous adventurer who authored the Teyvat Travel Guide, and the founder of the Hexenzirkel,[6] as well as one of its elders. She is a polymath whose skills include alchemy, astrology, engineering, magic, and medicine.
While Alice has not yet been met in-person, she was directly involved in setting up the Version 1.6 event Midsummer Island Adventure and left a phonograph record with a message from her for the event's attendees to find. She was also involved in sending the party to the Golden Apple Archipelago again in Version 2.8's event, Summertime Odyssey, although she does not seem to have a hand in the events that occur afterwards.

Profile[]
As well-versed in astrology as she was, my master knew only astrology. Alice, on the other hand, was skilled in a great many other mystical fields.—Mona, A Bewildering Fate
Alice is an adventurer who belongs to a long-lived race and is at least 500 years old herself. She has allegedly seen the entire world and possibly even beyond, based on the description of Wings of Feasting, her reference to the Rubicon,[7] and her narration of Aloy's Collected Miscellany in Dainsleif's place.[8] While it is unclear what Alice does on her adventures besides satisfying her personal curiosity, she comments that "Teyvat's borders have grown fragile these past two years — looks like Mommy's going to have to get busy" as to why she had to quickly leave her family again after delivering the Wings of Feasting.
Alice's immense magical prowess has led Albedo to call her a "near-omnipotent sorceress," while Diluc states that she is the only other person besides Venti, the mortal form of the Anemo Archon Barbatos, who could have arranged the events at the Golden Apple Archipelago during Midsummer Island Adventure.[9] Mona also speaks favorably of Alice's skillset and sought out Alice's successor — Klee — in hopes that their combined knowledge would be enough to read the Traveler's fate, failing to anticipate the possibility that Alice had not passed any of her magical skills on to Klee.[10] She also states that the Narukami Pillars on Yashiori Island, which suppress the Tatarigami and were allegedly created by the Raiden Shogun, were created with techniques that are "quite familiar to [her]."
Alice touts a commendable number of skills and contributions to the world of Teyvat, which includes but is not limited to:

Astrology
Alchemy
Creating puzzles and Hydro Barriers throughout the Golden Apple Archipelago[9]
Explosives-crafting[11]
Creating Dodoco, an explosive doll which she taught Klee how to make[12]
Inventing a phonograph
Inventing the Temari game[8]
Potion-concocting[13]
Testing various scientific endeavors and engineering projects, although most of her known attempts ended in failure[11]
Inventing a long-distance instant communication device

Story[]
History[]
Alice became acquainted with the Khaenri'ahn alchemist Rhinedottir at an unknown point in the past, along with other witches in Hexenzirkel. The two have a close enough bond that Rhinedottir later sent Albedo, her apprentice and creation, to seek Alice out for help with his final assignment. Alice, in turn, brought him to the Knights of Favonius in Mondstadt, believing they had the resources to build a large research lab for him.[15]
Alice became acquainted with Yae Miko at some point, calling the over 500-year-old kitsune a "little girl" and recounts in the Inazuma edition of the Teyvat Travel Guide how easy it was to make Miko cry. Alice also mentions Asase Hibiki as "that killjoy shrine maiden" and Neko as "that fat cat," further indicating that she traveled to Inazuma after the cataclysm 500 years ago.[16]
Sometime after the cataclysm, Alice met the Oceanid Idyia in Sumeru, who had fled Fontaine after the death of the previous Hydro Archon Egeria. Alice granted her wish to be away from everyone else and sent her to the desert with the Veluriyam Mirage domain.
When Hexenzirkel member I. Ivanovna N., also known by the codename "N", was about to get married, Alice and the other Hexenzirkel members sent her an invitation in the form of a riddle to meet with them.
Fifty years ago, Alice made a pact with her friend and rival, Barbeloth, resulting in Alice taking possession of her diary,[17] which Alice in turn eventually left in Klee's care.
At some point in time, Alice met Klee's father, another renowned adventurer, during her travels.[18] They had Klee, and decided to stay in Mondstadt for a while to raise her. Around this time, Albedo sought her out at Rhinedottir's behest, leading Alice to take the boy in and insist on treating each other as a "real family,"[15] further insisting that Albedo refer to her as "mother." Alice also imparted Barbara with the "Idol Magazine," inspiring the young deaconess to become an "idol" for Alice's "Teyvat Idols!" group, although the group never came to fruition due to recruitment troubles.[16][19]
Alice also met Dori at some point and became her first supplier. Dori always speaks highly of her and is surprisingly generous when it comes to sending Mora back to her.[20][21] On the other hand, Alice also values Dori highly, such as when she narrated Dori's Collected Miscellany, and one of her self-proclaimed titles is "Supplier to the Renowned Lord Sangemah Bay."[8][22]
Sometime after Crepus died four years before the game's start, Klee noticed Diluc's disappearance, which prompted Alice to look into the matter. After finding out about Crepus' passing, Alice sent Diluc a lengthy letter to express her condolences and give him words of encouragement.[23] Three years before the game's start, Alice and Klee's father went to travel "somewhere dangerous and far away," and entrusted Klee to Albedo and the Knights of Favonius.[24][25]
Alice began writing the Teyvat Travel Guide in the recent past, documenting notable areas and features in her travels, although its highly personal and subjective writing style makes the work read more like her personal diary rather than an actual travel guide. The Mondstadt and Liyue editions began circulating some time ago, as Jifang of the Wanwen Bookhouse claims the Liyue edition has been out-of-print for some time due to its unpopularity.[26]
The Mondstadt edition was likely written shortly after Alice's arrival in Mondstadt, before raising Klee. During that time, she observed Amber's Baron Bunny and was inspired to build an explosive doll, which eventually became known as Dodoco. She also became known for performing aerobatic stunts after launching herself with an Anemo Slime, only to receive a Gliding Violation from Jean.[27][28]
While writing the Liyue edition, Alice became acquainted with Zhongli, whom she described as "the sternest person" she knows. She also cured Echo of his stutter, but the potion's side-effects cause him to be compelled to perfectly imitate those around him, which he is still afflicted by to this day.[13][29]
While the Inazuma edition was first published during the Irodori Festival, its contents set Alice's experiences as occurring shortly before the outbreak of war a year ago. She attempted to recruit Kamisato Ayaka for "Teyvat Idols!" only to be rebuffed at least six times, and befriended Yoimiya.[16]

Present Day[]
Shortly before the events of Version 1.6, Alice found the Golden Apple Archipelago and thought of Klee. As a gift to her and to the people who were taking care of her, she decided to dress-up the islands, leaving behind various gadgets and games to turn it into a "summer park" for everyone to enjoy. In order to get everyone to come, she concocted a plan of leaving behind threatening letters, encouraging them to go to the island to deal with a fictional enemy, called 'Dodo-King.' However, once the last puzzle was dealt with, the truth was revealed through one of Alice's inventions, which she calls the "Alice Phonograph." She explained herself and the island and that she was already exploring another area in Teyvat.[9]
Sometime later, Alice returned to Mondstadt to visit Klee. During the trip, she ran into Venti and gave him a Dodocommunication Device to give to a friend of his, which he would give to the Traveler. She then took Klee on vacation.
During the Windblume Festival of Version 3.5, Alice responded to the lantern on the Hexenzirkel's Island in the Sky, which was discovered after an investigation by the Traveler and co. when Collei found an old letter the Hexenzirkel had sent to N.
Shortly before the events of Version 3.8, Alice had asked her friend Idyia to orchestrate a summer trip to the Veluriyam Mirage for Klee. Alice sent a letter about the trip to the Knights of Favonius Headquarters along with a magic invite that would teleport Klee and her companions to wherever they desired to go.

Trivia[]
Alice is aware of an otherworldly outlander who was in Teyvat centuries before Aloy's theoretical arrival in Teyvat.[8] As Aloy is a collaboration character and has not been integrated into any of Genshin Impact's story, it is unclear when Aloy's theoretical arrival in Teyvat would occur. Klee is shown in Aloy's Collected Miscellany outside of Aloy's gameplay showcase, but Alice and Klee are of a race "blessed with longevity," making it possible that Klee ages slowly. The outlander Alice is referring to may therefore be:
The Traveler. Although the Traveler came to Teyvat with their sibling, the sibling is revealed to seemingly not share at least some of the Traveler's otherworldly properties.[30]
The Traveler's sibling. Although the sibling came to Teyvat with the Traveler, it is suggested that the sibling has more knowledge about the meaning of their arrival in Teyvat. The sibling's first destination after arriving in Teyvat was Khaenri'ah, which may also have something to do with their lack of otherworldly properties, and they came to Teyvat specifically because "the heavens responded to the summoning."[31] It is therefore possible that the sibling garnered more attention as an otherwordly outlander than the Traveler did.
Another otherworldly outlander.
Alice is familiar with Earth culture, introducing idol culture to Barbara via a magazine and having previously made statements about the Rubicon, with the implied context of the real-life phrase "crossing the Rubicon."[32]
While the Wings of Feasting were developed as part of a collaboration between miHoYo and KFC, and its description is narrated by Alice, the explanation for the Wings' appearance claims they originally had a blue-and-white color scheme which Alice later modified to be red-and-white to fit her family's tastes, rather than innately having KFC's red and white brand colors.
In The Little Witch and the Undying Fire, Alice makes a reference to Murphy's law.
Alice is a strong candidate for one of the Descenders recognized by the Fatui. Along with her knowledge of the world outside Teyvat, she is the only other known character besides the Traveler who is seemingly unaffected by changes to Irminsul. However, it is possible that Alice's Descender-like qualities relate to her job, which allows her to "see this world and everything that lives in it [f]rom a lot of different perspectives" and also grants her "special privileges" which she mentions in the context of Teyvat's "rules" but does not elaborate on.[33]
Later information confirms that not all beings external to Teyvat are considered Descenders, and that Alice is not one of the four known Descenders.[34]
Alice and her daughter, Klee, are of a race blessed with longevity[9] and have pointed, elf-like ears. However, the name of their race and whether or not Teyvat has a name for their race is currently unknown.
During The Final Riddle: A Secret Uncovered, the Chinese equivalent for Kaeya's comment about how Alice and Klee are "kindred spirits, both wild and free" is 母女俩都是自由自在的精灵 "The mother and daughter both are free and unfettered jīnglíng." 精灵 jīnglíng primarily refers to supernatural entities in a broad sense, such as elves, spirits, and fairies.[35]
In the field of European legends and fantasy, 精灵 jīnglíng mainly refers to elves,[36][37] 灵 líng to spirits,[36] and xiǎoxiānzi (小仙子) to fairies.[36] That said, jīnglíng has previously been used to describe Barbatos before he became Archon, and Paimon. For Barbatos, it was translated as both "elf"[38] and "spirit."[39] For Paimon, it was translated as "elf."[40] In addition, it is used as a part of the Chinese name for the Oceanids (纯水精灵 chúnshuǐ-jīnglíng, "Pure Water Elemental"). Given that none of them bear much resemblance to Klee nor to the typical depiction of an elf, translating the term jīnglíng becomes complicated.
The Japanese version unambiguously uses the term エルフ Erufu, "(European) elves" in its equivalent sentence; meanwhile, the Korean version phrases the above expression as "정말 자유로운 영혼을 가진," which roughly means "having truly free souls."
Albedo calls Alice "Aunt,"[9] although not in the familial sense of the word. In Chinese, he addresses her as 阿姨 āyí, a term which literally means "aunt" but is also used as an honorific for older women who have no blood relation to the speaker.
Alice wrote Vol. 1 of The Little Witch and the Undying Fire.
Alice is mentioned in the descriptions of the following 6 Furnishings: "The Adventurer's Burdens" "Witch's Chorus" Dodoco's Beach Nap Dodoco's Summertime Dodoco's Travel Bag Plain Vase: Bronze
Etymology[]
In the Chinese and Japanese versions, the Narukami-style rendering (Japanese-inspired name) of Eris, a historical figure in Enkanomiya, is recorded by the Chinese characters 有栖 Arisu.[41] Historically, they were used as a part of the family name Arisugawa-no-Miya, a branch of the Imperial Family of Japan; meanwhile, in popular culture, they are commonly used as a kanji transcription of the English name Alice. However, there has not any other connection made between Eris (Arisu/Alice) and the adventurer Alice.
Eris is probably named after the goddess of the same name in the Greek mythology (meaning "Strife"), known for having tossed the Golden Apple of Discord into the feast of gods, which eventually caused the Trojan War. During Midsummer Island Adventure, Alice dubs the Haar Islands the "Golden Apple Archipelago," which is what the archipelago is known by in-game.
