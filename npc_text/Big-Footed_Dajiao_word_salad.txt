Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Big-Footed Dajiao: Oh, I'm Big-Footed Dajiao. Just here to take care of a few things. You? *sigh*
 About Rex Lapis' death...
Big-Footed Dajiao: Rex Lapis' Death? I refuse to believe it.
Big-Footed Dajiao: Rex Lapis has lived for more than a millennium, what would bring someone to do such a thing in this day and age?
Big-Footed Dajiao: If you ask me, the Qixing are up to something.
Big-Footed Dajiao: No wonder the staff at the ministry are so uptight, they must be feeling uneasy.
Big-Footed Dajiao: Look at me, just rattling off whatever comes to mind. I'm just mindlessly blabbering. Don't go repeating anything to the Millelith, okay?
 What're you taking care of?
Big-Footed Dajiao: I carry bridal sedan chairs, and I've just been contracted to carry a new one, but I wanna get a sign for it so the Millelith won't stop us...
Big-Footed Dajiao: But as soon as I started to speak, I had this certification form thrown at me. I already got certified ages ago, I came here to get a sign...
Big-Footed Dajiao: She didn't listen to me at all... *sigh*
 See you.
Big-Footed Dajiao: Hey, excuse me. I was here first, please don't try to cut in line.

Nighttime[]

Big-Footed Dajiao: I think I ate too much, my wallet's been cleaned out again... *sigh*
 What'd you eat?
Big-Footed Dajiao: Tiger Fish and Zhongyuan Chop Suey, don't remember exactly how much I ate...
Big-Footed Dajiao: Once I start, there's no stopping me. Work hard, eat hard, right? I got a big appetite.
Big-Footed Dajiao: Oh yeah, did you know? Tiger fish actually used to be called something similar, but the sound changed over time... A bride I was carrying once told me.
Big-Footed Dajiao: Ah, what was it again...?
Big-Footed Dajiao: ...Darn, it's on the tip of my tongue...
 Nice meeting you.
Big-Footed Dajiao: You too. Don't go starving yourself, okay!
