Dialogue[]

(Before completing Transient Dreams)
Hasegawa: An outlander out on the road. What a rare sight nowadays.
 About the Almighty Shogun...
Hasegawa: As a local of Inazuma, I'm a faithful follower of the Almighty Shogun, just like everybody else.
Hasegawa: However, the Almighty Shogun's recent policy has been pretty harsh...
 You mean the Sakoku Decree?
Hasegawa: Exactly! After the ban of foreign cargo ships, many imported high-end goods have become a thing of the past.
Hasegawa: I haven't been able to taste the Dandelion Wine from Mondstadt. And it has been a long time since I got any custom-made silks from Liyue, either...
Hasegawa: If I can't buy anything, what use do I have for this much money? Don't you agree?
 It seems like you are very knowledgeable.
Hasegawa: Heh, with my family background, traveling abroad was a simple matter.
Hasegawa: I used to travel a lot, so I've naturally seen many things. But now...
Hasegawa: *sigh* I feel nostalgia when I reminisce about my past adventures... I guess I'll share those experiences with you.

 You mean the Vision Hunt Decree?
Hasegawa: The Vision Hunt Decree... Well, that doesn't really bother me anyway.
Hasegawa: After all, there aren't that many people with Visions. It's not affecting me much.
Hasegawa: As for how they'll go on after losing their Visions... Well, I'm not sure. Does it have anything to do with me, though?
 Goodbye.
Hasegawa: Goodbye. I hope everything will get better.
(After completing Transient Dreams)
Hasegawa: Hello there. Are you a tourist, here to see the sights in Inazuma City?
 Tell me about the Almighty Shogun...
Hasegawa: As a local of Inazuma, I'm a faithful follower of the Almighty Shogun, just like everybody else.
Hasegawa: Thanks to her enlightened actions, our lives have been much happier of late.
 You mean the abolition of the Sakoku Decree?
Hasegawa: Exactly! While it was still in force, foreign cargo ships were banned and many imported high-end goods became things of the past.
Hasegawa: But now... now, I can taste Mondstadt's Dandelion Wine, and I can order custom-made silks from Liyue...
Hasegawa: Now that's the good life, wouldn't you say?
 It seems like you know a lot.
Hasegawa: Heh, with my family background, traveling abroad was a simple matter.
Hasegawa: I traveled a lot, so I've seen a great number of things. If you don't mind, I don't mind sharing them with you.

 You mean the abolition of the Vision Hunt Decree?
Hasegawa: The Vision Hunt Decree... Well, that didn't really bother me anyway.
Hasegawa: After all, there aren't that many people with Visions, so it really didn't affect me.
Hasegawa: As for the things they experienced while dispossessed of their Visions... Well, I'm not sure. Does it have anything to do with me, though?
 See you.
Hasegawa: See you. Things will get better still, you'll see!
