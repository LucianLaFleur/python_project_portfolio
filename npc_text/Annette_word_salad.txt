Annette: The clues for Fecund Hampers are on this noticeboard. You should be able to work the clues out quite easily if you have some knowledge of Mondstadt customs.
Annette: The Church of Favonius is in charge of helping the residents place the gifts and post the clues on the board every year.
Annette: There are many people preparing gifts this year, and the clues on the board will be updated regularly, so come and have a look when you have time.
