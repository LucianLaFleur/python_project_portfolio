Misato is offhandedly mentioned by Hanachirusato, who was born out of the filth containing the Kitsune Saiguu's memories. Because the Kitsune Saiguu died during the cataclysm 500 years ago, Hanachirusato's knowledge of the present day is not yet up-to-date at the time she meets the Traveler and Paimon, and she is prone to forget that times have changed.
During the World Quest Sacrificial Offering in Series Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual, if players choose a certain dialogue option referring to "Miss Inagi," Hanachirusato asks if this Inagi's name was Misato. After Paimon replies that her name is Hotomi, Hanachirusato remembers that there is no way Misato can still be alive.
Later, Hanachirusato mentions the fact that Misato's lineage is still going as one of the things which relieves her about Inazuma's present state.[1]
