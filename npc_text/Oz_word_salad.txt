Ozvaldo Hrafnavins,[Note 1] typically shortened to Oz, is Fischl's night raven familiar and companion. Rather unusually, he is capable of speech; currently, the only other known familiars like him are Baizhu's Changsheng and the Traveler's Paimon.
He is summoned into battle through Fischl's Elemental Skill, Nightrider, and Elemental Burst, Midnight Phantasmagoria.

Profile[]
On Fischl's fourteenth birthday, her peers refused to accommodate her role-playing antics and mocked her for it. She sought comfort from her parents, only to meet similar rejection, just as the "Princess Fischl" in her favorite novel did. Torn apart by her parents' words, she hid herself in the library to cry. It was there that she felt the sensation of being watched, and when she looked up, she saw the night raven before her, along with a Vision — as if reenacting the events of her novels in reality.[4]
According to Oz, Fischl created him and gave him his powers, so he is ostensibly a subconscious manifestation of her Vision's power.[5] Oz also shares a soul and fate with Fischl.

Appearance[]
Oz has the appearance of a purple raven, with gray/white eyes and a prominent crest, who is capable of summoning Electro energy. He has a similar appearance to depictions of Kapatcir, the long deceased Thunderbird of Tsurumi Island, though naturally far smaller in size.

Powers and Abilities[]
When summoned into battle, Oz fires bolts of Electro energy at Fischl's opponents. Fischl is also capable of temporarily taking his form, during which she can see through his eyes and fly. She typically uses this ability to survey the surrounding area or to quickly move around in battle.
Oz is apparently capable of traveling long distances without Fischl as well; according to Fischl, he crossed the ocean and brought Sakura Blooms back from Inazuma for her.[6]

Trivia[]
In their voice-overs, the Traveler jokingly suggests asking Fischl if they can swap Paimon for Oz, citing his politeness, use as a translator, and fighting skills. Paimon is understandably upset at this suggestion.
Oz seems to assist Fischl in the same way Paimon assists the Traveler. Even during conversations, he tends to appear and disappear next to Fischl in a burst of Electro and feathers, similar to how Paimon appears and disappears next to the Traveler in a trail of stars.
Mostly due to the way she acts, Fischl has very few friends; according to her Character Stories, Oz is her first true friend. The others are Bennett ("Adventurer Who Bears the World's Curses"), the Traveler ("Visitor From Outer Worlds"), and Paimon ("Strange Fae-shaped Emergency Sustenance").
Oz is mentioned in the description of the following Furnishing: Crow
Etymology[]
The "Hrafna" part of Oz's name translates from Old Norse to "Raven."
Oz refers to Fischl as "Mein Fräulein," which roughly translates to "my lady." The use of this phrase in this capacity is rather archaic and was reserved to address an unmarried noblewoman.
Notes[]

↑ 1.0 1.1 Oz's name has been inconsistent throughout the game, with Fischl's lore and the event quest Immernachtreich Apokalypse depicting it as Ozvaldo Hrafnavins; Fischl's English voiceovers depicting it as Ozvaldo von Hrafnavins; the Chinese version of the game and the event quest What the Skies Conceal, the Water Reveals depicting it as Ozvaldo Hrafnavines; and Ein Immernachtstraum depicting it as Osvaldo Hrafnavins. For this article, Ozvaldo Hrafnavins will be used.
