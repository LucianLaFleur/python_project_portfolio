Profile[]
Though Taroumaru has no extensive dialogue, aspects of his personality can still be deduced from those around him who can attest to his behavior.
Under the ownership of Taroumaru, Komore Teahouse is a successful and well-revered establishment, as evident by Snezhnayan merchant Ramsay finding the tea and atmosphere agreeable. Kozue, an employee at the teahouse, claims that all the staff including her have signed a contract with Taroumaru agreeing to work at the establishment for eternity.
As a former member of the Shuumatsuban, Taroumaru has history with Nakanishi, a retired ninja residing in Komore Teahouse. Nakanishi details how Taroumaru is an old friend of his, having followed him around during his days with the Shuumatsuban. He attests that he and Taroumaru served the Shuumatsuban and the Yashiro Commission with utmost loyalty before their retirement.[1]
Taroumaru is also considerate and intelligent as a former Shuumatsuban member, as Gorou is able to translate his barks with relative accuracy, seeing Thoma as a good friend but worrying about his well-being. When Treasure Hoarders broke into the teahouse, he refrained from fighting as he knew that he was outnumbered; due to this, they also talked in front of him about their plans, having perceived him as no threat; however, due to his inability to speak the human tongue, he could not tell anyone about what he had seen and heard until meeting Gorou.[2]
During the Irodori Festival, Taroumaru participated in the event Clash of Lone Blades hosted by Yasuhiko Tarou. Apparently, Taroumaru was the mightiest warrior among all of the participants.

Appearance[]
Taroumaru's coat is primarily light orange with an off-white color around his belly, paws, eyebrows, and muzzle (indicative of him being a red shiba inu). He wears a white headband tied below his left ear in a bow. Taroumaru wears a brown chef's jacket over a white undershirt tied together with a bow at his chest.
Taroumaru, Inu Shoushou, and Kageroumaru are the only shiba inus in-game that do not use the standard shiba model.

"Thoma, stop hiding around here, you're in my way! *woof*"(Traveler): Huh, that makes sense.Paimon: Or... "Kozue, you're bound to me for the rest of your life, unless our contract is terminated! *woof* *woof*"(Traveler): You didn't believe Kozue when she said she'd signed a secret contract forcing her to work part-time at the Teahouse, did you?Paimon: Oh! Paimon just thought of another one. This one's quite good—Paimon: "Just look at this visitor! Paimon, is it? Look at how cute and clever she is.

Do you remember Taroumaru?Paimon: Yup, it's the owner of the Komore Teahouse, right? A lot of the clients go to the Teahouse to play with him rather than drink tea.(Traveler): So I was thinking, if you were running the shop, you'd definitely be more popular than Taroumaru.Paimon: Hee-hee, of course...

Trivia[]
Taroumaru is mentioned in the descriptions of the following 2 Furnishings: Maple Wood Ritual Drum: Festive Music Teahouse Counter: "Toshimaru"
In Inazuma Reputation Request Kozue's Ironwork, Kozue reveals that Taroumaru will sometimes request Iron Chunks for the Teahouse. She states that she does not know what they are for and does not feel it is her place to ask.
A precious chest containing 180,000 Mora, Raw Meat and Onikabuto can be found behind the kitchen of Komore Teahouse. These items are implied to belong to Taroumaru.
Paimon's dialogue when opening the chest is as follows:
Paimon: Huh? Raw Meat and Onikabuto... is this someone's private larder?
Opening Taroumaru's chest does not count towards the Lightning-Riding Adventurer (I) achievement.
Taroumaru's title during the Clash of Lone Blades event, "Deposit Stolen, Teahouse Boss Enraged", is a nod to this.
Taroumaru is theorized by fans to be the mythical "Majestic Shiba Warrior" who fought along the Great Mujina Youkai. This is mentioned in Yoimiya's Story Quest and profile. The evidence for this theory is as follows:
A shiba warrior briefly appears along Ioroi and a kistune fighting along the Raiden Shogun in her trailer, bearing resemblance to Taroumaru.
Taroumaru is a former member of the Shuumatsuban, implying he has extensive combat knowledge.
Nakanishi's recounting of his and Taroumaru's past confirms that Taroumaru was by his side from his youth to his retirement. As Nakanishi uses an elderly NPC model, this would make Taroumaru considerably older than a shiba inu's average 15-year lifespan.
Taroumaru requires all Komore Teahouse's staff to sign a contract agreeing to work at the establishment forever. However, given that the lifespan of a shiba inu is considerably shorter than a humans, this does not make sense, implying Taroumaru actually intends to work at Komore Teahouse forever.
Thoma mentions Taroumaru in his Hangout Event when talking to Inu Shoushou.
His dialogue is as follows:
Thoma: Here doggy, look — no more danger.
 Thoma: You've gotta wanna eat a little something now? Come on, eat up, then let's get you back to Komore Teahouse.
 Thoma: Whatever's on your mind, you can tell me and Taroumaru all about it.
