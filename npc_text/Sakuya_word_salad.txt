Sakuya's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Sakuya is a gardener and florist who owns and runs a flower shop called "Sakura's Flowers." The shop used to be located in Inazuma City, but is now located by her flower field. She is skilled in the art of ikebana — the act of carefully cutting and processing plants, and arranging them neatly and according to their environment. She learned the craft together with Fushizome under their Ikebana master.[2]
During events, such as the Irodori Festival, Sakuya provides the flowers used in events pertaining to floral arts such as ikebana. She did not, however, participate in the Ikebana event because of the crowd.

Appearance[]
Sakuya is adult female with fair skin and brown eyes. Her golden-brown hair is neatly styled into a bun, with a pink flower-shaped hair clip on the left. She wears an Inazuman-style garb that is primarily blue-gray with a white flower print, black and white socks, and red-soled sandals.

Dialogue[]

Sakuya: Hello there! How would you like to grow some flowers of your very own?
 About the flowers...
(If there are Dreambloom seeds available to claim)

Sakuya: Would you like to have some fun with growing flowers and ikebana? Sure.
(Opens the Dreambloom exchange menu)
(If Dreambloom seeds are already claimed)

Sakuya: You might want to plant the seeds that you already have first. Everything in its good time, as they say.
(If the exchange period for Dreambloom seeds has already ended)

Sakuya: My apologies, but this iteration of Dreams of Bloom has ended. I need to tend to my business in the flower field now.
Sakuya: Swing by and have some fun the next time I organize similar events.
 So, tell me about ikebana...
Sakuya: Ikebana is very important to Inazuma.
Sakuya: In simple terms, you can consider ikebana the act of carefully cutting and processing flowers and other plants before arranging them in a suitable fashion...
Sakuya: In specific, however, you need to take care to grasp the current state of the plants and trim the less presentable parts of them away...
Sakuya: Moreover, your arrangement and placement must be suited to their environment, even down to the angle at which the flowers extend outward...
Sakuya: These details must be given fastidious consideration, and can be a cumbersome process indeed.
Sakuya: Even for someone who loves ikebana like me, it is a most tiring job...
 Goodbye.
Sakuya: Mm, see you.
