Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing Masquerade of the Guilty)
Luzerne: Welcome to the Opera Epiclese, a sanctum for the richest of experiences.
 The "richest of experiences"?
Luzerne: The insipid, the absurd, the shocking and the sorrowful... So long as you visit enough times, you will be able to experience all this at the Opera Epiclese.
Luzerne: Some people enjoy watching the emotions involved in real cases, while others prefer the interpretations and hype involved in theater productions.
Luzerne: Focalors, the Hydro Archon, recognizes them both as things that may be performed at the opera house.
 A "sanctum"?
Luzerne: The Opera Epiclese was founded by the Hydro Archon — the Lady Furina of which we speak.
Luzerne: And should not a place built by a god be named a sacred place? A sanctum?
 See you.
Luzerne: See you.

(After completing Masquerade of the Guilty)‍[verification needed]
Luzerne: Welcome to the Opera Epiclese, a sanctum for the richest of experiences.
 The "richest of experiences"?
Luzerne: The Opera Epiclese is home to both performances and the court trials. The founder of the opera house, Focalors, recognizes them both as things that may be performed at the opera house.
Luzerne: The insipid, the absurd, the shocking and the sorrowful... So long as you visit enough times, you will be able to experience all this at the Opera Epiclese.
Luzerne: Some people enjoy watching the emotions involved in real cases, while others prefer the interpretations and hype involved in theater productions.
Luzerne: But when judgement has been passed and the curtain has fallen, it is time to return to reality and form an objective view of what has transpired.
 A "sanctum"?
Luzerne: The Opera Epiclese was founded by the Hydro Archon — Lady Furina of which we speak.
Luzerne: And should not a place built by a god be named a sacred place? A sanctum?
Luzerne: As Lady Furina gave all of her power to grant Fontaine the energy it needed, we must remember her sacrifice.
 See you.
Luzerne: See you.
