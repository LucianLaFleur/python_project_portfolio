Media:VO Kamla All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Kamla: (I really want to yell out at the sea at the top of my lungs... Would people look at me funny for that?)

Dialogue[]

Kamla: A look at the sea puts the mind at ease.
 Hello.
Kamla: Hello, friend. Well, isn't the sea beautiful?
Kamla: Do not rush your pace. Slow down and appreciate the beauty in life.
Kamla: I've been watching the waves crashing since my husband sailed out.
Kamla: Well, except during storms, of course.
 About your husband...
Kamla: Oh, that bastard... Well... honestly, I don't know where he's sailing right now.
Kamla: Judging by what he'd sent home, he should be safe and well, and he's been to a lot of places.
Kamla: I've got clocks from Fontaine, porcelain bowls from Liyue, dried petals from Mondstadt...
Kamla: I didn't know he could be romantic.
Kamla: But things like these can only be placed indoors. I prefer the fresh air and sea waves outside.
 See you.
Kamla: Goodbye. Enjoy the sea wind.
