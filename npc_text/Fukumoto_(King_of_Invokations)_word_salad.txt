Profile[]
Fukumoto is an author who writes the light novel series King of Invokations. Originally from Inazuma, he was asked by Yae Publishing House to write the book in order to promote the upcoming card game from Sumeru, Genius Invokation TCG. However, he found writing it difficult due to the rules of the game not being finalized yet.
After the first book sold well, he was asked to come to Sumeru in order to meet the team behind the development of Genius Invokation TCG. They were still working out the rules when he arrived, and settled on the final ruleset while he was working on the book's sequel. He also had the illustrator Asagiri create illustrations for the novel, and asked the Traveler to model for him.[1]
While working on the third book in the series, he asked the Traveler to help him find Cyno so that he could use him as a model. Previously, the Genius Invokation TCG researchers had promised to introduce him to Tighnari and Cyno, but they were too busy to find the time. Fukumoto and the Traveler found him in Puspa Café where Fukumoto was able to take several pictures of him, though Cyno insisted on playing a TCG match with him afterwards.[2]
