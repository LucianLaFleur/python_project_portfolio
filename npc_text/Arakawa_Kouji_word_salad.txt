Arakawa is an oni who eventually died and his memories were accumulated in the Sacred Sakura. After the rifthounds damaged the tree's roots, memories such as Arakawa's eventually coalesced into a spirit. One of these youkai spirits, a Daiyouko named Urakusai, possessed the human Tomoyuki to help him write a best-selling novel called A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits, in which he intentionally left behind a ritual that would call forth youkai spirits that would help their summoners.
The Katou brothers, wishing to create a dojo of their own, performed the ritual and summoned Arakawa, who possessed Katou Shingo. Arakawa helped Shingo defeat Domon's best disciple, but when Konda Densuke served him fried tofu, Arakawa instinctively gagged and left to meditate underneath a waterfall near Konda Village to improve Shingo's manliness. Yae Miko and the Traveler, who had been informed by Shingo's brother Youhei, found him and threw salt, forcing Arakawa's spirit out. Since Youhei had also summoned Arakawa, he was about to possess him, but he fainted. Taking notice of the Traveler, he then challenged them to a duel and was bested. Content with the battle, he passed on peacefully.

Appearance[]
From the memories that he was formed from, he took on the appearance of a Kairagi.
