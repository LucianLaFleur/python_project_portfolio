Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available after completing A Wangshan Walk to Remember.


Wen the Fourth: Sigh... To think that after a thousand years of heritage, the Guhua Clan's head doorkeeper must cheat others to survive... What shall we do, what can be done...
Huang the Third: Ugh... Alright, come on now. Am I not sparing my junior from starving to death while guarding our gates...?
Huang the Third: And don't look at me like that. You're always depressed... But you were pleased to see (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)'s performance just now, weren't you?
Wen the Fourth: That fool from before? They get to take a look around in exchange for making you a meal? And I should be pleased about that? Were I a few years younger, I would slay you in one smack...
Huang the Third: Heh! Your technique was inferior to mine just a few years ago!
Huang the Third: ...Anyway, listen... Only a few of us geezers are left. What do you plan to do after we stop testing those who may be destined to join us? Take those books with us to our graves?
Wen the Fourth: ...
Huang the Third: Hah... Just forget it. What's the point of saying such depressing things?
Huang the Third: Oh, why don't you try the food those kids made me? Hehe! I think it's better than Wanmin Restaurant's fare! Here, take a bite! Just a bite!

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Shrouded Vale, Hidden Hero.


Wakamatsu: Please, Master! Take me in as your disciple!
Wen the Fourth: As long as you ensure that you will practice more...
Wakamatsu: Rest assured, I will!
Wakamatsu: Holding buckets with my arms outstretched, holding a low stance under a waterfall... I'll do them all!
Wen the Fourth: Young man, such martial arts training methods don't exist.
Wakamatsu: Haha. Once I learn this stuff, it's time to show them what for, eh?
Wen the Fourth: *sigh* Young man, are you listening to me?
Wen the Fourth: You need to start from the fundamentals, like that non-initiated disciple at the practice all. Start with the wooden stakes as your foe...
