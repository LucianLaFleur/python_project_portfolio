When the Melusines were discovered by Neuvillette, he brought them into Fontainian society. As Neuvillette had just taken his post as the Iudex and the Melusines had just been introduced to society, many people feared them, believing them to be creatures of calamity. Carole worked alongside the then-captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, Vautrin, in order to foster goodwill and cooperation. After five years of work, both she and Vautrin were awarded Medals of Peace by Neuvillette. However, many in Fontaine remained distrustful of Neuvillette and the Melusines, mocking Carole and her dream of having both species peacefully coexist. Eventually, a group of hardliners opposed to Neuvillette decided to frame Carole for a crime she did not commit to teach him a lesson for upstaging the old regime.[2]
The hardliners, including Thibert and Suavegothe, successfully lured Carole to the crime scene and accused her of murder, inciting a crowd of people into ordering her detention. The Gardes were unsuccessful at keeping the mob at bay, resulting in a clash between both sides. To prove her innocence, Carole sacrificed herself to the crowd. Her death led to Vautrin seeking revenge on the hardliners, and his subsequent imprisonment in the Fortress of Meropide.[3]
Around 400 year later, the Melusine Kiara would have a similar incident where someone threatened her, prompting Neuvillette to personally investigate to ensure the incident would not happen again. Kiara, who was kept inside the Palais Mermonia for her own safety, had a dream where she encountered Carole, who remarked that she was delighted to see their dreams become true.[3]
The emblem worn on the hats of the Gardes was redesigned after Carole's death to include a Melusine in commemoration of her.[2]
