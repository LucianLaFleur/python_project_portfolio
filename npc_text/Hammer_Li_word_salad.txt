Dialogue[]

Hammer Li: Hello, do you need something?
 You are...?
Hammer Li: ...Me? You asking who I am? I'm just a strong pair of arms. The name's Hammer Li.
Hammer Li: I picked that nickname myself. Apparently all I'm good for is bashing my hammer all day long.
Hammer Li: *sigh* I wish one day the gods will smile on me and give me a Vision...
 Tell me about your work.
Hammer Li: My work? It's not bad. Not much to say: I hammer this, I hammer that, occasionally that old fart Manager Xiao gives me an earful...
Hammer Li: Anyway, I'm not getting any younger, and this job ain't gonna help me start a family, or buy a boat or house of my own, no matter how long I do it for. So I don't have any big hopes in the future.
 Vision?
Hammer Li: What about them? You're interested in them too?
Hammer Li: I've heard as long as you want something badly enough, a Vision will appear right beside you, ready to do your bidding.
Hammer Li: Wouldn't that be incredible? As for me... I just want a Vision, plain and simple. I've dreamed of having one since I was a little boy, but so far I've had no luck.
Hammer Li: If I had a Vision, I could be like those legendary martial nomads who command the wind and rain and cast lighting.
Hammer Li: *sigh* Where are you, my Vision? I've waited my whole youth for you...
 So, about Rex Lapis...
(After completing Rite of Descension)
Hammer Li: What is there to be said? I was there at the Rite of Descension too. That scared the wits out of me...
Hammer Li: I honestly thought that is was over for us, that the sky was going to to fall over our heads.
Hammer Li: But watching everyone go about their daily lives and have hope for the future anyway... I feel like I should reflect a little myself.
Hammer Li: If you look at things optimistically, Rex Lapis couldn't really have left us, wouldn't you say?
 Goodbye. Chin up.
Hammer Li: *sigh* Thank you... Goodbye.

Hammer Li: Festivals, eh? Well, it's nice and all. The lights are pretty, and things are livelier than usual.
Hammer Li: But you know, it's not like it's got all that much to do with me...
