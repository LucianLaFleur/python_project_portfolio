Dialogue[]

Zinat: This subject is better discussed with colleagues in Kshahrewar.
 Abut your subject...
Zinat: I can't divulge the specifics, but it's a viability study for outfitting constructs with a Vision.
Zinat: I'm a Spantamad researcher specializing in the flow of elemental energy. I don't know enough about empowering constructs, so I'll need help.
Zinat: That's how academic research works. It's not something one can just power through alone.
Zinat: Few can be like Rifaet, who can do research alone and produce lots of results on top of that. Sometimes, it's necessary to work together.
 See you.
Zinat: See you.
