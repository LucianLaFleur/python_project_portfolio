Dialogue[]
During Equilibrium[]

Baixiao: Welcome, is there anything I can do for you?
 Hello.
Baixiao: Welcome, I am Lady Ningguang's secretary. You can call me Baixiao.
 What can you tell me about the Jade Chamber?
Baixiao: The Jade Chamber is where Lady Ningguang holds court. Here, she gathers information and makes important decisions.
Baixiao: From here, there is no matter in Liyue, great or small, that she cannot oversee. Nor can any rumor escape our ears or eyes.
Baixiao: Forgive me for being unable to say more.
 What about Ningguang?
Baixiao: Lady Ningguang is one of the Liyue Qixing. She oversees all of Liyue and its trade.
Baixiao: You must forgive me for not being able to say more.
 I have the utmost respect for Lady Ningguang.
Baixiao: Hmm... You are, indeed, a rare and honest sort — cut from a different cloth from those honey-tongued merchants, greedy for the smallest scrap of information.
Baixiao: The path to riches is actually quite simple. I've spent a lot of time by Lady Ningguang's side, and learned some... secrets, here and there.
Baixiao: How about this: Here are some nuggets of wisdom on the subject of "gold." It's my own personal guidance rather than Lady Ningguang's per se, but maybe it will still be able to bring fortune and prosperity your way.
(Obtain  Guide to Gold ×1)
 See you.
Baixiao: Farewell, and safe travels.

After Where the Heart Finds Rest[]

Baixiao: Hello there, Traveler. How may I help you?
 About the Jade Chamber...
Baixiao: The Jade Chamber is where Lady Ningguang holds court. Here, she gathers information and makes important decisions.
Baixiao: From here, there is no matter in Liyue, great or small, that she cannot oversee. Nor can any rumor escape our ears or eyes.
Baixiao: Of course, we continued working for Lady Ningguang during the period before the Jade Chamber's restoration, just as we always had... But it's good to be back.
Baixiao: Unfortunately, while you are Lady Ningguang's honored guest, we cannot disclose the intelligence gathered here to you. My apologies.
 What can you tell me about Ningguang?
Baixiao: Lady Ningguang is one of the Liyue Qixing. She oversees all of Liyue and its trade.
Baixiao: You must forgive me for not being able to say more.
Baixiao: But considering how well the two of you get along... You might simply be able to ask her if you desire answers.
 I have the utmost respect for Lady Ningguang.

Trivia[]
In Chinese, Baixiao's name translates to "Hundred-Understanding"  (Chinese: 百晓). She shares a similar name with her two fellow secretaries, Baiwen  (Chinese: 百闻 "Hundred-Hearing") and Baishi  (Chinese: 百识 "Hundred-Knowing"). The names may collectively be a reference to Ningguang's renowned insight into the inner workings of Liyue Harbor.[3]
She shares her Korean voice actor with Xianyun.
