Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(After completing The Culling of the Worms: Proposal)
Vinayak: Brave adventurer, are you ready to go collect those components?
 I'm ready.
Vinayak: Excellent! In that case, I leave this matter in your hands.
(Starts the Proposal & Gathering event challenge)
 Not yet.
Vinayak: Alright then. Planning ahead is good for efficiency, after all. But don't end up like Shriya, ever planning but never executing.

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After completing The Culling of the Worms: Introduction)
Vinayak: Brave adventurer, are you ready now?
 I'm ready.
Vinayak: Excellent, excellent! Then let us begin.
(Starts the Introduction & Testing event challenge)
 Not yet.
Vinayak: Alright then. Planning ahead is good for efficiency, after all. But don't spend all your time planning and not executing, like some people.
Shriya: Hey! What's that supposed to mean!? Are you itching for another debate? I'll prove you wrong, I will!

Dialogue Set #3[]

(After completing The Culling of the Worms: Body)
Vinayak: Brave adventurer, are you ready to operate the Wenutslayer Cannon?
 I'm ready.
Vinayak: Alright! Sandstorm's whipping up now. Everyone to your positions!
(Starts the Body & Demonstration event challenge)
 Not yet.
Vinayak: Alright then. Planning ahead is good for efficiency, after all. But don't spend all your time planning and not executing, like some people.
Shriya: Hey! What's that supposed to mean!? Are you itching for another debate? I'll prove you wrong, I will!

Dialogue Set #4[]

(After completing The Culling of the Worms: Conclusion)
Vinayak: If Shriya's hypotheses are correct, this will be the Wenutslayer Cannon's most critical battle. Brave adventurer, are you ready?
 I'm ready.
Vinayak: Alright then, let us begin! Let us prove to all of Sumeru that this cannon isn't just a pretty face!
(Starts the Conclusion & Presentation event challenge)
 Not yet.
Vinayak: Alright then. Planning ahead is good for efficiency, after all...
Shriya: Huh. Is it just me, or has your attitude improved a little?

Dialogue Set #5[]

(After completing The Culling of the Worms: Ending)
Vinayak: ...Well, there are still some affected Wenut nearby. If you've got the time, please help take care of them.
 That's what I'm here for.
Vinayak: Wonderful! Why, this is the best opportunity to test the full output of the Wenutslayer Cannon, if I do say so myself!
(Starts the Completion & Consummation event challenge)
 Maybe next time.
Vinayak: Sure. Just come to me when you have the time.
