Santon's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Santon comes from Fontaine. He claims to be a famous hunter in Fontaine, specializing in animal control (keeping "fierce animals" away from human settlements, for the benefit of the animals as well as the humans). He has recently been hired by the Forest Rangers to drive away several wild animals which have been threatening villages in Sumeru: the Gator Raja, Rishboland Raja, and Sumpter Beastlord. Santon has yet to encounter any of the three creatures, though he has heard many tales about them, which has only increased his wish to see them in person. The Traveler can assist him by finding and driving away the creatures on his behalf.[1]
Santon is a friendly and adventurous person. He greatly values a connection with nature and believes that living in the city causes people to grow weak and complacent. He is thrilled by the natural world because of its dangerous wildlife, which is part of why he enjoys being a hunter, and why he wishes to encounter his quarry firsthand. Santon still shows concern for the people he was hired to protect, and if the Traveler manages to defeat the creatures, Santon will express bitterness at being unable to see them himself, but will be glad that the people of Sumeru are safe, understanding that "stronger predators beat their rivals to the prey."

Appearance[]
Santon wears apparel commonly seen on other characters from Fontaine. He has brown eyes and light brown hair.
