 Darn fish got away again...
Media:VO Sandino 01.ogg "*sigh* Looks like the darn fish got scared away again."

Dialogue[]

Sandino: Looks like I'm not catching anything today either.
 Sorry, I was in a hurry...
Sandino: Huh? Why are you apologizing?
Sandino: Ah, you misunderstand. I'm not blaming you for scaring the fish away, sorry about that.
Sandino: It's my grandchild who's always running around the place — neither fish nor birds will stick around upon seeing him.
Sandino: I'm used to it, though. I love fishing for it requires patience and allows for quiet consideration — the fish not being around is unimportant.
Sandino: Cava's parents don't really accompany him at all, so the fact that he can play by himself is already quite a relief.
 You seem like a patient person.
Sandino: Hehe, with my age, there is nothing I need to do right away.
Sandino: Now, would you like to stay for a meal? Although I didn't catch the fish myself, the taste is guaranteed to be good.

 About the flood...
Sandino: That was almost the worst of disasters that could've befallen a small town like our Poisson... It's a miracle that the town has been restored to such an extent.
Sandino: Seeing Ms. Navia face such an ordeal at her tender age really broke our hearts...
Sandino: She even mentioned preparing compensation. But why would a natural disaster be the Spina di Rosula's fault?
Sandino: I'm ashamed to say that at my age, just keeping myself from being a burden is difficult enough, let alone helping.
Sandino: I have the Spina and Ms. Archenoul to thank. My grandkid and I wouldn't have been so lucky if she hadn't been nearby.
 I shan't bother you further, then.
Sandino: No worries. It's alright. Take care now, the ground's quite slippery.
