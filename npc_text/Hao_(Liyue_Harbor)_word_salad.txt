 Li cuisine...

Dialogue[]

Huihui: Why do you fans of Yue cuisine always have to bad-mouth Li cuisine?
Hao: You Li cuisine lovers started it when you said Yue food is disgusting!
Huihui: But Yue food IS disgusting... You guys practically take raw fish out of the sea and swallow them whole! What you call the "rich aroma of fresh seafood," I call the "pungent odor of dead fish..." There is no flavor profile because it all tastes the same...
Hao: Oh yeah? Well every Li dish is just a plate of Jueyun Chilis that have been buried in salt for half the week! "Rugged essence of the mountains"? More like "essence of mountain lion clawing at back of throat"!
Huihui: How can you say that? You clearly have no taste when it comes to food. All that Yue cooking has completely ruined your palate!
Hao: Hmph, you're clearly only saying that because you've never properly tried Yue food before. I bet you've never BEEN to the Xinyue Kiosk!
Huihui: And I bet YOU have never had proper Li cuisine at Liuli Pavilion!

Event Dialogue[]
Moonlight Merriment[]

Huihui: C'mon, Li Cuisine was clearly the superior tradition this time at Masterful Chefs!
Hao: Oh sure, that sounds like something only Li lovers would say!
Huihui: Well, why don't you just accept that there's nothing redeemable about Yue Cuisine? Did you see that boiled fish dish in the qualifiers? Made that judge's face turn green just from tasting it! You could smell the rank flavor of soil from a mile away...
Hao: W—Well, it's not like Li Cuisine fared any better. I heard that one of the judges failed to show up at the finals because they got a tummy ache from tasting some Li Cuisine during the semi-finals!
Huihui: Nonsense! A tummy ache's got nothing to do with the dish's taste. Li Cuisine is just superior!
Hao: Hmph, you're clearly only saying that because you've never properly tried Yue food before. I bet you've never even BEEN to the Xinyue Kiosk!
Huihui: And I bet YOU have never had proper Li cuisine at Liuli Pavilion!
