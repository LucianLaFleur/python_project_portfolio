Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Jahan: A combination of abundant sunshine, plenty of rain, and the Anahitian Blessing will guarantee a good harvest.
 About Anahitian Blessing...
Jahan: What, you never heard of the Anahitian Blessing?
Jahan: It's practically essential to growing crops, and it's not an overstatement to say it's our savior.
Jahan: Oh wait, I should say the Dendro Archon is our savior, since the Blessing is a gift from her.
Jahan: O Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, O Dendro Archon, may you grant us bountiful harvest!
 See you.
Jahan: I hope everything will be timely.

 Tell me more about the Anahitian Blessing...
Jahan: Hmmm? Have you never heard of the Anahitian Blessing?
Jahan: It's practically essential to growing crops, and it's not an overstatement to say that it's been our savior.
Jahan: Oh wait, I should say that the Dendro Archon is our savior, since the Blessing is her gift to us.
Jahan: Oh great Dendro Archon, may our upcoming harvests be bountiful ones also?
