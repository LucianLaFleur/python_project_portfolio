 I'm gonna get fired...
Media:VO Vuillermoz 01.ogg "I'm definitely gonna get fired..."

Dialogue[]

Vuillermoz: Oh no, oh no, I'm definitely going to get fired...
 Did you cause some kind of disaster?
Vuillermoz: I didn't do anything, but it's just that... I really think they're going to fire me.
Vuillermoz: I've never felt like I truly deserve to be at the Institute. And that feeling is getting stronger.
(After completing Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble)

Vuillermoz: *sigh* I'm no outstanding genius like you, you even earned the title of Honorary Senior Researcher...
 Why are you thinking about that?
Vuillermoz: I used to be part of Mr. Edwin Eastinghouse's Arkhium research team...
Vuillermoz: But I only handled really peripheral jobs. I just took notes and wrote up reports... Worked out statistics, monitored the instruments, that kind of thing...
Vuillermoz: Even then, I didn't understand why all those geniuses would want someone like me working with them. I'm not clever or talented. I'm not even a very good learner.
Vuillermoz: I only escaped the explosion because I couldn't face going to work that day. I called in sick and slept in.
Vuillermoz: I never imagined I'd wake up to find out my research group was almost wiped out in a huge explosion...
 So what are you in charge of now?
Vuillermoz: Me? Nothing. Mr. Raimondo asked me to help supervise the reconstruction work, but... Well, I'm completely clueless about that kind of thing.
Vuillermoz: And when Mr. Raimondo realizes how useless I am he's bound to fire me.
Vuillermoz: *Sigh* Maybe I should just quit and go and find a more suitable job...
 See you.
Vuillermoz: See you.
Vuillermoz: *sigh* I wonder what kind of work I'm suited for...
