Dialogue[]

Yousuke: Hello, how may I help you?
 Are you Yousuke?
Yousuke: Oh, you must be the traveler that solved the Mikage Furnace incident with Mr. Xavier.
Yousuke: It's very nice to meet you- I've heard so much about you. I am Yousuke, indeed, and I am currently providing oversight of the Mikage Furnace repair efforts.
Yousuke: To be honest though, I'm good with crafts and everything, but I'm pretty awful at all the paperwork...
Yousuke: Still, I will keep at it and hopefully become someone as reliable as Sir Hanbei!
 That's not necessary...
Yousuke: Hmm? But I heard that Sir Hanbei is well recognized and been tasked with great responsibilities...
Yousuke: Nevertheless, I will work as hard as I am able. Thank you once again Traveler, for all that you've done for the Mikage Furnace.
 Goodbye.
Yousuke: Take care now.
