Despite being the fourth-generation master of the Futsu School, Hiroyoshi's skill never reached the height of his mother, Futsu Minori's, or his sworn brother, Futsu Masayoshi's. This nearly led to a succession crisis after Minori's death, as Masayoshi had reforged her famous blade and created Haran Geppaku Futsu. To avoid this, Masayoshi taught Hiroyoshi his mother's techniques and, once Hiroyoshi could support the school on his own, left the Futsu School.[1]
