 Adventure Challenge
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Swan: Good game, but I think you let me win.
(If the player wins the match)

Swan: What a way to win. I've been schooled.
 About Stormterror...
(Unlocked after completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
Swan: Stormterror? One moment, let me try to recall the Knights of Favonius Handbook...
Swan: I'm sorry, I don't remember anything in there that tells us what to do when facing giant dragons.
Swan: Oh, but I do remember that it does mention how to deal with sudden threats:
Swan: "When danger is imminent, please do not panic. Cover your head with both hands, and crouch down to protect your vital parts."
Swan: I think l'll do as this says...
(Unlocked after A Long Shot)
Swan: It's over at last. We can finally breathe easy.
Swan: We should suggest to the higher-ups that we need to add "what to do in the even of a giant dragon's appearance" to the Knights of Favonius Handbook.
Swan: Still, such a thing is unlikely to happen a second time...
 Who are you?
Swan: I'm Swan. I mostly perform sentry duty.
Swan: I also provide any necessary assistance to our business visitors in accordance with the Knights of Favonius Handbook.
 Knights of Favonius Handbook?
Swan: Yes. The Knights of Favonius Handbook is our instructional guide, and also the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in Mondstadt...
 Is there anywhere good to go in Mondstadt?
Swan: ...
 ...
Swan: ...
Swan: ...
Swan: ...Sorry, I can't find anything at all about that in the Knights of Favonius Handbook...
 Goodbye.
Swan: Bye-bye!
Swan: May Barbatos and his gentle wind protect you!
