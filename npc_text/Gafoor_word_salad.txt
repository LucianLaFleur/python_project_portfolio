Thoughts[]
Gafoor's thoughts can be accessed by using Nahida's Elemental Skill, All Schemes to Know.


Gafoor: (Don't get hurt, or I'll have to cover the damages... I don't wanna pay from my own pocket!)

Dialogue[]

Gafoor: We need more manpower. How are we supposed to manage with so few people? You know what? Just do as much as you can.
 About Lisa...
Gafoor: So you guys met Lisa in Mondstadt? Are you sure she's just a plain old librarian?
 Yes, what's so strange about that?
Gafoor: I didn't think there was anything about that backwater that would attract her there. Such a waste of talent.
Gafoor: ... Okay, I know you're Lisa's friend, and I'm not gonna talk to her about that again, so stop giving me that dirty look.
Gafoor: I was kind enough to offer her a chance, but she didn't seem keen. Fine by me, I guess.
 About Spantamad...
Gafoor: Yes, we carry out regular monitoring of the workings of Ley Lines. This is one of our fundamental research principles.
Gafoor: There are not enough talented folk who are professional and can independently undertake the work of exploring the Ley Lines. I've long said that we should allocate more people to come here...
Gafoor: Alas, I can't find any researchers, so I have to recruit willing volunteers.
 Farewell.
Gafoor: It's up to you to explore and clean up this Domain.
