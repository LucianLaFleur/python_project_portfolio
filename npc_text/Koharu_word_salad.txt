Profile[]
Koharu introduces herself as one of the house servants of the Kamisato Clan. In reality, she is implied by Furuta to be a member of the Shuumatsuban and a rookie under training in Ninjutsu. Furuta also describes her as someone who lacks composure.[1]
According to the Puppy Union Admission Details that Heizou had given to the Traveler during the event Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness, it was revealed that Koharu was one of the many people who were rescued from the warzone, with her codename being General Crab No. 3. She was 25 years old during the events of that war.[2] This implies that after the Yashiro Commission helped her to safety under the banner of the Puppy Union, they recruited her into the Shuumatsuban, while giving her the cover of a house servant of the Kamisato Clan.
