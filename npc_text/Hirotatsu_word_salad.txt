Dialogue[]

Hirotatsu: What can I help you with? If you are here to seek an audience with the Commissioner or Miss Kamisato, please go talk to Mr. Madarame.
 And you are...
Hirotatsu: My name is Hirotatsu, a member of the Yashiro Commission. I am in charge of the security of both Miss Kamisato and this mansion.
 Tell me more about the Yashiro Commission.
Hirotatsu: Oh? Do you have business with the Commissioner?
Hirotatsu: He is very busy. The various affairs at the Yashiro Commission have all but tied his hands, and he still has to deal with the other two Commissions...
Hirotatsu: My master and I have been taken good care of by the Commissioner before, so I will try my best to help him out.
Hirotatsu: Though all I can do now is be a good guard... Therefore, I will protect the mansion and Miss Kamisato with my life to repay the Commissioner!
 Goodbye.
Hirotatsu: Yeah, you take care as well.
