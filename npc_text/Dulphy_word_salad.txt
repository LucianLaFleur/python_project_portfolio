Traveler meets Dulphy when her troupe is searching for an actress to replace her in the troupe's last show to honor their deceased director, Aurelie. Dulphy was born with an incurable illness and abandoned by her parents. She lived on the streets having trouble with earning money, until she met Aurelie, who took her in, trained in singing and acting, and paid for her medication. Dulphy is stubborn, trying to push through her illness flare-ups and weakening medicine help to see the final show of the troupe going. After the show, where she had to be replaced by Furina last minute, she decides to prioritize her health.
