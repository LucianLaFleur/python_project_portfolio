Dialogue[]

Cassigneul: Things are looking up for Lumidouce Harbor, but someone will have to put in a lot of work in order for it to become a true success story.
 Excuse me, what is this place...?
Cassigneul: Welcome. I'm Cassigneul, the administrator of Lumidouce Harbor. I hope you have an enjoyable journey.
 About Lumidouce Harbor...
Cassigneul: Lumidouce Harbor is one of the Court of Fontaine's most vital foreign trading ports. It also handles the bulk of the trade coming from the south.
Cassigneul: Due to such enormous volume, the former administrator, Mr. Doutey, had plans to expand the harbor.
Cassigneul: The intent was not only to increase the harbor's size, but also to construct numerous auxiliary facilities such as hotels, restaurants, and taverns.
Cassigneul: However, all plans had to be called off due to certain unforeseeable circumstances, and Mr. Doutey resigned from his position.
Cassigneul: After that, I was assigned to take over.
Cassigneul: *sigh* He was a good man, but he simply couldn't catch a break.
 Have you managed a harbor before?
Cassigneul: I've been involved in handling some harbor management-related matters in the past, but this is my first time in an official managerial role.
Cassigneul: To be perfectly frank, the pressure is enormous. Especially in a crucial port like Lumidouce Harbor with not just a high volume of cargo, but also trade involving so many different nations...
Cassigneul: But since I've taken on this role, I've got expectations to live up to, and people whom I can't let down. I have to ensure that this critical trade hub runs smoothly.
Cassigneul: The trade volume at Lumidouce Harbor keeps on rising. I really need to find a way to reintroduce those expansion plans. I should seek out Mr. Doutey when I get the chance.
 I wish you a good day at work.
Cassigneul: Thank you. I have every faith that my project here will proceed smoothly. I believe in this harbor and everyone who works here.
Cassigneul: Speaking of which, please take these gifts. Once again, I welcome you to Lumidouce Harbor and wish you a pleasant journey.
(Obtain  Lumidouce Bell ×3)
 Goodbye.
Cassigneul: Goodbye. Bon voyage.
