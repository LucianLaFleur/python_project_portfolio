Kuki Miyuki (Japanese: 幸 Miyuki) is an open-world NPC initially located in Kujou Encampment, Inazuma, where talking to her starts the Tatara Tales World Quest Series. After completing it, she moves south to overlook one of the Thunder Sakura, where she can be talked to again to start the World Quest Sakura Arborism.
After both quests are finished, she moves to the stairs towards the Grand Narukami Shrine.

Profile[]
Miyuki is a shrine maiden at the Grand Narukami Shrine, belonging to the Kuki Clan who has long served the shrine. She is the older sister of Kuki Shinobu, the deputy of the Arataki Gang. Back when Shinobu planned to leave the shrine, Miyuki intended to persuade her not to, but after seeing that Shinobu had received a Vision, she changed her mind and decided to help her persuade their parents to let her go her own path instead.
The Traveler first meets Miyuki at the Kujou Encampment, where she was found arguing with Tenryou Commission officer Toranosuke regarding the situation at the Mikage Furnace. Toranosuke believed that the Grand Narukami Shrine overstepped their bounds by ordering the evacuation of the furnace, hindering the war effort, while Miyuki fired back that the Tatarigami was growing out of control and that the Tenryou Commission was not doing their job properly. With Toranosuke's superior, Hanbei, having headed to Inazuma City to deal with "proper procedures," the two were left at an impasse, resolved only by Xavier and the Traveler taking matters into their own hands.
With one crisis resolved, Miyuki turned her attention to the deteriorating Thunder Sakura around Kannazuka and noticed a particular Treasure Hoarder camp loitering around the trees. The Traveler helped her investigate the situation and discovered that Hideaki's group and Fatui were collaborating to take Electro-filled sap from the Thunder Sakura and empower an Electro Hypostasis. The two foiled the scheme and Miyuki captured Hideaki for interrogation.

Dialogue[]

Miyuki: Hi there, you can come to me if there's anything you need help with.
Miyuki: I have to work harder in my duties as a shrine maiden to earn the approval of Lady Yae, after all.
 What are a shrine maiden's duties?
Miyuki: Our duties are obviously to obey the commands of Lady Guuji Yae!
Miyuki: I will do my best to complete any instructions Lady Yae gives me, just as I did in Tatarasuna. I won't ever let her down.
 About Tatarasuna...
Miyuki: The problem with the Mikage Furnace has been resolved thanks to your help. You have my gratitude.
Miyuki: I've never worked in a place so far away, and I heard many interesting stories along the way.
Miyuki: It's said that the Sangonomiya troops are actually led by a shrine maiden. I never thought that a shrine maiden would be able to command a battlefield at the frontlines...
Miyuki: I wish I could meet her, I'm quite curious as to what she's actually like...
 Lady Yae's approval, huh...
Miyuki: Yes! Lady Yae praised me after I completed my mission in Tatarasuna. That was the happiest moment of my life!
Miyuki: That's why from that day on. I've decided to work even harder to serve Lady Yae. I want to become a shrine maiden whom Lady Yae can count on even more than Kano Nana!
Miyuki: *sigh* I really don't understand why Lady Yae and Kano Nana are so close. She even shares her secrets with her...
Miyuki: Hmph. I mean, I can outperform her in many ways, for sure!
 I'll not bother you. Goodbye.
Miyuki: *sigh* So you don't need any help?
Miyuki: Alright then, I guess I'll keep waiting on Lady Yae's instructions...

Quite the character, I'm told. Although she comes from a family of shrine maidens, she's gone her own way in life — tried her hand at many different trades, studied abroad in Liyue, even ended up joining the Arataki Gang... Fascinating girl. Maybe I should have Miyuki introduce me. Yes, that'll work — Miyuki wouldn't dream of refusing my request.
