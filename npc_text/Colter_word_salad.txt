Profile[]
Colter is a member of the Spina di Rosula. He worked with Melus when they were younger, often bringing supplies to and from the Court of Fontaine and Poisson. When Melus supported Callas' decision with the aquabus system, Colter believed that Melus had lost his ability to think in return for loyalty.
At some point prior to the Traveler's arrival in Fontaine, he was found guilty of a crime and sentenced to the Fortress of Meropide to serve his sentence. During his time, he realized that Melus' logic was right and wanted to apologize to him when he was released.
After the Prophecy of Fontaine passed, Colter was released following the fulfillment of his sentence. However, he learns of Melus' death, leaving him anguished as he blames Navia for his demise. He made contact with Romeuf and his faction; while he did not share most of their views, he wanted to get revenge against Navia. Romeuf tasked Colter with assassinating Navia, but he was unsuccessful in doing so due to the Traveler accompanying her. This led to Romeuf becoming impatient, who sent Martinat to Fleuve Cendre to warn him that he was going to start his plot. Colter in turn tipped Romeuf's faction of the impending security measures that Florent was going to perform, allowing Romeuf and his faction to avoid detection.
The following day, as Romeuf began his plot, the Traveler was sent by Navia to stop them from detonating explosives. This gave Colter the chance to kill Navia, but his attempt was blocked by Florent. He expresses his anger towards her for her supposed incompetence, though Florent defends her from his accusations. He then tries to attack again with Romeuf's infiltrators, but is knocked out in the ensuing battle by her. Once the plot was foiled with all of Romeuf's members being taken into custody, Navia had the Maison Gardiennage bring Colter to her, where she told him that she understood his plight and would try to make Poisson a better place. Colter then realized that his anger was misguided and that there were circumstances that could not be avoided. Before he was taken away, Navia dismissed him from the Spina di Rosula, but told him that he would be welcome to return to Poisson once he finished serving his sentence.
