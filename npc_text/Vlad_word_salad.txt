Profile[]
When the Fatui established the Northland Bank in Liyue Harbor, Vlad was assigned to serve as a guard for the bank.
One time, Nadia accidentally left her letter for her brother at the bank while changing shifts. Vlad, mistaking it as a letter written for him, left a response. Afterwards, the two became pen pals, writing letters for the other to read during their shifts.
The two meet for the first time during the Lantern Rite event and, while neither seems to realize that the other is their pen pal, they find their conversation nostalgic. In the Version 1.3 trailer, the two can be seen enjoying the festival together.

Appearance[]
Vlad has orange hair and wears a mask and a black red Fatui uniform.

Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Vlad: Hmm? Are you talking to me?
Vlad: Sorry, it's been a while since someone has spoken to me, you literally caught me off guard.
Vlad: But... I don't really wish to actively socialize with the people here.
 Who are you?
Vlad: I am the guard here.
Vlad: This is the Northland Bank, which was opened in Liyue by Snezhnaya. It's also the only non-local bank here in Liyue.
Vlad: That's about all I know. If you would like to know more, you could talk to the manager.
 You don't want to socialize with others?
Vlad: Well, I did try to fit in at first, but eventually I realized it was no use and just gave up.
Vlad: Even though I've met a lot of people here, in the end, I couldn't help but still feel a certain distance between myself and them. I was never included as part of the group.
Vlad: And socializing with them is exhausting. At this point, I've lost all interest in trying...
Vlad: Perhaps there are just too many cultural differences.
 Goodbye.
Vlad: If you don't have any urgent matters, then you best be on your way. Idle chatter is not part of my duties here.

Nighttime[]

Vlad: Hmm? Are you talking to me?
Vlad: Sorry, I was just reminiscing about my hometown.
 What are you doing?
Vlad: I'm waiting for a boat, a boat that will come at an unknown time, a boat that will take me home.
Vlad: My name is Vlad. I was transferred from my home country of Snezhnaya to come work here in Liyue.
Vlad: I've already been in this city for some time now, but clearly it's impossible for me to fit in here. So I've sent an application to headquarters to be transferred back home, but I don't know when the boat will arrive.
Vlad: Even though I live here, I don't interact at all with the people of this city, except for just one person.
 Tell me about that person.
Vlad: She's also a guard at the Northland Bank like me, except I have the day shift, and she has the night shift.
Vlad: It's as if I'm the sun, and she's the moon. Even though we're aware of one another's existence, our paths will never meet. I guess that's just how it's meant to be.
Vlad: Then one day out of the blue, she left a letter for me right where we change the guard. We've been writing each other as pen pals ever since.
Vlad: Although I can't wait for the boat to arrive, reading her letters is the only thing that makes my heart feel at ease.
 Goodbye.
Vlad: Goodbye. May the comfort of home never leave your side.

Event Dialogue[]
Lantern Rite[]

Vlad: H—Hello... Judging from your attire, we must be from the same place, no?
Nadia: Hmm? Ah yes, hello. Sorry, I seldom meet other Snezhnayans around here.
Vlad: The Lantern Rite sure is beautiful, isn't it?
Nadia: Yes, but it seems that there's still much to come yet. The Mingxiao Lantern is the height of the festivities. At least, that's what I've heard.
Vlad: Ah yes, so it seems. I've only just arrived here recently... I've come here alone, so there are still many things I don't quite understand yet.
Nadia: Oh? I've also arrived recently myself, so I often come here alone to watch the ships sail from Snezhnaya.
Vlad: ...Though I know that these boats rolling in and out of the port are not the ones to take me back home. Huh, what a coincidence... I also often come and watch the boats here.
Nadia: Are you sure we've never met before?
Vlad: Could we have met before? Perhaps my memory is failing me... I apologize, it would be impolite if I've forgotten.
Nadia: No, no, I'm sure we've never met. Though I feel that something is... awfully familiar when I'm speaking with you.
Vlad: Ah, is that so... Well, that's perfectly alright...
Nadia: The Lantern Rite... It sure is beautiful, isn't it?

Moonlight Merriment[]
Nighttime[]

Vlad: It's festival time here in Liyue again. Thanks for accepting my invitation to view the moon together...
Vlad: I'd originally planned to invite you to some famous restaurant, but I didn't think that they'd been fully booked ages ago...
Nadia: It's alright. I've heard that the theme of this festival is gourmet food. It's not all that surprising that there were no tables left.
Vlad: Eh? I—Is that so... So that's why I couldn't book any seats...
Vlad: Looks like my lack of understanding about Liyue was to blame. I'm sorry...
Nadia: Eh? Oh, no, you don't have to apologize...
Nadia: Just being able to relax and watch the bright moon together is good enough for me.
Nadia: Don't you think the moon at this time is brighter and rounder than usual?
Vlad: Oh, is it? ...No, I mean... You're right. It truly is very beautiful.

Fleeting Colors in Flight[]

(Outside the Northland Bank during the day)
Vlad: The Lantern Rite fireworks are ever so beautiful. I'd love to watch them again with her before the boat arrives...
Vlad: Uh, sorry. Were you talking to me?
(Continue non-event dialogue)

The Exquisite Night Chimes[]

(After completing A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul)
Vlad: I didn't know that you liked music so much... I'm so glad I invited you here.
Nadia: And thank you for inviting me. I've never had such a great time enjoying live music...
Nadia: I don't know much about music, but with the person beside— Ahem, with all these people around, it's been a great experience.
Vlad: That's great! You've always been a quiet person, so I was afraid you wouldn't like this kind of event.
Vlad: Looks like I should keep an eye out for more music festivals like this in the future...

Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze[]

(After completing The Glede Returns to the Pavilion (Quest))
Vlad: Do you ever think that there might be some kites that can no longer be retrieved after being sent up to the sky?
Nadia: I guess so? Even if you could control the line, the wind might decline your commands all the same.
Nadia: Speaking of that, should we go buy one? I mean, I haven't flown one before, so I'm not sure if it'll work out...
Vlad: Or... What say we make one together? I've seen kids discussing the patterns they want to draw on theirs, so it might not be that difficult.
Nadia: The two of us... Sure, let's give it a go!

Trivia[]
Nadia and Vlad's relationship seems to be evolving whenever a major festive event happens in Liyue Harbor:
Based on their normal dialogue, they acknowledged each other when Nadia forgot a letter meant for her brother at her post when changing shifts. Vlad mistook it as a letter meant for him and wrote a reply, to which Nadia then replied too, as she could tell he was lonely. They started to communicate this way, however they still did not know each other's name.
During Lantern Rite, they met for the first time in person while admiring the lanterns. They were both unaware that they are each other's penpal, however Nadia had a sense of familiarity when talking to Vlad.
During Moonlight Merriment, they had a date and went moongazing.
During Fleeting Colors in Flight, they watched the fireworks display together and both wished to see it again (Nadia with her penpal, Vlad with Nadia).
During The Exquisite Night Chimes, they fulfilled their promise from last year to watch the fireworks together, this time along with Xinyan, Hu Tao, and Dvorak's music show. Nadia started to enjoy spending time with Vlad (not mentioning her penpal anymore), but Vlad mistaken it for Nadia's enjoying the music, upon which he intends to keep an eye out for music festivals for their next date.
During Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze, they resolved to make a kite together.
Nadia and Vlad's dialogue during Moonlight Merriment only triggers at nighttime (19:00 – 06:00). During daytime, they will each have their own usual dialogue instead, even though they both remain on the dock standing next to each other.
Nadia and Vlad's separate dialogue after the fireworks in Fleeting Colors in Flight only occur during their shifts at the Northland Bank. Their off-shift dialogue remains the same. Immediately after the fireworks display, they will spend the day together by the dock before going back to their usual positions.
He shares his English voice actor with Cyno.
