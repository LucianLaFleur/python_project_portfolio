Dialogue[]

Kumar: Greetings. May Lesser Lord Kusanali bless you.
 You are...
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

Kumar: I live in Vimara Village, so you'll probably see me around if you visit here often.
Kumar: Hmm... My elder brother, Banka, may try to stop me, but I think it's fine to tell you that I have Eleazar.
Kumar: Have you heard about this disease in Sumeru? Scales gradually cover the body of the person until they are rendered immobile...
Kumar: The doctors recommended that I live in an environment of rich flora because it can alleviate my pain.
Kumar: While there are reasons for this that I do not know, I'm sure the blessings of Lesser Lord Kusanali are part of it, right?
Kumar: After all, everything in Sumeru is linked to her after the Greater Lord's departure.
 Take care of yourself.
Kumar: Thanks, but there's no need to worry. My condition is quite stable now.
Kumar: If I just continue resting as usual, then even if I can't train and hunt as my brother hopes, my condition shouldn't be too bad.
Kumar: My only regret... is probably that I can't go to the city and experience the Sabzeruz Festival.
Kumar: I heard the Akademiya isn't holding the Sabzeruz Festival as often as it used to. I may never get to attend one if that goes on...
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

Kumar: I'm one of the residents here in Vimara Village. If you came around often before, you might've seen me here.
Kumar: Not that any of that matters now, though. By the grace of Lesser Lord Kusanali, my illness has been completely healed!
Kumar: I'm not sure if you've heard, but we have this disease here in Sumeru that causes scales to gradually cover someone's body until they are rendered immobile...
Kumar: To be honest, I was prepared for the worst, but thanks to our archon's miraculous touch, I have a future again.
Kumar: Haha, let's see who dares to doubt her power now!
 That's wonderful. What do you plan to do next?
Kumar: To be honest, I'm not quite used to my body being this healthy.
Kumar: Well, have I got lots of things I want to do! I'd like to train and hunt with my elder brother, and I'd like to go outisde Vimara Village and explore the world!
Kumar: That said, he's still quite worried about me, and has suggested that I stay in the village for a while more to observe my condition ─ and that I should read a couple more books in the meantime.
 You, too.
Kumar: Thank you, goodbye.
