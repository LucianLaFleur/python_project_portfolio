Profile[]
Nacker is a senior researcher at the Fontaine Research Institute who once worked alongside Edwin Eastinghouse.
During the events of quest series, Nacker has the Traveler assist him in collecting several Survey Anchors, some of which were situated on the ruins of the original institute. Nacker was experienced enough to head to the Central Laboratory Ruins, where he wanted to bring the ruins back to the ground. When they reached the top of the ruins, they discovered an Experimental Field Generator that was responsible for the explosion. Claiming to have the situation under control once the clockwork meka were removed from the area, he used Raimondo's catalyst to transform a large Arkhium chunk into its Tri-Arkhium state.
Instead, Nacker overloaded the Arkhium and damaged the cooling mechanism, causing an explosion which caused the Traveler and Raimondo to investigate. Raimondo believed that Nacker was still alive, though he was nowhere to be seen following the explosion, and expressed disappointment in that he thought the benefits he gave him was not enough. Raimondo explained that the ruins contained a large amount of excited Arkhium, which could explode and the large chunk was designed to prevent it from occurring. Nacker's tampering also reactivated the field generator found in the ruins, though the Traveler and Raimondo quickly shut it down once the machine was stabilized.
The Traveler could then choose to tell Chronie the truth of the incident or let Raimondo attempt to cover it up. Nacker would eventually relocate to a hideout underneath the Fort Charybdis Ruins to continue working on his own field generator, believing that he could surpass his technology and created a modified field generator. He would use this generator on the Traveler when they infiltrated his headquarters, but it was promptly destroyed and he was apprehended along with Edwin and returned to the Institute, where they were picked up by the Maison Gardiennage and sent to the Fortress of Meropide, where he cut off ties with them and declared his research days over, though he was impressed with Jurieu's creation, The Wingalet.

Dialogue[]

Nacker: ...It's you. Come to see the pathetic loser, have you?
 Are you enjoying your stay?
Nacker: Of course. Here, I don't have to ponder over complex technical issues or constantly be forced to recall each and every step of painfully precise operations.
Nacker: More importantly, I don't have to deal with those short-sighted, arrogant fools
Nacker: Based on those few facets alone, the Fortress of Meropide is vastly preferable to the Fontaine Research Institute.
(After completing Masquerade of the Guilty)

Nacker: Oh, and I noticed that Jurieu fellow managed to build the Wingalet. He does seem to have some talent.
Nacker: Mr. Edwin's assistant has completed a significant undertaking, while Edwin himself remains where he started, empty-handed and frustrated.
Nacker: Hahahahaha! Serves you right, Edwin!
 You fooled everyone in the Central Laboratory.
Nacker: Yes, and I have to thank you once again. Without your cooperation, which you gave freely, I would have never figured out how to discreetly send that reporter lady packing.
Nacker: Still, I underestimated Raimondo's perspicacity. I never expected him to be able to uncover the truth, least of all in a situation like that.
 What did Concini promise you?
Nacker: I don't give a hoot about his promises. I just don't want the Institute to terminate the Arkhium research project.
Nacker: Countless people put their hearts and souls into it, myself included. It's just a step away from fruition!
Nacker: If they pull the plug now, all of our magnificent research will have been for nothing!
Nacker: Raimondo, that fool, he's far too conservative! All he cares about is securing his own career. He couldn't care less about the state of the Institute.
 And you're just looking out for your own interests.
Nacker: It's my research too! Do you have any idea how much effort I put into helping create the Arkhium Kinetic Core? Why can't I look out for my own interests, like the rest of you?
Nacker: Am I supposed to meekly submit to Choiseul's will and give up on Arkhium, just like that?
Nacker: All just to focus on mind-numbingly tedious contraptions like Mekafish, Fonta, and the like? I'd rather die!
Nacker: Talking about this now is an exercise in futility, anyway. I no longer have any ties to the Fontaine Research Institute.
Nacker: Arkhium, the Arkhium Kinetic Core, the future Fontaine Research Institute... Whatever. Let it all be.
Nacker: My research days are over.
 ...Bye.
Nacker: Leave. You've already won. Don't come back.
