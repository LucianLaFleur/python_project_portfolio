Profile[]
Eduardo is a Fontaine figure and a prominent figure in Fleuve Cendre before the cataclysm 500 years ago. He used to operate taverns in Fleuve Cendre, where the Parsifal the Great and her younger sister Josephine performed when they were just starting their careers.[2]
Eduardo and his wife had their child Jakob born in Fleuve Cendre, in the underground of Court of Fontaine. Initially, Eduardo protected the residents of Fleuve Cendre, using a bronze pipe to defeat the "richly nutritious water" and countless "livestock," such as crocodiles. He also protected the merchants from getting extorted, harassed, and blackmailed by the gangs, resolving the disputes between Fleuve Cendre "compatriots", and blessing the newly wedded. Eduardo became an outlaw leader who maintained order in Fleuve Cendre, gathering numerous followers. He once declared, "Let all that the sun shines upon belong to them, and let the Fleuve Cendre belong to us."
Eduardo was among those arrested resisting the purge of the Fleuve Cendre, and while being escorted to exile in the desert. He was rescued by his henchmen. Banding together with comrades active near Mont Automnequi, they occupied Poisson, and seizing the members of the Maison Gardiennage charged with transporting them as hostages, they made a series of unreasonable demands.[1] Parsifal, or possibly Josephine, who portrayed "Parsifal", also joined Eduardo's resistance group.[1][2]Before the situation deteriorated further, Karl Ingold took a photograph of Eduardo, Jakob, the current mayor of Poisson Renault de Petrichor and his son Rene de Petrichor, "Parsifal", Rosa Reed and her husband Thompson with their infant, and Tom Alter.[1]
Eduardo presumably died during the Siege of Poisson.[3][4][5] Eduardo's son Jakob and Renault's son Rene were sent to the Narzissenkreuz Institute. 
"Parsifal" used her trick to save Karl during the siege.[6] Many years later, during the cataclysm, the Narzissenkreuz Institute was submerged in water. Before Basil Elton set out, she entrusted Jakob and Rene to Karl, leading Jakob to change his surname to Ingold.[7]
