 Professional navigator...
Media:VO Chambelland 01.ogg "Professional navigator, here! Hire me and you'll have no need to fear!"

Dialogue[]

Chambelland: Hey, Boss, need a navigator? I'm your man!
 You're the navigator here?
Chambelland: I am... or was, rather, the best navigator in Lumidouce Harbor. I know these waters like the back of my hand.
Chambelland: I can help you bring in even a tiny raft into the harbor without capsizing.
 You used to be...?
Chambelland: Um... Ahem! I'd say the future of those working in Lumidouce Harbor isn't very bright. It's practically a black hole for career progression, and the pay is lousy. It's better to strike out on your own.
(Before completing An Expected Lie)‍[or possibly An Expected Plan?]

Chambelland: Boss, if you hire me, I... I could help you make some connections. I know Chaussivert, and with his protection, there ain't nobody in the world who would dare lay a finger on your cargo.
(After completing An Expected Lie)‍[or possibly An Expected Plan?]

Chambelland: Boss, if you hire me, I... I could help you make some connections. I know—
Chambelland: Wait a minute, you're...! Oh my goodness! It's an honor to see you here. I've heard Mr. Chaussivert talk about you. You're truly exceptional!
Chambelland: If you decide to hire me for the job, I'll give you a... let's say, 20% discount!
Chambelland: Why don't you think it over? If you ever decide to hire me, you know where to find me.
 Goodbye.
Chambelland: Goodbye! If you want to hire me, you know where to find me.
