Dialogue[]

Amir: These guys just love running about when they aren't working.
Amir: I hope they pay close attention to that girl's condition and report any changes immediately.
 Duel
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Amir: Haha, I narrowly won...
(If the player wins the match)

Amir: Ah, I thought I was going to win, but I guess I overthought the whole thing, haha...
 These guys?
Amir: Yeah, these fluffy guys. They just refuse to sit still, and they keep running around and making noise all day.
Amir: Luckily, they get serious when it's time for work. Otherwise, I would have taught them another good lesson.
 Fluffy... Forest Watchers?
Amir: Haha, I think you've misunderstood. I didn't mean my colleagues, I meant these doggies.
Amir: They may seem like they're all over the place, but they're actually very reliable. They're good friends and assistants for our forest patrol work.
Amir: As for myself, I am responsible for managing and training these search and rescue dogs.
Amir: Sag is my best student, so I appointed it captain of the search and rescue dog team. If you can't find a Forest Watcher or a Forest Ranger, you can ask it for help too.
 That girl?
(Before finishing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies‍[verification needed])
Amir: Oh... She's a Trainee Forest Ranger with us.
Amir: She... is in poor health, so she's here to learn and recuperate at the same time.
Amir: She's so young yet so eager to excel. I'm still quite worried about her condition.
Amir: That's why I asked the search and rescue dogs to pay attention to her condition and notify me immediately if something happens. That's the only way I can be there in time to help her.
 I can help too.
Amir: That means a lot to me. Ah, how I wish more kind people like you would join the Forest Rangers.
Amir: By the way, are you heading to Avidya Forest? If so, let me give you some common herbs that might come in handy.
(Obtain  Nilotpala Lotus ×4)
 So, who's that girl?
(After finishing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies‍[verification needed])
Amir: Oh... She's a Trainee Forest Ranger who's currently stationed with us.
Amir: She's only just recovered from a very serious illness, but it seems that she's been trying a bit too hard recently.
Amir: She's been all over the shop, so much so that I've started to worry that she might go running off into a storm again just to rescue someone.
Amir: That's why I've asked our search and rescue dogs to pay attention to her condition and notify me immediately if something happens. That's the only way that I can be there in time to help her.
 I can help too.
Amir: That means a lot to me. Ah, how I wish more kind people like you would join the Forest Rangers.
Amir: By the way, are you heading to Avidya Forest? If so, let me give you some common herbs that might come in handy.
(Obtain  Nilotpala Lotus ×4)
 See you.
Amir: Goodbye. Safe travels.
