Profile[]
Yi Xian is a young girl living in Liyue Harbor with her older brother, Yi Zhu. Their mother died under unknown circumstances, shortly before the Traveler's arrival, and at Yi Xian's young age, she didn't fully understand the situation. Their father is unaccounted for and can be presumed deceased; as a result, other people in the city, such as Changshun, have been helping Yi Zhu take care of her.
By the time of the Lantern Rite event, Yi Xian has come to grips with her mother's death, which is reflected in her dialogue with her brother.

Appearance[]
She is a small young girl with fair skin, black hair and black eyes. She wears a long brown dress with a bow-like knot on the collar.

(Talk to either Yi Xian or Yi Zhu during the day)
Yi Zhu: Come on Yi Xian, there's a good girl. It's home time...
Yi Xian: I'm not going home! I'm going to look for Mommy!
Yi Zhu: But Mommy isn't coming home...
Yi Xian: *sobs* Why won't Mommy come home... Does Mommy not love us anymore?
Yi Zhu: Hey, don't say such silly things...
Yi Xian: But, but... I know I saw the lady with black clothes bring Mommy here... *sobs*
Yi Zhu: Yi Xian, what happened was... Mommy is one of the stars in the sky now.
Yi Xian: You mean Mommy isn't sleeping anymore? ...You're lying, I don't believe you!
Yi Zhu: I'm telling the truth, Yi Xian... Listen, how about we wait till nighttime and I take you up onto the roof? When you see the starlight, you will feel Mommy's loving eyes looking down...

Event Dialogue[]
Lantern Rite[]

(Talk to either Yi Xian or Yi Zhu during the day)
Yi Xian: ...Mommy always used to take us to Xiao Market...
Yi Zhu: Yeah! Mommy would buy toys for us, take us to see the Xiao Lanterns... And she'd carry you when you got tired...
Yi Xian: ...Yi Zhu, I miss Mommy.
Yi Zhu: Yi Xian... Don't cry, let's make a Xiao Lantern for Mommy, shall we?
Yi Xian: Huh? But I thought Xiao Lanterns were to remember the heroes who look after us...
Yi Zhu: You're right. Well, our mommy was a hero and she looked after us, didn't she?
Yi Zhu: So come on, wipe your tears away — let's welcome back Mommy's spirit and all the other heroes with big smiles on our faces!
Yi Xian: Alright!

Fleeting Colors in Flight[]

(Talk to either Yi Xian or Yi Zhu during the day)
Yi Xian: Yi Zhu, I miss Mommy again... I wanna accompany her to see the Xiao Market...
Yi Zhu: Don't cry, Xian... I'll go with you this year, alright?
Yi Zhu: Let's go buy some toys, check out the Xiao Lanterns, and watch the fireworks. I'll carry you on my back if you get tired.
Yi Xian: Yi Zhu... *sobs*
Yi Xian: Then... will you teach me how to make Xiao Lanterns this year? I'd like to make Mommy one.
Yi Zhu: Of course I can. We made one for her together last year. This year, I'll teach you, and you'll be able to make one yourself!
Yi Xian: Yep!
Yi Zhu: When Mommy sees your Xiao Lantern, her spirit will return, together with all those other heroes. Then, we'll welcome her back with big smiles on our faces!
Yi Xian: Yeah!

Trivia[]
In Linling's Anthology of Selected Poetry, she complains about "Changchang's" constant crying. However, she probably meant Yi Xian, and simply didn't remember which child was which.
The siblings' names are most likely a reference to The Inlaid Harp (Chinese: 锦瑟 Jǐnsè), a poem composed by Li Shangyin, a poet and politician during the 9th century.
The second verse of the poem is 一弦一柱思华年 which loosely translates to "Each string (yixian), each bridge (yizhu) [of this fifty-string harp] makes me recall the glorious days of my youth [with my beloved one]."
Reinterpreting the verse while treating 一弦 yīxián, "one string" and 一柱 yīzhù, "one bridge" as names results in this possible interpretation: "Yi Xian and Yi Zhu yearn for their happy days."
Their names may be based on a viral story of a man who named his children Yi Xian and Yi Zhu after his wife Nianhua passed away since the verse may also be interpreted as "Yi Xian and Yi Zhu miss [their mother] Nianhua."
