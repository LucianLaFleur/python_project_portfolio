Profile[]
Schubert, a noble from the disgraced Lawrence Clan, wished to take Mondstadt back from the Knights of Favonius to bring the city back under "proper" rule. Sergei was given responsibility over the operation and took an immediate disliking to the noble due to his self-centered arrogance.
Schubert's plot was eventually foiled by the Traveler and his niece Eula. Sergei confronted the two at the end of the hideout, but was ultimately defeated by them.
