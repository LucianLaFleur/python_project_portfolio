Dialogue[]

Anand: Taking care of every ship going through the port is a must.
Condition missing
 Is there anything of note nearby?
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Anand knows)
Anand: Speaking of which, one of my employers told me today that there are some good ores nearby, even including those rare Magical Crystal Ores! They asked if I wanted to mine some for repair materials.
Anand: Too bad. I can repair ships, but I didn't learn about mining ores, It's somewhere in this location. Go give it a try if you're interested.
(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Anand knows)
Anand: Doesn't seem like there's anything special...
Anand: The ships are sailing like normal, and the ocean surface is calm. It's a good day.
 Hello.
Anand: Hello. Did you get here on a ship?
Anand: If the vessel needs maintenance, please come see me.
Anand: I take care of every ship going through the port.
 Good job.
Anand: It's part of what I do.
Anand: The only concern I have is manpower shortage.
Anand: The competition between caravans has caused many artisans like us to change line of work.
Anand: But I won't leave, for my lover is a seafarer, so I understand how important ship safety is.
Anand: I heard there's an agency called the Communications Office in Liyue that specializes in overseas shipping logistics.
Anand: Don't you think that would solve the problem of cutthroat competition?
 See you.
Anand: Yeah, see you.
