Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available at the Qiaoying Village docks.


Bosu: Greetings, (‍young manyoung manText for male Traveler/young ladyyoung ladyText for female Traveler‍). Are you here to take the boat?
 Ride the bamboo raft to Yilong Wharf
Bosu: All set! Please take your seats and we'll be on our way.
 What are you reading off?
Bosu: It's a folk verse in Chenyu Vale. Every ferryman knows the words.
Bosu: This one is easy to understand. There's another, a more elegant one...
Bosu: "...The spring's cries ripple through the vales, the shrines depart from northeast shores. The heights and shallows in the southwest hide..."
Bosu: I'll sing you this one when you take the raft to Yilong Wharf.
 This boat is quite unique.
Bosu: Good taste!
Bosu: Chenyu Vale's shallow and has a lot of bends, so big ships would get stranded here all too easy.
Bosu: But not a raft! It's light and sits high on the water, so no bends or unseen reef can stop us.
Bosu: Most importantly, the scenery of Chenyu Vale can only be appreciated in detail from a raft.
 Sorry for bothering you.
Bosu: Goodbye! Have a safe journey.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available upon arriving at Yilong Wharf.


Bosu: Alright, we're here! Have a safe journey.

One of the songs is sung in Chinese in all dubs of the game. The lyrics of the song can be pieced together from the two ferrymen's dialogue:
幽谷涟涟泉响圜，灵龛先出东北岸，幽峦岸峻藏西南；乾阳临坤自相隔，长流涡不转，美玉藏其间。 Yōugǔ liánlián quánxiǎng huán, língkān xiān chū dōngběi àn, yōuluán ànjùn cáng xīnán; qián yáng lín kūn zì xiānggé, cháng liú wō bù zhuǎn, měiyù cáng qíjiān.The spring's cries ripple through the vales, the shrines depart from northeast shores. The heights and shallows in the southwest hide, sun and earth from each other divide, the eternal whirlpool that never churns, beautiful jade concealed within.
