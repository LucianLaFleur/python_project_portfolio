 Not about the money...

Dialogue[]

Sanin: ...No, no, that's not how this one goes...
Sanin: You usually tell the customer that a service is paid first, right? Telling me that only after you've taken the photos is just unreasonable!
Talvat: But taking photos comes at a cost too. The machines and the photos all cost Mora — that's just the way things are!
Sanin: That's not how that works. If you're rendering a service, you need to tell the customer if there's anything to note about it first!
Sanin: Take us at the Northland Bank, for example. When a client comes to us to have a service done, we will tell them — repeatedly at that! — that your way of doing business doesn't work.
Talvat: Well, this isn't the Northland Bank, and I mean, everyone else paid me!
Sanin: That they are willing to put up with something unreasonable is their problem! Don't you have a court? We'll take this up there!
Talvat: *sigh* You know what? Forget it. I won't take your Mora. But please, return me those pictures.
Sanin: No, no, no, this is not a question of Mora...
