Rekhar is one of the prop engineers for Zubayr Theater alongside Najia. She and her husband used to be adventurers. Back then, she was fearless and often charged head-first into danger. Unfortunately, she was forced to stop after her husband died in an accident. Today, she is content working for Zubayr Theater, where she is grateful to Zubayr and the rest of the theater for their support.
