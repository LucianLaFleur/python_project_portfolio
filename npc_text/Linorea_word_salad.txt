Profile[]
Linorea is a journalist who specializes in environmental issues. Her primary concern is the mechanical Mekafish created by the Fontaine Research Institute, which have run amok since the Institute's explosion and are killing the other fish in the waters. Her ultimate goal is to expose the Institute's wrongdoings by writing a report, but in the meantime, she and other environmentalists are focused on repopulating the Fontaine's fish population and destroying the Mekafish.[1]
She is dating Semaine,[2] a Gestionnaire at the Palais Mermonia.

Appearance[]
Linorea has red hair in a low bun and green eyes. In her everyday outfit, she wears a blue long-sleeved dress, white stockings, and black shoes. She sometimes dons a brown diver's suit, although it is nonfunctional.[1]
