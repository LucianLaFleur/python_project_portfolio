Profile[]
Ziri is a member of the Farrokhzadan under Lunja, who have been sent to the Avidya Forest to capture Aranara and acquire a Zohrah Mushroom. He and Minum first meet the Traveler at their camp in the forest before Lunja shows up and makes them leave with her, leaving behind their cooking pot (to the chagrin of both Minum and Ziri). The Traveler meets the two of them again outside the cave with the Zohrah Mushroom, where they refuse to let them enter on their boss' orders, but once again, Lunja makes them back off after she returns from inside the cave, and Lunja even makes them make a faux toast to the Traveler's health.
After Lunja steals the Zohrah Mushroom, she regroups with Minum and Ziri outside the cave, expecting to have escaped the Traveler. However, their reactions reveal that the Traveler has already caught up to her. In the ensuing confrontation, the Traveler makes Lunja give up the Zohrah Mushroom either through force or through a combination of bargaining and threats, and one way or another all three Eremites leave.
Before their current job, Ziri and the rest of Lunja's group were in Sumeru City to celebrate a successful job and play Genius Invokation TCG. However, Lunja ended up losing months' worth of their pay and they were driven out of the city. Ziri had a relationship with Dwarkanath and had also ordered a gold axe, both of which were ruined in the aftermath of Lunja's TCG fails, which drove Ziri to tears.[1]
