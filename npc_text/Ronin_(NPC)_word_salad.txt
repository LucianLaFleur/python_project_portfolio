Profile[]
The unnamed Ronin is part of a vagrant group who stole goods from the International Trade Association, knowing that the Kanjou Commission would not try to persecute them due to Inazuma's hostility towards foreigners. Ayaka, who was looking for silk so Ogura Mio could make some new robes for her, learned of the theft from Kurisu. Along with the Traveler, the ronin and his group were surprised to be discovered but bullied Kurisu into submission before demanding a payment to get the silk back. Ayaka, reminding Kurisu of their agreement, easily defeated the ronin and his group, causing them to scatter.
