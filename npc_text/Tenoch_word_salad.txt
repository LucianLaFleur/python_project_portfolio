Tenoch was a battle-hardened warrior from Natlan that existed before the creation of the Mare Jivari - possibly around 1000 years ago[Note 1][1] - and who wielded the giant obsidian club Talking Stick. He created a fellowship of six warriors from each of the six major tribes of Natlan - of which he belonged to none -  in order to fight against a growing threat on Natlan's horizon.[2] It is implied that he died during this fight in a heroic final battle.

Profile[]
Tenoch was a warrior-hero from Natlan who wielded a large obsidian-inlaid club. He did not to belong to any of the six major tribes, as it is said that he was chased away or expelled from his former tribe; perhaps for his propensity for battle. Although he didn't belong to any tribe, some members of other tribes and Tenoch's former friends had much respect for him. Tenoch also had many enemies, one of which was an infamous giant named Tupac, with whom he exchanged many injuries and scars. The club Tenoch wielded was known as the Talking Stick, as it is implied that he used it to "mediate" discussions and disputes. With his club, Tenoch journeyed across Natlan recruiting six warriors to fight with him against a "turbid black tide" he saw on the horizon. His fate is left uncertain after he begins his "final battle" against a mountain of darkness, though it is implied he perished during the fight.

Appearance[]
Tenoch is described as having many scars on his body, as well as possibly a missing or blinded eye.[2] It is also implied that Tenoch is at least middle-aged.

Story[]
~>1000 years ago[]
Tenoch, a lone warrior without a tribe, stood amongst the burning plains of Natlan and witnessed a darkness growing on the horizon. Suspecting an immediate danger, he blew his bronze horn but to no reply. He lamented that the tribal leaders were too absorbed in their squabbles to recognize the danger. It is here where he set out on a mission to recruit allies in order to do battle against the growing darkness. 
First, Tenoch meets with a former traveling partner, Wanjiru, known as "the great runner," and her companion, Kayeke. Wanjiru, scarred from her previous adventures with Tenoch, is worn out from the tribes' endless bickering, but she becomes enthusiastic from Tenoch's proposal, knowing a battle was imminent.
Tenoch then meets with a brave man by the name of Menilek, and his companion Ngoubou, who welcomes Tenoch with open arms as a brother and revered hero. This meeting is followed by one with "the cunning Sanhaj Kompore and his enigmatic companion Mahamba." It is implied here that Tenoch had used his club against Sanhaj in the past and that his recruitment was not entirely voluntary, though Tenoch did preemptively offer him the rewards of their fellowship should Sanhaj agree to join. Sanhaj, who had seen the future result of the upcoming battle and the creation of the Mare Jivari, reluctantly agreed in the hopes that he would be seen as a hero in future stories.
Tenoch then proceeded to meet with a young and inexperienced man named Burkina and his own companion Kongamato. Burkina looked up to Tenoch, though he had no battle experience of his own. Knowing he might one day walk the same path of a warrior as Tenoch, and guided by Tenoch's club and legacy, Burkina voluntarily joined the group of warriors.
Though there was some bitter history between the two, Sundjatta, "chief of the mines," was the fifth person to be persuaded by Tenoch, and was joined by his companion Muhuru. Sundjatta was one who had previously petitioned the then Pyro Archon - possibly Murata - to expel Tenoch from his tribe. He tells Tenoch that it was because he wished for stability and a cease to conflict that he did so. He agreed to go with Tenoch as he too imagined it would be the last battle of their generation, but also on the condition that his tribe be left out of any ensuing conflict.
The final member to join the fellowship was Tenoch's old rival, Tupac, whom he had previously engaged in many battles against. Upon Tenoch's arrival at Tupac's home, the two remark on how they've left each other with many injuries. They both then begin laughing hysterically before joining forces.
Having recruited some allies from each of the six major tribes, Tenoch and his comrades then clashed with the danger for which they had assembled to fight against.

Trivia[]
Aside from Iansan and Murata, two other named characters from the same nation, Tenoch is the first mentioned major character from Natlan, as well as the first to have a weapon and story attributed to him.
Xbalanque was mentioned earlier, but it is not yet confirmed to be from Natlan.
Etymology[]
Tenoch was a legendary chief and patriarch of pre-columbian Mexican and Aztec history. He is also the namesake of the Aztec Empire's capital, Tenochtitlan, and their people, Mexica or Tenochca.
Though the name Tenoch is of Aztec origin, the names of some other characters featured in his story are of various African origins.
The symbols used in Tenoch's Nahuatl name could possibly be translated to "Prickly pear fruit."
Notes[]

↑ The earliest mention of the Mare Jivari is in the Wanderer's Troupe artifact set. The characters mentioned in the set existed during Mondstadt's Aristocracy period but before Vennessa's rebellion, which is known to have taken place about 1000 years before the start of the game. This suggests that the latest date for this story to have occurred was at least 1000 years ago.
