Dialogue[]

Erfan: Pfft... Makes me laugh every time...
 Who are you...
Erfan: I am the one who walks under the veil of night, a listener of drunkards' most honest confessions...
Erfan: Hahaha, just kiddin'! I'm just a bartender working night shifts here.
Erfan: Many come here to drink at night. Some of them might get quite drunk. So Lambad had me take some of Qishan's shifts.
Erfan: An Akademiya student during the day and a bartender at night. I'd say I've managed to keep a good work-study balance.
 About Qishan...
Erfan: Qishan is the bartender during the day. Have you met her already?
Erfan: She's a student from Liyue who is now preparing for the entrance exam to the Akademiya. She also works to cover her tuition. That's hardly an easy life.
Erfan: I want to help, but I'm from a different school than the one she's aiming for.
Erfan: So I sometimes invite students from that school over for a drink. This way, she can discuss academic questions with them.
Erfan: I hope she will pass the exam. That will make me her senior!
 Is there anything fun about this place?
Erfan: Of course, there's lots of fun stuff.
Erfan: This is a tavern, after all. The last thing we lack is funny drunkards.
Erfan: Like last time, a student who had just come of age drank too much at his birthday party and, as a result, tried to have a duel with a chair.
Erfan: ...Well, the chair definitely turned out to be the stronger duelist.
Erfan: A Liyue student who came with him captured the hilarious moment and sent the pictures to The Steambird overnight.
Erfan: Guess what, one of the pictures earned the Second Prize for journalistic photography. I heard it was only second to the work of The Steambird's top reporter.
Erfan: If I were the drunken student, I'd blackmail... send a letter to ask for royalties.
 See you.
Erfan: Goodbye... Hahaha...

Erfan: What a blunder... I won't get to watch the competitions during the day if I'm working nights!
Erfan: That said... ah, I can't just dip work and go see the competition during the day, haha.
Erfan: Keeping that in mind gives me some balance. Maybe my classmates might fill me in on what's happening in the competition over some drinks at night.
Erfan: With the gala comes more tourists, and with more tourists comes an increase to my pay. I might even hear some new drunken jokes! Seems like I'm being well compensated for my time!

Trivia[]
Erfan's Darshan is unknown, but it is different than the one Qishan aims to enter.
Given Qishan's pronounced interest in shipbuilding, it may be assumed that she is aiming to enter Kshahrewar, as it is the Darshan most focused on mechanics and technology; this rules out Kshahrewar as Erfan's school affiliation.
