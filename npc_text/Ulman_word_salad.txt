Profile[]
Ulman is a treasure hunter seeking Iron Coins to resell them for Mora, which are found by his Treasure-Seeking Seelie companion. When asked about his companions, he replies that he does not trust them and would not collaborate with these "greedy churls", however he does seems to deal with them as they are the ones that, for a fee, found a boat for him to get to Inazuma. He calls himself a "Seelie magnet" as during his travels, he has encountered and partnered with several Treasure-Seeking Seelies, although all grew uninterested with him with some time. The Traveler and Paimon would run into him across Teyvat, where they would take the Seelies and dig up Iron Coins, giving it to him in exchange for various rewards.
Upon arriving in Fontaine, he ran into and partnered again with another Seelie, but after following it, soon discovered that it led underwater. After acquiring another batch of coins, Ulman begins to contemplate finding a way to cut out his middleman to increase profits and perhaps stop traveling.

Appearance[]
He has golden hair and wears a black hat with a white feather and a black-brown vest.

 I have some Iron Coins...

 Not yet...
Ulman: Well, it wouldn't be treasure if it was that easy to find. Take your time.

Inazuma version[]

Ulman: So, how has the treasure-hunting been going?
 I have some Iron Coins...
Ulman: Oh, do you? Wonderful! Now, I've got some pretty trinkets on me that I'll trade for them. What would you like?
(Opens the Event Shop menu)
 I'd like to view those treasure clues...
(Opens the Treasure Areas menu)
 Goodbye.
Ulman: Happy hunting, Traveler! See you!

Sumeru version[]

Ulman: I'm counting on you then, Traveler. I'm sure we're a good team.
 About treasure-seeking...
Ulman: So, have you found any "Ancient Iron Coins"?
(Opens the Event Shop menu)
 See you.
Ulman: I'm counting on you then, Traveler. Come back and bring me the "Ancient Iron Coins" if you find any.

Fontaine version[]

(Before completing Treasures Under the Sea: Epilogue)
Ulman: Yo! You're back so soon! Did you find the treasure?
 Show me what you've got.
Ulman: Sure, have a look!
(Opens the Event Shop menu)
 Why did you come to Fontaine?
Ulman: Of course I'm here to... Uh... do business! A few of my business partners came here, so of course I came as well.
Paimon: Hey, aren't those business partners of yours... Treasure Hoarders or something of the sort?
Ulman: No way! I'd never work with people like that! It'd be way too risky...
Ulman: Uh... Or at least I wouldn't work with them directly. If for some reason I had to work with them, I'd need to find a middleman.
(Dialogue returns to option selection)
 Goodbye.
Ulman: Goodbye! I leave retrieving the Ancient Iron Coins to you, remember to bring any you find to me! I'll definitely buy them for a good price.
(After completing Treasures Under the Sea: Epilogue)
Ulman: What to do, what to do... *sigh* Maybe I should just go straight back to Mondstadt...
Ulman: It's been so long that I've forgotten even the taste of Dandelion Wine...
 Show me what you've got.
Ulman: Sure, have a look!
(Opens the Event Shop menu)
 See you.
Ulman: See you next time! I've got a feeling we'll be working together again in the future. I'll be counting on you when the time comes!
