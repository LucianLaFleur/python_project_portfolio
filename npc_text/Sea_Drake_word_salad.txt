Dialogue[]

Sea Drake: Ah, perhaps this is a helmsman's fate...
 Who are you?
Sea Drake: I'm the helmsman of this ship. I never leave my post on voyage.
Sea Drake: If we have sudden encounters with reefs or whirlpools, I must be able to act swiftly. I can't afford to slacken my watch.
Sea Drake: It's not an easy job, but it's always been my dream to do this.
 Your dream?
Sea Drake: Well, I wanted to go on adventures all over the world at the helm of a large ship, sailing freely wherever I pleased. That's why I became a helmsman.
Sea Drake: Now that I'm the helmsman of the Alcor, half my dream has been realized. The other half may never be fulfilled, though, which is a shame.
Sea Drake: Though I'm the helmsman, where we're headed, what route we're taking... I still need to take orders from the Captain and our navigator on those matters.
Sea Drake: Honestly, it was a bit disappointing at first, but I think I got over it as time went by.
Sea Drake: Most people's lives are like that, anyway. Those who can control their own path will always be few and far between...
Sea Drake: I mean, at least I've met a leader who I can fully trust, you know? Captain Beidou will never lead us wrong.
 I'll leave you to it, then.
Sea Drake: Let's talk again when you're free.
