Dialogue[]

Connor: Welcome to Dawn Winery! Are you here for a tour?
 Who are you?
Connor: I'm Connor, a winemaker here at Dawn Winery. I've been here since Master Crepus was still in charge.
Connor: Master Crepus was also Master Diluc's father, the former owner of this winery.
Connor: Unfortunately, Mr. Crepus died in his prime, and now the burden of running the winery falls on Master Diluc's shoulders...
 Tell me about wine making.
Connor: Dandelion wine is the signature product of our winery, offering a unique sweetish and refreshing taste, and rich in cereal aroma.
Connor: As to how it is produced, I suggest you seek the answers in "On Beer Brewing" and "Distillation Technology."
Connor: They are thoroughly written books and easy to find in the library. But Master Diluc has never read them, not even once...
 Tell me about Diluc.
Connor: Although Master Diluc appears to have little interest in wine,
Connor: I believe he bears the same talent in winemaking as his father, only waiting for the right time to reveal itself.
Connor: The question is, when will that time come?
 Goodbye.
Connor: Are you leaving? If you happen to meet Master Diluc...
Connor: No, never mind... Please enjoy your stay at Dawn Winery.
