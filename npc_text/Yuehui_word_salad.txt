Profile[]
Yuehui is a miner in an independent crew. After The Chasm is reopened for surface mining, Yuehui's crew manages to secure a permit from Yujing Terrace allowing for limited ore mining in The Chasm. However, the miners have recently been seeing Hilichurls entering The Chasm's depths and not coming back out. This put the crew on edge, so Yuehui put in a commission at the Adventurers' Guild to put their fears to rest (and ensure their Mining Permit is not wasted). The Traveler ends up taking and resolving the commission, allowing his crew to get back to work.
