Profile[]
He said that he would come pick me up and that we'd go watch the snow together. But the time we arranged has come and gone, and he isn't here yet...—Joel, Lost in the Snow
Prior to the game's events, Joserf set off to Dragonspine and left his son Joel at the Adventurer Camp. He promised to Joel that he would return and take him to watch snow together, but the day they arranged for it to happen came and Joserf did not come. Joel, worried and stuck at the camp, asks the Traveler to help him look for his father.
The Traveler's search was unsuccessful and the only trace of Joserf were his written records, the supplies he abandoned, and the presence of a bowl with which he fed several snow foxes. Near the foxes, the Traveler found a buried pit containing a complete set of 3 ★ Adventurer Artifacts, except for the Adventurer's Pocket Watch. At the end of the cave, there were a group of Hilichurls and a backpack containing Vol.6 of The Boar Princess at the bottom of the mountain, which indicated that Joserf had fallen from the mountain and had been attacked. Although the Traveler doubted Joserf's survival, they tried to sugarcoat the situation after returning to Joel.[2]
During the Adventurers' Guild training camp, Reckless Pallad separated from the group to pursue his personal motivations, only to lose his footing and fall down the mountain. He was discovered by Joserf, who brought him to shelter. According to Joserf, he woke up and found himself covered in blood, lost most of his memories by the time he met Pallad, attributing it to head trauma. Joserf had forgotten virtually everything about himself, including his identity and the reason why he was on Dragonspine, but apparently retained his hunting skills and was able to survive alone as a result. Pallad convinced Joserf to follow him to the Adventurer Camp, where they ran into Joel. After Joel recognized him, Joserf began recalling vague details about his past.[3][4]
While attending the training camp send-off, the Traveler and Paimon meet Joserf. They are surprised by his survival and discover that he has no memories of The Boar Princess or feeding the foxes, but are nonetheless glad to see father and son reunited.[3] Afterwards, Joel and Joserf can be found together in the Adventurers' Camp, where they plan on building a fox-shaped snowman.

Appearance[]
Joserf and his son look so alike that the Traveler describes him as a "gigantic version of Joel." They share the same brown hair, blue eyes, and even the color scheme of their clothes.

Dialogue[]

(After completing A Secret Born From Ashes or Snowy Silhouette: Reunion)
Joserf: Hello there, we meet again. I remember you.
 How have you been doing lately?
Joserf: I've been fine, thanks for your concern. That said, my memory is still somewhat foggy. I wonder when it'll all come back to me...
Joserf: Joel's been trying very hard to help me recover those memories. When I look at him, I just think that there's more I could be doing as well.
 He's happy just having you back.
Joserf: That's true, that's true. And I'd be happy accompanying him to do anything, so long as it makes him happy.
Joserf: I agreed to go build a fox snowman with him. I'm not sure why, but it gives me this warm and familiar feeling...
Joserf: Still, Dragonspine is a very dangerous place. I'll make sure to keep an eye on Joel while we're here...
 Goodbye.
Joserf: Take care, and thanks again for your help!

Dragonspine Notes[]

(Snow-Covered Path campsite)
Neatly-Written Note: So far, so smooth. The weather is fine, supplies are plentiful, and the monsters have been on their best behavior...
Neatly-Written Note: I also discovered a Volume 6 of "The Boar Princess" in my backpack. Joel must've sneaked it in there. That cheeky kid...
Neatly-Written Note: Still, this book is above a brave Boar Princess and her journey up a snowy mountain with her companions... Well, I'm heading up a snowy mountain myself, and considering how well everything's gone so far... Who knows? Maybe this book is bringing me good luck. Thank you, Joel.
Neatly-Written Note: Anyway, I shall be heading off to the next campsite to resupply and record my progress, and then I'll head down the mountain. Joel is waiting for me, after all.

(Western slope campsite)
Neatly-Written Note: Nothing untoward happened on the way here. The weather remains fine indeed. It seems that my luck has turned at last.
Neatly-Written Note: Perhaps I can make a run for the summit after all...
Neatly-Written Note: I'll just give it a little go. If anything happens, I'll turn back right away.

(Campsite near the summit)
Scribbled Note: The snowstorm from the summit came too quickly. I barely had enough time to duck into this cave. I lost half my supplies in the chaos, too...
Scribbled Note: I don't know why, either, but the rocks above the cave collapsed suddenly, sealing the entrance with the falling gravel. This is very bad...
Scribbled Note: But... I believe that there's another way out for me. The other end of this cave is a cliff, yes, but there's nothing below but thick snow. If I try climbing a certain distance down and then jumping the rest of the way...
Scribbled Note: My supplies won't last more than a few more days. I have to act soon...
Scribbled Note: I promised Joel that I'd take him to see the snow. I won't break that promise.
Scribbled Note: Oh, yes. If anyone sees these notes, please put some food into that feeding bowl for those foxes.
Scribbled Note: They kept me company the entire time I was trapped in here. If I get the chance, I'd love to bring Joel back here to see them...

Trivia[]
Three major interpretations have arisen regarding Joserf's reappearance:
The real Joserf miraculously survived, perhaps with the help of the emergency rations the Traveler places during the Commission Emergency Supplies. The author's situation referred to in the Thank-You Letter is very similar to Joserf's, and the writing style also resembles the notes he left during Lost in the Snow. Joserf also notes that the prospect of building a fox snowman with Joel gives him a "warm and familiar feeling," although if Joserf is an impostor, this could easily be taken as "Joserf" adapting after hearing about the foxes from Paimon immediately beforehand.
Others believe that given Joserf's circumstances — in which he had to survive at least several days while lost and alone, without supplies, having allegedly suffered head trauma, severe blood loss, and leg injuries — the real Joserf's survival is unlikely. Instead, one of the two impostors introduced during Shadows Amidst Snowstorms has taken on his appearance:
Primordial Albedo's ultimate fate was left ambiguous at the end of Act III, and it is also unclear whether the exchange between the Traveler and Albedo about the impostor that Albedo "took out" was about Fellflower Albedo, who was run through with a sword and then defeated, or Primordial Albedo, who Albedo said already failed in his plans. As Albedo learned about the situation with Joel and his missing father during Act I, and Primordial Albedo can change his appearance with alchemy, Albedo convinced Primordial Albedo to assume Joserf's identity so that the conflict between Rhinedottir's creations is resolved while also giving Joel a resolution to his father's disappearance. Proponents of this theory interpret Albedo's conversation at the end of Act III to be a metaphor for Primordial Albedo's current situation.
While the Fellflower was defeated in Act II, creatures mutated by Durin's blood have extraordinary properties, and so it may have survived, switching to a different target of mimicry, either because of its unstable mutation as noted by the Traveler in Act II or because its original purpose of imitating Albedo is no longer needed. Those who follow this interpretation focus on how it came into contact with Joel while disguised as Albedo during Act I, and the Traveler's dialogue option about how Joserf looks like a "gigantic version of Joel."
For players who did not complete Shadows Amidst Snowstorms, Joserf instead returns upon completion of Snowy Silhouette: Hope and Snowy Silhouette: Reunion. The dialogue in those quests indicates that the events of Shadows Amidst Snowstorms still took place in some way without the Traveler. However, as the events did not happen identically in this version of the search and reunion, the existence of this version of events provides neither anything for nor anything against the theories above.
