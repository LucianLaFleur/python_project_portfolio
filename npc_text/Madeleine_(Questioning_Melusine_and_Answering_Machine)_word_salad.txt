Profile[]
Madeleine is the wife of Baulande, having a child named Kevin with him. Both were members of the Fatui, though Madeleine took the time to help raise Kevin.
When Sir Arthur was stolen from The Steambird, the Traveler, Paimon, Talochard and "Curve" were directed to Rocher, though Rocher's dog Baulande! Lombroso! instead directed them to Madeleine and Kevin. Further investigation reveals that Bauland was helping the Fatui with finding Mosso Lombroso's workshop in the hopes of an early retirement if he was successful in his mission. She took their arrival as a bad sign and wants Bauland to abort the mission to hide and live peacefully, though he was initially insistent on completing it. Eventually, she convinces him to abandon it, and as a result of directly disobeying a Lord Harbinger's orders, the three went into hiding.
