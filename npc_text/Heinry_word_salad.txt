Dialogue[]

Heinry: And just what flavour should the next Fonta product be...?
 I'm thirsty...
Heinry: If you're thirsty, drink Fonta! Take this bottle, please, and enjoy its refreshing taste!
Heinry: Remember: Refreshing Fonta, a Font of Refreshment!
(Obtain  Fonta ×1)
(Becomes available after beginning Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble)
 Can I drink Fonta here?
(Before completing Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble)

Heinry: Of course! Check out this Motorized Autonomous Fonta Vending Machine. If you're a member of the Fontaine Research Institute, you can buy a refreshing original flavor Fonta from it with your Mora.
Heinry: However, if you're not a member of the institute, you won't be able to use this machine.
(After completing Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble)

Heinry: Of course! Check out this Motorized Autonomous Fonta Vending Machine, Honorary Senior Researcher!
Heinry: As long as you're a member of the Fontaine Research Institute, you can buy a refreshing original flavor Fonta here with your Mora.
Heinry: But, uh... You'll need to wait for me to fix it.
(After completing Both Brains and Brawn)

Heinry: Of course! Check out this Motorized Autonomous Fonta Vending Machine, Honorary Senior Researcher!
Heinry: As long as you're a member of the Fontaine Research Institute, you can buy a refreshing original flavor Fonta here with your Mora.
Heinry: Huh? That cup of yours... Haha. If you've got that cup then you can help yourself to unlimited Fonta. Go on, drink up! Drink to your heart's content!
 Original flavor?
Heinry: Yes. I'm working on different flavors, each with its own unique name... But I felt the original flavor of Fonta should have its own special name too.
Heinry: After a full and frank discussion, I decided to call it Fonta: Original. What do you think? Simple, yet powerful, right?
 You invented Fonta?
Heinry: Huh? You honestly don't know who I am? Hahaha, okay, then allow me to introduce myself.
Heinry: My name is Heinry, and I am a researcher at the Fontaine Research Institute, and one of the developers of Fonta. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Heinry: However, though I say I am a "Fontaine Research Institute researcher," I have not participated in any research for some time, and have been focused on the Fonta business itself, outside of the Institute.
Heinry: This time, I am coming as an interim representative of Fonta Co., and wish to discuss the rebuilding of the Institute.
Heinry: But Mr. Choiseul seemed somewhat reluctant when we started talking about funding. I don't know what he's worried about...
 Who are you talking to?
Heinry: This Gardemek. It's this Motorized Autonomous Fonta Vending machine's bodyguard.
Heinry: Umm... Although it's not operational at the moment due to some minor technical issues. But these kind of things get fixed very quickly here at the Institute.
 See you
Heinry: Bye. And remember to drink Fonta!
