Dialogue[]

Sonny: ...You're right, dear Luca. I do hope that such a regrettable incident won't happen again.
Luca: ...
Sonny: Why, if it isn't our old friend! What a coincidence, bumping into you! How have you been?
 About Virgil...
Sonny: Right, are you interested in fishing? In Fontaine, there are all sorts of fish that make fishing truly rewarding. Am I right, my dear Luca?
Luca: ...
Sonny: *sigh* Shame, he seems to have his own more... tedious pursuits. Still, I am certain that you understand. Am I right, my dear (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
Sonny: Here's some fresh catch. Please take it. I am sorry to interrupt you, it's just that I really wanted to share this... novel fun of exercising with you.
(Obtain  Fish ×4)
 How've been things for you?
Sonny: I hope you're right! While there's always something unpleasant to deal with, as we say in Fontaine, "that's life."
Sonny: Don't you think so, dear Luca?
Luca: Life? Hmph!
Sonny: You see? Luca's wit is as electrifying as ever. I'm overjoyed to hear him answer your question so concisely.
 See you.
Sonny: Truly, this was a wonderful encounter for a beautiful day. Goodbye, dear friend.
Luca: See you.

Beware of them — they each have their own agenda, and they're not all friendly like us. If you ever find yourself in a tight spot, you can always ask Mr. Tetreaux at the bar for help. Unless you're dealing with someone who isn't in the mood to sit down and have a conversation, in which case... White Glove will sort things out. You can count on him.
Trivia[]
Sonny is inspired by Sonny Corleone from the epic crime film The Godfather.
