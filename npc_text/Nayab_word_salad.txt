Dialogue[]

Nayab: I must... I must win. Even just once.
 And you are...
Nayab: If we're talking careers, I'm a matra of the Akademiya. You don't have to be nervous. It's not my working hours now.
Nayab: Under the strict supervision of the General Mahamatra, the spreading of banned knowledge and academic corruption in the Akademiya has decreased significantly. Thanks to Lord Cyno, us subordinates' vacations have also become more frequent.
Nayab: Many students often have meals together in this café, but most of their conversations are just regular chats.
Nayab: Although the matra are in charge of many things, they are not responsible for collecting students' evaluations and opinions about their mentors.
Nayab: So right now, I am just an ordinary person of Sumeru who is enjoying coffee while studying card strategies.
 Win what?
Nayab: Don't you know? It's Genius Invokation TCG, the greatest craze in all of Sumeru, maybe even in all of Teyvat!
Nayab: The varied decks, the unpredictable turns... It is all so fascinating.
Nayab: That's how all my vacation was just somehow spent playing cards, or studying how to play.
 Interesting.
Nayab: You think so, too? Then you should come to Puspa Café more often. It has people fighting tooth and nail every day!
Nayab: I mean fighting in Genius Invokation TCG, of course. If someone started an actual fight, the acting manager would flip out before I did.
Nayab: Say, are you free now? I want to show you the new deck I built, and maybe you can help me figure out how I can win with it?
(Obtain  Hero's Wit ×2)
 See you.
Nayab: Goodbye, I already have an idea...
