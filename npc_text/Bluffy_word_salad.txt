 Why hasn't it...

Quote[]

Bluffy: Ah, yes, hello. Do you need something?
Bluffy: Oh, right, I'm still on the clock... Apologies, what might you require, dear guest?
 What's on your mind?
Bluffy: I was just spacing out for a moment. Thank you for your concern.
Bluffy: Honestly, I have another reason for doing this job... I'm looking for one of those meetings you read about in books — a romantic coincidence.
Bluffy: A homely maid suddenly whisked off her feet by a dashing young rogue, making a secret promise by the Bishui River... Ahh...
Bluffy: Perhaps it's the slow business here, or it's just my luck, but it seems that such things could never happen to me.
Bluffy: *sigh* I was wondering if I should give up and find someone familiar to settle down with. I can't just keep waiting like this forever...
 Good Luck. See you.
Bluffy: You too. If there's anything else you need, please feel free to ask.
