Profile[]
Haypasia is a researcher of the Rtawahist Darshan.[2] She is considered a genius in the Akademiya thanks to her successful attempts at connecting to Irminsul using Spirit Borneol after only three years of training.
When the Traveler first arrived in Sumeru, they ran into Haypasia and asked her for directions, although due to her training, she promptly ignored them to begin her research. This caused the Traveler to faint when they caught up to her, where they had a vision of Irminsul. After Haypasia's Dusk Bird returned, Tighnari had the Traveler bring some rations to her, where she regained consciousness and apologized for ignoring them earlier before resuming her research.
Haypasia would eventually make contact with a divine being, and came to believe that she had successfully linked her mind to Irminsul. She began exhibiting unusual behavior, which caused Tighnari to grow suspicious and bring her to Pardis Dhyai for further evaluation. There, she ran into the Traveler again, and Haypasia offered to show them what she saw. However, what she had seen were the memories and thoughts of Scaramouche, who was in the process of achieving godhood. Upon realizing that she had lost her sanity, she walked off. Scaramouche saw her as his first follower due to the fact that she had seen his past.
Haypasia remained in Tighnari's care until Irminsul was fully restored. After recovering, she continued her training in the forest.[3]

Appearance[]
Haypasia has short, light green hair that is braided from the top, and wears one of the basic Sumeru Akademiya uniforms seen on many other prestigious members of the Akademiya, as well as a pair of glasses.
