Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available prior to completing Scenes from Life in Meropide: Treat the Symptoms


Lechlade: Take my advice, kid. Stay away from those yellow-green stones! The further away, the better!
 And you are?
Lechlade: I'm just an old nobody...
 About the yellow-green stones...
Lechlade: Those stones are evil! They bring disaster to the greedy and misfortune to the ignorant...
 See you.
Lechlade: So trust me and stay as far away from them as you can!

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Scenes from Life in Meropide: Treat the Symptoms


Lechlade: Health is something we only truly value after we've lost it...
 How have you been?
Lechlade: Dr. Arderne's medicine really worked. My headache is gone and I feel wide awake. It makes me think of the days I was able to help people like that...
Lechlade: *Sigh* It's all my fault. You need to look after yourself, and take any symptom seriously, even the smallest ones...
 About the yellow-green stones...
Lechlade: Those stones are bad news!
Lechlade: Cutting off the road to them isn't enough! We need to destroy them all... They can't be allowed to exist.
 See you.
Lechlade: Goodbye. And remember to stay away from those yellow-green stones! The further away the better!
