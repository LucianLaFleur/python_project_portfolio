Judar and Morghi were sent by the Akademiya to kidnap the Village Keepers of Aaru Village with the aid of Rahman's Eremite faction. After realizing the truth about King Deshret's resurrection, Rahman later turns them in to be punished by Dehya, Alhaitham, Cyno, and others. When Judar sees Cyno, he cowers in fear, afraid of being torn into pieces, and they reveal the Sages' plan to create a new god out of Scaramouche.[2]
Judar and Morghi later assist Alhaitham by helping to repair the Canned Knowledge extraction devices as part of the plan to reenter Sumeru City and rescue Nahida. After Alhaitham has the Traveler use the devices to record a Canned Knowledge Capsule, he takes the two researchers to work on modifications to the Akasha System.[3]
