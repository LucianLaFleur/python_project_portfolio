Event Dialogue[]
Hues of the Violet Garden[]

(Talk to Ootomo or Lenne after completing The Moon and Stars Inscribe)
Lenne: Ah, when I think that this journey in Inazuma must end and that we shall not read each other poems again like this, I cannot help but feel a little sad.
Ootomo: Though they say that "all feasts must someday end," it is inevitable that we shall feel sadness. Lenne, shall we correspond via letters in the future?
Lenne: That would be wonderful!

Of Ballads and Brews[]

Lenne: Weinlesefest is the best festival for bards!
Lenne: Sampling fine wines while singing your heart out. This is the life of a bard, and that's how it's supposed to be.
Lenne: It's the perfect festival for getting those creative juices flowing. I really hope my poet friends from Inazuma can come and check it out as well.
