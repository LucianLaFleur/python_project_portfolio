Profile[]
While appearing to be uncaring and oblivious to her surroundings no matter the situation, Columbina is implied to be extremely dangerous as both Tartaglia and Wanderer warn the Traveler to be wary around her if they ever meet each other.[5][6] On the other hand, Arlecchino is less wary of her, stating that if she was to properly answer a question, it could be entirely unpredictable, but any of her answers would be interesting in general.[7] Being the third of the Fatui Harbingers, she also has power rivaling that of the gods.[8]

Appearance[]
Columbina was a pale young woman with long black hair with dark pink highlights and fades magenta. She has several white feathers are on the back of her head, that was reminiscent in design of the wings of a dove. She has white X-shaped laces covering her eyes, her eyes were also always closed. She also wears a double-breasted white overcoat with grey lapels and a collar of black fur in the Lazzo trailer.

Pose her a question, and the answer you receive will be entirely unpredictable, if she sees fit to give a proper answer at all. Regardless, any answer you do receive is sure to be an interesting one.TartagliaAbout Damselette Media:VO_Tartaglia About Damselette.ogg Media:VO ZH_Tartaglia About Damselette.ogg Media:VO JA_Tartaglia About Damselette.ogg Media:VO KO_Tartaglia About Damselette.ogg The Fatui Harbingers are ranked by strength, and I have no idea why that girl is No. 3. I'd test my skills with every Harbinger who ranks above me if I had the chance, but when it comes to her... something just doesn't feel right. Anyway, you should be careful around her.WandererAbout Damselette Media:VO_Wanderer About Damselette.ogg Media:VO ZH_Wanderer About Damselette.ogg Media:VO JA_Wanderer About Damselette.ogg Media:VO KO_Wanderer About Damselette.ogg Let me ask: what should you do if you were to encounter a "damsel" who is oblivious and innocent at any given time, and unconcerned and unfeeling in any given situation? If it were me, I could at least challenge her to a fight. But if it were you... with your conscience, I would stay away from her.
Trivia[]
In commedia dell'arte, a type of Italian theater, Columbina (Italian: Colombina "Little Dove") is a female servant who is often the "only functional intellect on the stage" as she does her best to get the Innamorati together.
The melody Columbina sings in A Winter Night's Lazzo was a rendition of the melodies of Chrysalis Suspirii and Saltatio Favillae, both of which are played during the battle with Signora in Narukami Island: Tenshukaku.
Her headpiece mimics that of an angel's wings, specifically a seraph's.
The pattern on her face covering and headband are similar in appearance to the pattern on the bottom of a Seelie Court.
