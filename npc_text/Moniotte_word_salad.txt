 Lady Furina...
Media:VO Moniotte 01.ogg "Who else deserves to take the stage more than Lady Furina!"

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available prior to completing Masquerade of the Guilty.


Moniotte: I wonder where I might purchase an ornament similar to Lady Furina's watch...?
 What sort of watch is that?
Moniotte: The famous Lady of the Lake's Tear, of course!
Moniotte: It's exquisite and small enough to be set upon a ring. That is why it was given that name by Lady Furina herself.
Moniotte: As her most ardent follower, perhaps I might shorten the distance between myself and my god by finding an accessory as much like it as possible.
Moniotte: Ah, our beautiful Hydro Archon... her superb makeup, her gentle voice, her agile dance steps... Are they not worthy of a greater, more luxurious stage...?
 I'm not very sure where you'd find one...
Moniotte: Not to worry. This was never going to be easy anyway — but I shall not give up!

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing "The Little Oceanid".


Moniotte: Have you heard? Lady Furina performed again! It's wonderful... I thought I'd never get the chance to see my beloved Archon again...
 Tell me about Lady Furina...
Moniotte: Although many have stopped referring to her as a deity, to me, Lady Furina will always be divine whenever she takes the stage.
Moniotte: Oh, when I heard that Lady Furina was to leave the opera house forever, I was so sad I shut myself away and never wanted to leave the house again...
Moniotte: But I knew that she, who will always be divine in my heart, would not be defeated by such a trivial setback! Ah, our beautiful Lady Furina... I can finally see you on the stage once more!
Moniotte: Her superb makeup, her gentle voice, her agile dance steps... Are they not worthy of a greater, more luxurious stage...?
 I'm happy for you.
Moniotte: No, be happy for Lady Furina! And do not fail to support her new undertaking!
