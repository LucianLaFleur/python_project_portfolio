Profile[]
In A Child's Secret, Silio is seen drinking with Kaeya, Diluc, and Reckless Pallad. He drinks to lift his own burdens away, and says that if he ever had an imaginary friend, it'd be a beer mug.[1]

Appearance[]
Silio is a man of average height and build with medium-length chestnut hair. His hair is kept in a low, thin ponytail while his messy bangs are swept to the left side of his face, nearly covering his eye. His eyes are almond-shaped and teal, framed by a pair of bold eyebrows. His attire is of varying shades of brown, with a dark chocolate tee and knee-length pants, and a hazel vest with an assortment of strings.
