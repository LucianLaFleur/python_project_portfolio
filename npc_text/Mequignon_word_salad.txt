Dialogue[]

Mequignon: Welcome to Bertin's House of Curiosities.
 What do you sell here? (Before reaching Fountain of Lucine Level 50)
Mequignon: I apologize, but I haven't encountered anything that catches my fancy lately. Come again later, if you please.
 What do you sell here? (After reaching Fountain of Lucine Level 50)
Mequignon: Please, take your pick. I do hope something catches your eye.
(Opens Souvenir Shop)
 You're a collector?
Mequignon: Not exactly. I'm actually a clothes designer.
Mequignon: If you ask someone in Fontaine about tailoring recommendations, there's a good chance that you'd either hear my name...
Mequignon: ...Or that of "Chiori"...
 Is collecting a hobby of yours?
Mequignon: Yes, it's also a way of seeking design inspiration.
Mequignon: I believe that "only those that are completely forgotten can become something that is brand-new."
Mequignon: Fashion is a loop of becoming outdated and then coming back in trend. If you're interested, take this. It's no longer useful to me anyway.
(Obtain 4★  Golden Bird's Shedding)
 Chiori?
Mequignon: I refer to Chioriya Boutique's Chiori, a designer from Inazuma.
Mequignon: Her tastes... aren't bad, but we've got differences in ideas. She's also a rather picky character — even her works do not satisfy her.
Mequignon: The last time I spoke to her of a design flaw in her work, not only did she not get angry, but she even picked at her own work more vehemently than I. I didn't dare put a word in lengthwise...
 I'll pass for now.
Mequignon: Sure. Come again next time.

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
Mequignon's name may be a reference to Marie-Marguerite Méquignon, the mother of French fashion designer Rose Bertin; who was best-known as Queen Marie Antoinette's dressmaker and milliner.
