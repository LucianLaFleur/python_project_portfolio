Profile[]
Wagner is the main blacksmith in Mondstadt. He owns a blacksmith named after his apprentice, Schulz, whom he has lost a bet with over who could drink the most. Wagner ended up losing and was forced to change the business name as a result. Sometime later, Lawrence's father, a merchant from Fontaine, had a drinking contest with Wagner. Not knowing about the infamy of the Lawrence Clan at the time, Lawrence's father would have to call his son Lawrence. Fortunately, Wagner was able to win; if he had lost, then he would have had to name his prized weapon "Pinky the Rabbit".[3]
Rumor has it that when Noelle was studying the blade, she nearly sent Wagner — who prided himself in his forging skills — into despairing seclusion. In all, he forged over ten different swords with different alloy compositions for her, but all would lose their edge after a few uses. At first, Wagner thought Noelle unskilled, but eventually found that the problem was more foundational: due to her superhuman strength, the swords just weren't strong enough.
Putting his reputation on the line, Wagner finally custom-made Noelle a sturdy and heavy claymore that was further reinforced by her affinity for Geo. Only then was her weapon issue (barely) solved.[4]

Dialogue[]

(During Dragon Storm)
Wagner: What? Speak up, I can't hear you.
 Aren't you going to find shelter?
Wagner: Shelter? It'd take a much bigger storm than this to keep me away from my blacksmith's...
Wagner: The wrought iron here spends all day getting hammered into shape.
Wagner: People, on the other hand, don't get that chance as often — so make the most of it.
(Normal dialogue)
Wagner: Can I help you?
 What do you have to sell?
Wagner: Take your pick. You'll find no second-rate items at Wagner's.
 I'd like something made.
(If nothing has been forged)

Wagner: Did you bring the materials? Let me have a look.
(If something has been forged but not collected yet)

Wagner: That reminds me — your order from last time is ready. Is that what you wanted, or is this a new request?

(If the player loses the match)

Wagner: What? You look surprised. Never seen a blacksmith play cards before?
(If the player wins the match)

Wagner: Okay, I've got other things to do...
 Any tips on finding ore in Mondstadt?
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Wagner knows; Version 1)

Wagner: You're asking me where to find more ore? Hmph. Looking for it yourself would be far too much trouble, I take it...
Wagner: Luckily for you, I did in fact come across some odd-looking Crystal Ore recently. It's called Magical Crystal Ore and it's a lot more powerful than your regular one.
Wagner: I, for one, don't have the skill to deal with that kind of power. It could be that it takes more than the work of a smith to process that kind of thing.
Wagner: ...I've marked a few locations of Magical Crystal Ore on your map. Go fetch some and see what you make of it.
Wagner: You must let me know if you figure out how to make use of it... I can't stand being shown up as a blacksmith by a bunch of stupid rocks.
(Rich Ore Reserves marked on the map)
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Wagner knows; Version 2)

Wagner: You're asking me where to find more ore? Hmph. Looking for it yourself would be far too much trouble, I take it...
Wagner: Luckily for you, I do know a few spots, having been in the trade this long. Never had the time to check them out myself is all.
Wagner: Tell you what, I'll mark out the locations for you — just make sure you come to me when you need any forging done, got it? Give me your map...
Wagner: ...Right, done. Crystal Ore deposits all marked out for you. Don't make me regret telling you.
(Rich Ore Reserves marked on the map)
(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Wagner knows)

Wagner: Nope.
Wagner: Not if you've already exhausted the sources I told you about.
Wagner: If you're that desperate for more, I'm sorry but that's your problem. We can discuss it another time, but I'm busy right now.
 About Stormterror...
(After completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
Wagner: There's nothing to be said. Dragon or no dragon, I'll be here.
Wagner: As long as there's life in me, the fires of Wagner's smithy will not go out.
Wagner: Smithing is not dependent on brute strength. You need the sweat on your brow from constant hard work, and perseverance stronger thhan the metals we forge!
Wagner: The tempest is precisely the time to practice perseverance. If one were to be terrified at a little wind, then forging a respectable weapon is simply out of the question!
 I'd like to ask about something.
Wagner: Well, spit it out already.
 How good is this smithy?
Wagner: Stupid question. If you really want to know, buy something.
Wagner: Talk is cheap. Pick up a blade and you'll soon know.
Wagner: If even this much eludes you, then you've got a long road ahead of you, runt.
 Tell me about yourself.
Wagner: There are no other qualified blacksmiths here, except for me and my apprentice, Schulz.
Wagner: I can tell you from experience that hard work is all there is to the craft! Many other "blacksmiths" out there are just out to make a quick mora!
Wagner: Family? Inheritance? Meaningless! I only need an apprentice to pass on my skills.
 Goodbye.
Wagner: If there's nothing else, get going. I'm busy.
