  Mentioned Characters 




Takamine the Mistsplitter (Japanese: 霧切高嶺 Kirigiri Takamine),[Note 1] nicknamed "Konbumaru" (Japanese: 昆布丸), was a famous martial artist in Inazuma who lived five hundred years ago.[1][Note 2]
He was Asase Hibiki's love interest, although he married a high-ranking samurai's daughter after becoming the Raiden Shogun's Hatamoto.[2] Despite later entrusting his bow to Hibiki and wagering his "future" on it, they would never come to see this future — in battle against the dark forces during the cataclysm, Takamine was overwhelmed and disappeared.[1][3]
Takamine was the wielder of Mistsplitter Reforged and Thundering Pulse.

Story[]
In Takamine's youth, he was wandering around Mt. Yougou when he came across the Great Tengu Reizenbou and made a wager with her. The contest ended in a draw with three wins and three losses; Takamine temporarily became the Tengu's servant in exchange for gaining ownership over Thundering Pulse, a bow gifted by the Raiden Shogun.[4] He followed her to the Grand Narukami Shrine where the Kitsune Saiguu, the subject of the great Tengu's protection,[3][5] resided, and there he met The Yougou Three, including Hibiki. Takamine and Hibiki grew close, a matter which the Kitsune Saiguu enjoyed teasing her over.[3]
During his servitude to the Tengu, he learned some of her archery and swordplay. Despite priding himself in both fields, he was much more renowned for his skill with his blade. Finding it a shame that his Tengu archery was going to waste, he taught it to Hibiki.[1][2][4]
After his period of servitude ended, Takamine gained Baal's recognition thanks to a recommendation letter from his master[4] and became a Hatamoto. Likely as a result of his station, Takamine later married a high-ranking samurai's daughter. Despite this, he hadn't lost his gambling and wandering habits, which Hibiki scolded him for.[2]

The Cataclysm and Death[]
When the cataclysm struck, Takamine was among those who accompanied Baal on her campaign to the abyss to against the dark forces.[1][4] Chiyo of the Mikoshi Clan, Baal's Lieutenant, also participated.[2][Note 3] The Kitsune Saiguu also fell victim to the dark disaster,[3][5][6] although it is unclear whether she personally participated in the campaign.
During the conflict, Takamine was separated from the rest and fought against the dark forces alone. Because he left Thundering Pulse with Hibiki as his wager for his successful return, he had only his Mistsplitter to rely on in battle. After the sword broke, he was overwhelmed and failed to resurface even after the events of the cataclysm ended. Many years later, Takamine finally emerged from the abyss, only to be pierced and presumably killed by Hibiki's arrows upon reuniting with her.[4] It appears that she viewed her act as "saving" him.[7] It was later revealed by Yae Miko that what returned to Inazuma was not Takamine himself, but the darkened remains of his soul and it was necessary to wipe him out to protect Inazuma.[8]

Legacy[]
Takamine is still remembered in a popular Inazuman folk song: "Arataki of the Front Gate, Iwakura the Successor, Kitain the Serpent, Takamine the Mistsplitter."
After Hibiki returned to Asase Shrine, she often spoke fondly of Takamine to Neko, although she usually referred to him as "Konbumaru." As a result, Neko interpreted the name to have a positive connotation, and has named a cat "Konbumaru" once per generation ever since.[9]
During Ako Domeki's rebellion against the Shogunate, his mannerisms and manner of speech reminded Hibiki of Takamine, so she offered him her assistance. Even though he rejected her assistance, she decided to use the "true 'magic'" she learned from the Yougou Tengu to undo the seal on the Thunder Manifestation and use it to wreak havoc on the Shogunate fleet to aid his cause and protect him.[10]

Trivia[]
Takamine's nickname, Konbumaru (Japanese: 昆布丸), is comprised of 昆布 konbu, "kelp" + 丸 maru (a suffix for names).
When Harunosuke refers to "Mr. Takamine" in the Chinese and Japanese versions, he uses the honorific "Uncle" (Chinese: 大叔 dàshū; Japanese: おじさん oji-san),[11] after he became a servant of the Great Tengu in exchange for ownership of Thundering Pulse.[4] indicating that Takamine was probably almost a generation older than Harunosuke.
Notes[]

↑ According to Hibiki's narration in Hamayumi, Takamine was his surname. He has not been referred to by his first name.

↑ A Pirate's Diary on Nazuchi Beach, written by present-day pirates, states that Ako Domeki lived five hundred years ago. In Hamayumi, which is set some time after Takamine's disappearance/death, Hibiki offers Domeki her assistance. As a result, Takamine lived around that same time period.

↑ Weapon Ascension Material: Mask of the One-Horned and Mask of the KijinHe [Torachiyo] was once a beloved lieutenant of the Shogun, and he followed her into the dark abyssal realms to repel the defiled ones [...]; Mask of the Kijin reveals that the story of "Torachiyo" is actually Chiyo's story, distorted over time.
