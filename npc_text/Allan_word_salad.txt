Dialogue[]

Allan: Hi. If you're looking for a hunting partner, you'd be better off picking someone else...
 Who are you?
Allan: Oh, I'm Allan. I'm a hunter... in the making.
Allan: I'm trying my best to learn the tricks of the trade from Draff.
 Could you tell us about hunting techniques?
Allan: Draff is very experienced, and he's taught me a lot, like how to read the wind direction to prevent our prey from catching our scent.
Allan: He could even tell at a glance that the bow I had been using was no longer suited to my current skills. He then crafted a new one for me with his own hands...
Allan: Thanks for chatting with me. Allow me to give you my old bow, since I longer use it.
(Obtain  Seasoned Hunter's Bow ×1)
 You seem a bit worse for wear.
Allan: Oh I'm fine.. It's just, I got a bit lost yesterday when I was out hunting...
Allan: I almost wound up in a hilichurl camp. Fortunately I managed to escape...
 Sounds dangerous.
Allan: I'm lucky made it back safe and sound. But once again, I came back empty-handed...
Allan: But... *sigh* Never mind. It is what it is.
 Sounds rough.
Allan: I'm alright, really. I just always end up getting rescued by Outrider Amber...
Allan: It's so embarrassing.
Allan: She's quite the capable one. Well, she is a Vision bearer after all.
 Goodbye.
Allan: See you.

Event Dialogue[]
Unreconciled Stars[]

Allan: I can't thank you enough for all of your help dealing with the meteorites.
Allan: But I still can't stop wondering... Where did they come from?

Invitation of Windblume[]

Allan: Foxes really are too difficult to catch. Just how exactly did the elders manage it...
 About the foxes...
Allan: Oh! As Springvale hunters, this is one of our customs.
Allan: Every Windblume festival, young hunters like me go to Wolvendom to catch foxes.
Allan: When we catch one, we place a wreath of flowers on its head and release it. It's a prayer for finding love in the year ahead...
Allan: Of course, only eligible young hunters like myself participate. Hunters that have already tied the knot, like Draff for example, they're not allowed to take part.
 Did you catch a fox?
Allan: *sigh* Not even close. Foxes are so hard to catch.
Allan: I didn't catch one last Windblume Festival either. In fact, I nearly injured myself. I remember swearing that this time would be different...
Allan: ...and yet, low [sic] and behold, I've been outfoxed again. All I caught were a couple of squirrels.
Allan: That said... I wonder if Miss Sucrose could use her bio-alchemy to change squirrels into foxes?
Allan: I bet she could, haha...
 So everyone that catches a fox will find love?
Allan: Uh... if you always participate, your chances will increase exponentially...
Allan: ...in that sense, you're bound to bump into the right person eventually...
Allan: ...ahem. Anyway, that's what Draff's always telling us.
 Who are you?
(Dialogue responses are the same as normal)
 See you.
Allan: Indeed, see you.

 Goodbye.
Allan: Alright, see you next time.

Of Ballads and Brews[]

Allan: I don't know if it's because his daughter is on break or what, but Draff has been extra jolly these days and is drinking even harder after work...
Allan: It's a good thing that young one has been helping out lately, or I wouldn't be able to stand up if I had to hunt all by myself.
