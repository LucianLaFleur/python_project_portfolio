 Should've brought more spices...
Media:VO Afsoon 01.ogg "Next time I'll bring more spices to sell."

Dialogue[]

Afsoon: Why can't he understand? It already takes so much time to enter and exit the port, and we just have to wait?
 What happened?
Afsoon: Don't even bring that up. I can't stand that captain. Every time he comes to unload his cargo, it takes several times longer than any other ship.
Afsoon: He keeps saying that tea is fragile cargo that must be handled delicately, and that it naturally takes more time.
Afsoon: If taking so much time is really on the up and up, then why did he feel the need to secretly hand out some tea to the port officials? Hmph...
Afsoon: Next time, I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind!
 And just how do you plan on doing that?
Afsoon: I... uh... I have to bring more spices!
Afsoon: He claims I don't understand tea, but what does he know about spices? We'll see whose goods sell better.
 B—Bye!
Afsoon: How can you reason with someone like that?
