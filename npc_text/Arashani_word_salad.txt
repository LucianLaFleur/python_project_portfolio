Arashani is an Aranara. In the past, it used to play with a human girl named Avin. When Avin lost the ability to walk and could not freely play outside of Sumeru City, Arashani thought she forgot about the Aranara. When Traveler, Yoimiya, and Avin meet another Aranara named Arapurva, the two spirits arrange a meeting between them and Avin in a dream version of Mawtiyima Forest.
