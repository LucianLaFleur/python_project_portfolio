Race[]
If the player talks to Dandy, there will be an option to Start time trial challenge, requiring use of your glider for three out of four of the challenge locations.
The player will need to complete 3 races per track to earn a common, exquisite, and precious chest. The challenge timer will decrease as the rewards increase after a successful run.
After earning the precious chest, the player cannot earn any more rewards at that location but will be able to redo the challenge to beat their best time.

 Let the challenge begin!

 Who are you?
Dandy: I am Dandy. I'm an adventurer specializing in mountaineering and other highly dangerous activities.
