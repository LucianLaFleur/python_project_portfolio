Profile[]
Masato is a merchant who was transporting goods when he was ambushed on Nazuchi Beach. The vagrants, far more aggressive than usual, expressed an intent to kill him, but a blue oni prevented them from doing so, despite the vagrants insisting he would seek help. After some arguing, Masato escaped and made his way to the Watatsumi Army camp on Yashiori Island.
Arataki Itto later contacted Masato as he had seen the oni up close and he explained his ordeal to them.
