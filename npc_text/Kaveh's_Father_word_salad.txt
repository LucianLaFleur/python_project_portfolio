Profile[]
Kaveh's father participated the Interdarshan Championship twenty years ago at Kaveh's urging but did not win. He grew depressed afterwards — for reasons heavily implied to be an encounter with Sachin's consciousness — and left for the desert. He died due to running into quicksand while traveling in the desert.[1]

Appearance[]
Based on Sachin's remarks, Kaveh closely resembles his father.[2] Faranak's illustration of him with his acquaintances, which Kaveh estimates was drawn over thirty years ago, depicts him with neatly styled medium-length blond hair that trails down his neck and a raised bang. Among his neatly styled hair, a small tuft of hair appears to protrude from the top of his bang.

Story[]
As a child, Kaveh's father taught an Aranara named Arakasyapa how to read and write in a human script.[3][4]
Kaveh's father was a member of the Rtawahist Darshan and worked for a time at the Sumeru Akademiya. Over thirty years ago, He met Faranak, who wasn't initially interested in him but changed her mind after he supported her through her artistic struggles despite not understanding her artistic vision. She chose him over all of her other potential suitors, and they eventually married, conceiving Kaveh over 20 years before Chapter III began.[5]
Kaveh developed an early interest in architectural design from the scholarly backgrounds of his parents, and they bought him block puzzles.[6]
Shortly before the Interdarshan Championship held twenty years ago, Kaveh saw posters for the event as well as the Diadem of Knowledge, leading him to mention the event and how much he liked the diadem's appearance to his father. In response, his father said, "Why don't I win it, so I can let you play with it for a few days?"[7]
Kaveh's father became a favorite to win the Interdarshan Championship, but he did not win.[6] It is implied that in the final round, he encountered the fragment of Sachin's consciousness stored in the Diadem of Knowledge and was negatively affected enough that Arakasyapa, who still remembered Kaveh's father and happened to be nearby, took the Diadem of Knowledge and hid it in a tree hollow.[Note 1] However, the damage had already been done, and Kaveh's father fell into depression.[3]
Upset by Sachin's research,[7] Kaveh's father requested to join an investigative research project in the desert and offered his assistance to the people of Aaru Village, teaching them and supplying them with what he could. He also ventured beyond Aaru Village in search of the Nagarjunites. At some point, he began to write a letter to Kaveh. Kaveh's father eventually ran into a caravan trapped in quicksand and saved many people at the cost of his own life. His unfinished letter to Kaveh was taken by Rishti's son in hopes of delivering it, but the letter was presumably taken and never delivered after Rishti's son was killed in a scuffle a few years later.[3][8]

Legacy[]
The death of Kaveh's father led Kaveh to carry massive guilt and lose the ability to put himself first and accept pure goodwill, persisting even to present day.[6]
He, along with Faranak, had a significant influence on Kaveh's interest in architecture from an early age, with them encouraging his interest by purchasing a sketchbook and building blocks for him to play with. He also entered the Interdarshan Championship to win the Diadem of Knowledge for Kaveh to play with after he expressed interest in it due to its shape, suggesting that he encouraged a young Kaveh's developing interest in aesthetics. Kaveh grew up to be an aesthete, and after completing his magnum opus, the Palace of Alcazarzaray, which combined architectural practicality and aesthetics, he rose to national prominence in Sumeru.[6]
Kaveh's father's financial and medical assistance to Aaru Village saved it in the long run, earning him a positive reputation among the village residents. However, because it has been twenty years since the incident, even those who remember his good deeds are slowly beginning to forget or no longer care about what he had done.

Trivia[]
Kaveh's father taught him how to make Fatteh when he was a child, which is what Kaveh derives his Specialty Dish The Endeavor from.
Kaveh and the Traveler find Faranak's drawing of him and three other male acquaintances during Wondrous Times in Kaveh's Hangout Event: Act I - The Pendulum of Weal and Woe. Two of them are heavily implied to be Tighnari and Alhaitham's fathers, with the rightmost man most likely being Cyrus, Cyno's adoptive father.
According to Faranak, he was already friends with the man who resembles Tighnari before the social gathering. Because she did not know anyone else at the gathering, it is unclear whether he was already familiar with Alhaitham's father or Cyrus, or if he remained friends with them afterward.
In Wondrous Times, Kaveh explains that he previously attempted to open his Faranak's diary using the names and birthdates of his fathers' parents, but was unsuccessful. The fact that he knows their birthdates implies that Kaveh has met his grandparents at some point, though what role they played in his life, particularly after the death of their son, is unexplained.
In a number of ways, Kaveh's father can be seen as a parallel to Sachin:
Kaveh's father was called an idealist in the past, while Sachin was a self-proclaimed idealist who became a nihilist as a result of the atrocities he witnessed in the desert.
Both he and Sachin had one child with their respective partners before their deaths, both coincidentally having sons over 20 years before Chapter III took place.
Both left their children 20 years ago to venture out into the desert for research purposes, where they would eventually end up living in Aaru Village and traveling with a caravan.
Both died as a result of their desert experiences, though Sachin committed suicide as a result of his despair over the state of the world, whereas Kaveh's father died while trying to save others from quicksand.
He and Sachin had very different relationships with their children, which resulted in their children perceiving them differently in the present; Sachin was emotionally neglectful to Jiwani and preferred his research over him, causing Jiwani to resent him and actively plot to harm him in order to secure his inheritance, whereas Kaveh had a mutually loving relationship with his father and as a result still thinks highly of him. He also still mourns his death 20 years later, even blaming himself for being the cause of it.
Even after traveling into the desert, Kaveh's father still cared about Kaveh and wrote him a letter that was later lost after his death, whereas Sachin shows no concern for Jiwani and does not even inform him of his death, let alone the fact that he lived on in the form of the fragment of his consciousness sealed inside the Diadem of Knowledge.

Notes[]

↑ "That Incident From Twenty Years Ago" indicates that after the final round, Arakasyapa hid the Diadem of Knowledge in a tree hole in order to protect the human who taught it how to read, who is suggested in The Contestant to be the same person who helped Aaru Village and died in quicksand. When the Curtains Close shows that the human spoken of in The Contestant is Kaveh's father, as deduced by both the Traveler and Alhaitham.According to Wiqas in Sachin's Article, the Diadem of Knowledge "carries a secret that no one knows"; the secret is likely related to the mental experience Kaveh had with Sachin's words and emotions due to the Diadem of Knowledge, as shown in To Claim the Crown, explained by Kaveh himself in The Arc of Intellect, and further supported by Kaveh's declaration in When the Curtains Close that with the diadem shattered, Sachin's words will never hurt anyone again. This makes it likely that Kaveh's father had the same experience as Kaveh.
