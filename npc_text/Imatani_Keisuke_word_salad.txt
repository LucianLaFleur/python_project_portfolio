Profile[]
Imatani Keisuke is part of the Tenryou Commission, though he feels regret over confiscating people's Visions and wonders if he is doing the right thing. He is the son of Imatani Saburou and Imatani Kaori from Konda Village and used to be good childhood friends with Sakujirou, until they fought over the peace in Inazuma.

Appearance[]
Keisuke wears a standard uniform modeled from the ashigaru (Japanese: 足軽) of feudal Japan. He wears a purple-gray shitagi, lavender kobakama, white socks, and waraji sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with pale gold accents consists of dou (breastplate) with the Inazuma Shogunate's crest, kote (armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves). He is also wearing a jingasa (Japanese: 陣笠) with the crest of the Inazuma Shogunate. He is equipped with a juumonji yari (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead.
