 Didn't bring enough...
Media:VO Wanjing 01.ogg "*sigh* Guess I didn't bring enough to cover my travel expenses."

Dialogue[]

Wanjing: So many scenic spots left to visit, but I'm already running out of Mora...
 Scenic spots?
Wanjing: Are you a tourist, too?
Wanjing: Judging from your calm demeanor, you must be one of those "been there, done that" experts who has been just about everywhere, right?
Wanjing: I haven't really gotten around that much myself. I tend to stop pretty frequently while traveling, so at best I've only seen a few of Chenyu Vale's most famous sights.
Wanjing: Yilong Dais is my final stop on this trip. I've heard that burning incense in that censer outside the mountain is super lucky!
Wanjing: But I'm pretty scared of heights, so I might need to ask someone to go there for me... I hope it won't be too expensive...?
 Is traveling around these parts expensive?
Wanjing: No, no, no, Qiaoying Village and Yilong Wharf are both pretty cheap! Food and lodging aren't too costly, and most of the stuff on sale is great quality for the price.
Wanjing: It's just that my travel budget is really limited, and I spent most of it on a Kamera some Fontainian merchant recommended.
Wanjing: It's a good thing the Kamera takes such beautiful pictures! I can even use it to capture how I felt looking at such amazing sights. It's totally worth the Mora!
Wanjing: Who knows? In ten to twenty years, maybe I'll only need to take a glance at these pictures to remember everything I experienced over these few days!
Wanjing: I still need to take some photos from Yilong Dais at the summit...
 Good luck!
Wanjing: Many thanks! Safe travels to you too!
