Profile[]
Nasejuna is the current Vijnanapati of the Order of Skeptics, the equivalent of their "sage," stationed in the Girdle of the Sands to research the strange Abyssal phenomenon occurring in the area. 
While exploring the area, Nasejuna discovered that the ancestors of the Skeptics, the people who were able to resist the impurities of the land were heroes in the eyes of the Dahri but were smeared as sinners and forgotten by the Sumeru Akademiya. To this end, he plotted with the Abyss Order to use the Great Songs of Khvarena to destroy the great tree trying to repel its powers so that the energy from the Abyss would envelop Teyvat, seeing it as "bringing truth without mercy to the unjust world." He had tried to do this by using the Pari known as Sorush, but she had failed to acquire the Chaplet required to do so. He was on the verge of giving up until the Traveler and Paimon appeared.
Using them to his own advantage, upon acquiring the last Great Song, Nasejuna revealed his true intention and hatred for the Pari race. Calling an Abyss Herald known as Klingsor, the two tried to take the songs by force, but were defeated by the Traveler and forced to flee.[1] The Traveler would inform both Pyrrho and Sosi of his betrayal, leaving them shocked.
