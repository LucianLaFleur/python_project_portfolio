Profile[]
Joel is the son of Joserf, who made an expedition to Dragonspine's summit. He did not return after a prolonged period of time, prompting Joel to search for people to help look for his father. Joel flagged down the Traveler and Paimon, where they discovered a collapsed cavern with a campsite, but he was nowhere to be found and his current status unknown. They reported their findings to Joel, who was dismayed but hopeful that his father had made it out alive.

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing A Secret Born From Ashes or Snowy Silhouette: Reunion)
Joel: Who's th— No, Daddy said that I should be more polite...
Joel: ...How do you do?
 Your father?
Joel: Yup, he's an adventurer
Joel: He said that he would come to pick me up and that we'd go watch the snow together. But the time we arranged has come and gone, and he isn't here yet...
Joel: I thought that he must have found some rare and precious treasure map or something, which is why he hasn't come to find me yet. That has to be it, right?
Joel: So I came to Dragonspine by myself. If he's not going to come find me, then I'll go looking for him... Or so I thought...
 So, have you found him yet?
Joel: No... That Knight of Favonius over there said that he'd headed off for the mountain's summit...
Joel: I wanted to go search for him, but the Knight wouldn't let me. So I'm stuck here waiting for Daddy to come back.
Joel: I'll see him for sure, though. We promised to go see the snow together. There's no way that he'd break his promise.
 He'll be fine.
Joel: Thanks... Well, you look like a Traveler. Will be you be going up the mountain to go on more adventures?
Joel: If you are, then please take this pocket watch with you.
Joel: An adventurer gave this to me, he says that it's a watch that brings you luck.
Joel: I wanted to give it to Daddy, but I could never find the chance...
Joel: If you're going up the mountain, you should take it. Hope it'll bring you good luck. Have a safe trip!
(Obtain 1★  Adventurer's Pocket Watch)
 See you around then, kid.
Joel: Goodbye.
Joel: Well, I've seen the snow. Now all that's left is to find Daddy...

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After completing A Secret Born From Ashes or Snowy Silhouette: Reunion)
Joel: Hey, Traveler, it's you!
 How have things been going recently?
Joel: Things are going great! Dad still doesn't remember a ton of stuff, but I'm just happy to have his company!
Joel: I've found some toys that we used to play with together. Maybe he'll remember a couple more things once he sees them!
Joel: I mean, I'd be okay even if he doesn't remember everything. We'll find new toys to play with, and we'll make new memories together!
Joel: Like... Uh...
 Like snowmen?
Joel: Yeah, like snowmen! I love 'em! And hide-and-seek, and building blocks, and reading stories...
Joel: The snow around here is super thick and white. We've already agreed to to make a snowman shaped like a fox later!
 Take care of yourself now.
(If Adventurer's Pocket Watch hasn't been obtained)
Joel: Yup, sure will!
Joel: Oh well, an adventurer gave this to me previously.. He said that it's a watch that brings you luck.
Joel: I mean, I found Dad again, so I guess it must be a lucky watch after all!
Joel: I'll give it to you now. I sure hope it brings you as much luck as it did me!
(Obtain 1★  Adventurer's Pocket Watch)
 See you around, then.
Joel: Yup, see you!
