Dialogue Set #1[]
Available prior to completing Scenes from Life in Meropide: Chit-Chat


Nakul: Other fields also have some very interesting research findings...
 What are you doing here?
Nakul: In the short term, I'm reading the collection of papers gifted to me by the kid in green. He is quite intelligent and an interesting character, and I greatly admire him.
 About the Fortress of Meropide...
Nakul: There's a charm to the place which is hard to explain in only a few words. A mystique combined with a sense of danger, it makes it hard to leave.
Nakul: I can't say what the best choice is, but I find the examples of those people determined to stay here a bit frightening.
 Thanks for your time.
Nakul: My pleasure. For me, being able to talk with the people here is always of benefit.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Scenes from Life in Meropide: Chit-Chat


Nakul: Forget about the difficult tasks, and focus on the ones there's still hope of completing...
 What are you doing here?
Nakul: For now, bargaining with Carranza. But he's too stubborn. I might already get all the materials I need to leave Fontaine before I manage to win him over.

 About a certain someone...

 Thanks for your time.
