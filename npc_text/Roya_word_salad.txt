Dialogue[]

Roya: Fresh fruits and veggies! Great quantity and quality!
 And you are...
Roya: I'm a wholesaler of fruits and vegetables.
Roya: As you can see, there's a great number of merchant ships in the harbor, and my goods are sold in large quantities to meet the needs of ship crews going on long voyages.
Roya: I'm used to selling crates of apples, peaches, potatoes, and tomatoes, so if you were to only buy a few, I wouldn't really know how to price them.
 I'd like a couple...
Roya: Just a couple? Just take some, then.
Roya: It's not worth a fortune, just go ahead and take some.
Roya: Right, since it's just a handful, eat them while they're still fresh!
(Obtain  Zaytun Peach ×4)
 See you.
Roya: Let me know if you have any large orders!
