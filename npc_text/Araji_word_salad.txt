Araji is an Aranara historical figure from five hundred years ago. Araji, Arayama, and Aramaha sealed each of the three Ashvattha's Concourses with their own rhythms, and then turned themselves into Vasara Trees. Araji's Vasara Tree is located at Gandha Hill, Avidya Forest.
His rhythm, "Rhythm of the Gloomy Path," opens Gloomy Paths which lead to secret sites.[1]

Araji, Aramaha, and Arayama's friendship was comparable to the friendship of the three God-Kings: King Deshret, the Goddess of Flowers, and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.[2] Araji was also a great friend of Arayasa's, who describes him as a "timid friend who liked to hide in quiet places and sing softly."[3]
Before the Aranara abandoned Old Vanarana, Araji wrote the second Inscription of Remembrance in his house. 
Araji was familiar with the Traveler's Sibling, who assisted the Aranara during the cataclysm, and "picked up a thing or two" from them.[4] It was presumably also around this time that Araji fought against Marana and transformed into a Vasara Tree, leaving behind his song as a method to unseal the Ashvattha's Concourse.[3]
