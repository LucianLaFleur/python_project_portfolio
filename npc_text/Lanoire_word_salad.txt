Lanoire is the daughter of the deceased Agnes and granddaughter of Earnshaw. She was born in the Fortress of Meropide and lived her early life there. She is technically an unregistered individual in the Fortress. Sometime after she was born, her mother Agnes died, and from then on she was raised by the people of the Fortress, mainly Caterpillar. She calls Caterpillar as Cater.
After the events of Unfinished Comedy, she can be found with Earnshaw at his house, on the foothills of Mont Esus in the Court of Fontaine Region.

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
After finishing Unfinished Comedy, during daytime.


Lanoire:  It's too bad Cater isn't here! If he was, he could enjoy this with us too!
Earnshaw: Even if Cater was here, you still wouldn't be allowed to drink any more Fonta today.
Lanoire:  Awww... But Cater said, you have to share with others to be even more happy!
Earnshaw: I'm sure Cater also said not to have too much sugar and to brush your teeth after eating.
Lanoire:  Oh... He did mention that...

Dialogue Set #2[]
After finishing Happy Birthday, during daytime.


Lanoire: I don't know what sort of cake Cater likes...

Lanoire: Oh, I was just wondering what flavor of cake I should make for Cater's birthday!
Lanoire: ...Because now that I think about it, Cater always gives me food, but I don't know what he likes to eat.
Lanoire: Does he like Bulle Fruit? Or Sunsettia? Actually, since he's that color, maybe he likes Mint?
Lanoire: But, more importantly, I've gotta find Cater. Wait for me to grow up, (‍Mr.Mr.Text for male Traveler/Ms.Ms.Text for female Traveler‍) (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), and we'll go look for him together.
 You can do it, Lanoire.
Lanoire: Okay! I'm definitely gonna make the most delicious birthday cake ever.
Lanoire: Oh, I don't know your birthdays either, (‍Mr.Mr.Text for male Traveler/Ms.Ms.Text for female Traveler‍) (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), Ms. Paimon...
