 About Stormterror...
(After completing A Long Shot)
Nelson: What I think? I think that now that this is all over, I can finally proudly declare that "Mondstadt is a great place!"
Nelson: The scenery's good, the wine is fine, and the Knights of Favonius will defend us when crises come. That's what I call great!
 How is it?
Nelson: You need to ask? Drinks brewed from the waters of Cider Lake are famous in all Teyvat.
Nelson: Here, have a taste! Oh, you can't drink alcohol? What a shame.
 How's Mondstadt?
Nelson: This is a good place.
Nelson: As to the Crown of the North, the romantic City of Pastorals, it's all writers' way of putting it.
Nelson: To me, beautiful scenery and good wine are more than enough!
Nelson: *hic* The wine here is the best. I'm not going anywhere.
 Goodbye.
