Profile[]
Skirk is the disciple of Surtalogi, and has spent much if not all of her time in the Abyss. She is said to live in another ancient world, the dark realm,[6] or the darkest corners of the universe.[7] In her realm, time flows differently from the known world; three months in her realm amount to three days in Teyvat.
While she acknowledges that living is a blessing, she notes that a person's death will turn their bonds into "curses", hence why she no longer wishes to return to the surface.
When Tartaglia fell into the Abyss at the age of fourteen, Skirk took him under her wing and taught him almost all of his abilities. When Tartaglia asked her why she decided to take him as an apprentice, she told him that it was because he had awakened "it" and still had traces of "it" on him, so she was teaching him combat skills because it would be useful in the future. Tartaglia speculates that the "it" she talked about might be related to the narwhal he saw in his dream when he had just fallen into the Abyss. Tartaglia tried to search for her again for years, but couldn't find any trace of her or the place where he fell into the Abyss.[5]
Although her affiliation with the Abyss Order is not attested, she at least knows how to survive in the Abyss and taught her methods to Tartaglia.[6]
Though she regards him as her disciple, Skirk claims that she wasn't talkative with Tartaglia during the time she trained him because she 'has nothing to say to the weak'.  She speaks to those she considers as equals to avoid miscommunication; as someone "greater than humanity", there are many problems whenever she tried talking to humans due to what she refers to as 'difference in common sense'.

Lore[]
When Neuvillette and the Traveler descended into the Primordial Sea to confront the All-Devouring Narwhal, they were able to subdue it long enough for Skirk to appear with an unconscious Childe (who had fainted from fighting the narwhal for a prolonged time), converting the beast into a small orb before throwing both into the rift she came out of. She expressed exasperation at how her disciple and her "master's pet" started brawling each other during her "short private training session", and acknowledged both Neuvillette and the Traveler's strengths to defeat the narwhal without relying on "power from beyond this world", likely referring to the Abyss. She revealed her master's identity along with someone else known as Vedrfolnir before reminding them of the prophecy.[8]
After the Narwhal was far enough that it could no longer interfere with her, Skirk could properly "smell" Neuvillette's power; that of an Ancient Dragon Authority with a god's "curse", the Hydro Gnosis, mixed in, which she recognized as the "remains" of the third Descender and suggested that he discard it as it was an item that brought misfortune. He asked her about their identity and when they died, though she did not know. She did promise to find out and that she would send Tartaglia to convey her words to him when the time arose.[9]

Abilities and Powers[]
According to Tartaglia, Skirk is an exceptionally skilled and seasoned swordswoman and a strict teacher; while he is known as one of the most dangerous among the Eleven Fatui Harbingers[10] and was explicitly recruited for his combat prowess,[11] he states that she could easily beat him with one hand. He is hopeful that in their next encounter at his current power, he could force her to use both of them.[12]
As an indication to her prowess, during Masquerade of the Guilty, she states she intended to fight the All-Devouring Narwhal in a "short private training session", despite Childe battling the creature for days ultimately unable to take it down and Neuvillette needing his full Dragon Authority in order to separate it from the power from the Primordial Sea it accrued in order to then battle and defeat it.
