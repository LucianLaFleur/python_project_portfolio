Profile[]
Sandrone was first mentioned in the description of Tartaglia's Character Tale, "Childe: Sigil of Permission," which recounts that she once admonished Javert.
According to both Tartaglia and Wanderer, Sandrone is always engrossed in her research on Automatons, and she can be seen riding a modified Ruin Machine in A Winter Night's Lazzo. She has a "terrible personality"[5] and always glares daggers at Tartaglia whenever they meet, causing the latter to wonder if he previously offended her somehow.[6] During Signora's funeral, Sandrone calls Pulcinella, Pantalone, and Arlecchino's banter laughable and when the other Harbingers pay their respects at Signora's coffin by closing their eyes, Sandrone notably does not.[7]
It is highly implied that Sandrone is the Harbinger who took an interest in Mosso Lombroso's work and his creation, "Curve", having Baulande's supervisor make contact with Jenck. To escape capture, Jenck destroyed Mosso's laboratory, which subsequently destroyed Curve, who sacrificed its life to save the Traveler, Paimon and Talochard. Jenck was later found trussed up inside the Opera Epiclese with his tongue cut out and mind broken, which Euphrasie surmised was either Jenck's backer not wanting to make enemies out of them or feeling remorse at Curve's destruction.[8][Note 1]

Appearance[]
Sandrone is a young, pale-skinned woman of medium height, with beige-colored hair with a similar style to the female Traveler: a medium-length bob with two long strands framing her face and has blue-gray eyes.
Her outfit consists of a long white dress with a black corset with the symbol of the Fatui in the middle with a ruby ​​reddish tone, her dress has transparent white wavy sleeves, she wears black gloves that only cover the thumb, she wears stockings white with dark brown boots.

She is extremely... passionate about her research and does not appear in public often. In fact, many of our officers have yet to see her at all. Compared to, let's say, someone who would go so far as to create segments of themselves to better wander across the land, I suppose you could say she is at the other end of the extreme.TartagliaAbout Marionette Media:VO_Tartaglia About Marionette.ogg Media:VO ZH_Tartaglia About Marionette.ogg Media:VO JA_Tartaglia About Marionette.ogg Media:VO KO_Tartaglia About Marionette.ogg She always seems engrossed in her research. Hmm... I wonder if those machines have anything to do with her? Anyway, I've only met her a few times, but every time she looked like she wanted to murder me. I have no idea what I possibly could have done to annoy her, though.WandererAbout Marionette Media:VO_Wanderer About Marionette.ogg Media:VO ZH_Wanderer About Marionette.ogg Media:VO JA_Wanderer About Marionette.ogg Media:VO KO_Wanderer About Marionette.ogg She has a terrible personality and cares for nothing outside of her own research. But even with that amount of dedication, she still produced a copious amount of garbage, and could only secure a ranking that's still one whole place beneath my own. How pitiful.
Trivia[]
Sandrone's form, save from her color scheme, bears a striking resemblance to Katheryne, the Snezhnayan bionic puppet, and the receptionist of all branches of the Adventurers' Guild. Considering Sandrone's high interest in automatons, it is highly likely that the Katheryne's are creations of Sandrone, which she based their form on her own appearance.
Sandrone shares her Korean voice actress, Kang Eun-ae, with Kirara.
Etymology[]
In commedia dell'arte, from which the Eleven Fatui Harbingers' aliases and titles are derived, Sandrone, his wife, and his son were originally represented by puppets.

Notes[]

↑ Of the two Harbingers known for their interest in machines, the one behind Jenck severely punishes him for causing Curve's destruction and leaves an apology for Talochard, Paimon, and Traveler. This response does not align with The Doctor's characterization, leaving Sandrone as the likely identity of the mystery Harbinger.
