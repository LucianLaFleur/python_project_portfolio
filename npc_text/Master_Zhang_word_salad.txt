Dialogue[]

Master Zhang: Need to buy a weapon? Or have on custom-built? Repairs are free, just let me know if you come across any prize ore.
 I'd like something made.
(If nothing has been forged)

Master Zhang: Have you brought the right materials? Let's see the goods.
(If something has been forged but not collected yet)

Master Zhang: Oh, your order from last time is ready. Are you here to collect it, or to place a new order?
 About Liyue's mining products...
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Master Zhang knows; Version 1)

Master Zhang: Liyue is the dominion of Rex Lapis himself. Our ores could never disappoint.
Master Zhang: Fortunately, I've built up quite the network while helping people repair their equipment free of charge. They furnish me with information concerning ores from time to time.
Master Zhang: They've found quite a fair bit of abnormal Crystal Ore lately. Some call them Magical Crystal Ores — ordinary Crystal Ores can't hold a candle to them in either form or quality.
Master Zhang: It's a shame that they are so hard to work with. Even I cannot make heads or tails of them...
Master Zhang: If you can find a way to work with these ores, do come and find me.
Master Zhang: I've marked the location of those ore veins on your map. Poke your nose around those parts, and you'll turn up something for sure.
(Rich Ore Reserves marked on the map)
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Master Zhang knows; Version 2)

Master Zhang: Liyue is the dominion of Rex Lapis himself. Our ores could never disappoint.
Master Zhang: Fortunately, I've built up quite the network while helping people repair their equipment free of charge. They furnish me with information concerning ores from time to time.
Master Zhang: Recently, they've come across a lot of Crystal Ore. It's just a shame that I've been busy. If you've got the time, go mine some, come back here and have them refined.
Master Zhang: I've marked the location of those ore veins on your map. Poke your nose around those parts, and you'll turn up something for sure.
(Rich Ore Reserves marked on the map)
(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Master Zhang knows)

Master Zhang: Ores... You've been to the many ore veins nearby, haven't you?
Master Zhang: I don't have anything new for you now. Perhaps you should try your luck later.
 What are you selling?
Master Zhang: Quality weapons made from the finest ore using time-honored techniques. Take your pick.
 About Hanfeng's Ironmongers...
Master Zhang: My dad left me this place when he retired. He lives in Qingce Village now.
Master Zhang: When he left me the shop, he also left me with a word of advice — a solid business is founded on solid relationships.
Master Zhang: Whenever I get laborers and miners coming in here for repairs, I never charge them for it. In return, I only ask that they keep me informed when they find any rare ore.
Master Zhang: It's every ironmonger's dream to fashion a legendary weapon, the sharpest blade of them all... Liyue is the land of the Lord of Geo, so I figure this is where I'll have the best chance of finding the prize ore I'd need...
Master Zhang: If I can get the edge over the competition right from the source, from the raw materials, I can push them out and really strengthen the Hanfeng name... Hehehe, so let me know if you find anything!
 Goodbye.
Master Zhang: Bye. Come back if ever need anything.
