 A silent song...
Media:VO Caron 01.ogg "Time itself is a silent song."

Dialogue[]

Caron: If clocks are the score of time's song, then what can I do for it...
 I'd like to use this Crafting Bench.
Caron: Oh, please feel free.
 Tell me about the clocks...
Caron: Clocks — or to be more precisely, exquisite clockwork-powered clocks — are our family craft, famous throughout Fontaine.
Caron: Have you heard of the Lady of the Lake's Tear?
Caron: That was the name Lady Furina gave to one of my works.
Caron: What a lovely name, like a song that encapsulates such sadness.
 A lover of poetry, are we...
Caron: Haha, yes, that unsightly attempt of mine. Now, I do not hate my work, but I also love poetry and song.
Caron: My elder brother has gone on to live his own life, while I inherited the family business.
Caron: It's quite unadventurous and unromantic of me, but I do not desire that this craft be lost.
 Sorry for bothering you.
Caron: No worries. May time's song remember you.
