Dialogue[]

Yinxing: Are you alright? Are you do feel unwell anywhere? I'll have a look at it. So, on your back now, just like that...
 I'm fine.
Yinxing: Oh, that's great, then!
Yinxing: I'm the ship's doctor. Seasickness, wind chills, amputations, I do them all around here.
Yinxing: You can have full confidence in my skills. If there's anything at all, you can come to me!
 On my... back?
Yinxing: Oh! I'm sorry!
Yinxing: I... when we dock at Liyue Harbor, I often take care of injured cats and the like.
Yinxing: Over time, I've started talking to people in the same way. Please don't take offense.
Yinxing: Now that I mention it, I left some small stray kittens in the hands of a Millelith soldier named Yong'an the last time, I wonder how they're doing now...
 Goodbye.
Yinxing: So nothing's the matter with you? Great! Keep watching your health!
