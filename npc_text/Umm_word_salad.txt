Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies.


Umm: Greetings, welcome to Gandharva Ville.
Umm: Life is comfortable here, right? It's much better than the city!
 Tell me about yourself...
Umm: I'm the longest living resident here... One of them anyway. Perhaps only Keon, who's a few years my elder, can compete with me.
Umm: It was a blessing in disguise, this carefree life in the forest.
Umm: I was a researcher of the Akademiya in my youth, but I was caught up in vicious academic competition.
Umm: Hmph! I didn't want to fight with those unethical researchers. A secluded life in the forest was way better.
Umm: It was at here where I realized that knowledge, power, and wealth are the source of our troubles, and that a simple life is the best life.
Umm: Those youngsters from the Akademiya should learn the Forest Rangers' way of life!
 Forest Rangers are civil servants too...
Umm: ...You can't just group them up together because they are all civil servants!
Umm: Let me explain... It's like how... the Dendro Archon and the Greater Lord are incomparable to each other. Do you get it now?
Umm: Instead of asking me more questions, why don't you just stay a few days? I'm certain you'll get to know the simplicity and beauty of forest life.
 Do you not like the city?
Umm: What's so great about the city? Its atmosphere always feels weird to me.
Umm: No matter how tall the buildings that are built leaning against the Divine Tree are, we seem to draw no closer to the gods.
Umm: Otherwise, why would researchers who so desperately yearn for knowledge come to Avidya Forest to gain success?
Umm: ...Not that I'm saying that knowledge is that good, but you should understand what I mean, right?
 See you.
Umm: You're leaving already? *sigh* You still haven't understood the true meaning of a carefree life, I see.

Umm: Let me give you an example... It's like... It's like how Bouncy Mushrooms and Floppy Mushrooms are all mushrooms, but their characteristics are completely different. Get it?
Umm: You know what? Instead of asking me more questions, why don't you just stay a few days? I'm certain you'll get to know the simplicity and beauty of forest life.
 Do you not like the city?
