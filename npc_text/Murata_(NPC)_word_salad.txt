 Don't miss it!

Dialogue[]

(After completing Festive Elegance)
Murata: This is the official Yae Publishing House booth, but we're still setting it all up. We'll only open once the Irodori Festival starts.
(After completing The Strange Tale of Suikou's Tipsy Tincture)
Murata: Here's the official Yae Publishing House stall! Come check it out!
 I'm looking to buy some books.
Murata: Take your pick! We've got all sorts of new books here at the Irodori Festival!
(Opens Shop menu)
 How's the festival going?
(Before completing The Five Colors' True Form)

Murata: This Irodori Festival is different from ones in years past. I imagine that it's quite the sight for our guests.
Murata: That said, I'm just here to collect the Mora, give out the change, thank people for their patronage... the works.
Murata: Ah, sorry, no time for chit-chat. If Hirayama catches me, I'll be in hot stew for sure!
(After completing The Five Colors' True Form)

Murata: Oh, things have been going quite smoothly. Everyone in the editorial team has finally been able to heave a sigh of relief.
Murata: Although the release event has ended, the festival will continue for a while more. I believe that there's also ongoing ikebana and Theater Mechanicus events...
Murata: I'd have gone to take part in them myself if I didn't have to stay here to watch the booth.
 See you.
Murata: Yes, please come again!
