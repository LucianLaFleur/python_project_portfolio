Sugimoto and his family live in Inazuma City.[1] One day, while Daisuke was away from their house, Misuzu and Sugimoto were attacked and abducted by Nogata's gang of vagrants (including the Blue Oni Takuya). They were imprisoned in the vagrants' hideout and were worried about Daisuke, not knowing whether or not he was safe. Though the captives, Misuzu and Sugimoto included, were fearful of what the vagrants might do to them, Takuya always defended them from the worst of it and snuck them food at night. When the Traveler and Arataki Itto rescue the captives, Sugimoto tries to calm Misuzu when she asks about Daisuke, saying they don't know if he was captured or not. He also tells the Traveler about the vagrants and how Takuya protected them.
After they are freed, Misuzu and Sugimoto are able to reunite with Daisuke. They thank the Traveler and Granny Oni for their help, expressing well-wishes for Itto (who had been arrested) as well, before heading back to Inazuma City.
