Story[]
At some point in their lives, Kunihiko and his brother Toraemon were adopted by an Iwakura Art practitioner. When Toraemon and fellow disciple Yanagiha Arashi were expelled from the clan by its previous master, Eiin, Kunihiko presumably remained, as he did not his follow his brother. Sometime after, Nagatane died and was succeeded by Iwakura Mitsunari.
When the Vision Hunt Decree was enacted, Mitsunari had his Vision taken and decided to join the Shogunate forces.[1] Many of the other clan members saw this as a betrayal of their clan's pursuit of righteousness and deserted him, choosing to fight against the Shogunate or going rogue completely. Based on his dialogue upon initiating combat, Kunihiko was the latter; he only cared about testing his strength against the Traveler's. The Traveler ultimately slays him, and his last words are calling out to his brother.
After receiving word that a Traveler has been going around killing Iwakura Art disciples, Toraemon and Arashi travel around Inazuma to retrieve their swords for a memorial. This memorial is built in the same place where Kunihiko was slain, with Toraemon voicing his desire to avenge Kunihiko in particular before forcing the Traveler into a fight. They, too, are slain and the Traveler lays their swords to rest with the others'.[2][3]

Dialogue[]
