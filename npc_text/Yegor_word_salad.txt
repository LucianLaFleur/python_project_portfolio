(Daytime)
 Can't get used to the food...
Media:VO Yegor 01.ogg "Inazuma's cooking... I'm not used to it at all!"

 Treasure in Inazuma...
Media:VO Yegor 02.ogg "*sigh* Is there really legendary treasure in Inazuma?"

Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Yegor: Hello, is there anything I can do for you?
 What's bothering you?
(Before completing Transient Dreams)

Yegor: It's actually not that big of a deal. I'm applying to travel to Narukami Island, and I'm guessing that my request should be processed soon.
Yegor: But I'm a Snezhnayan, and I'm not really used to the diet here, nor am I a good cook myself.
Yegor: I'm fine here in Ritou, but I've heard that there isn't a single shop run by outlanders on Narukami Island. There are only Inazuma-style restaurants available.
Yegor: *sigh* I wonder if I can still eat anything that reminds me of home once I'm in Inazuma City... If only Miss Ryouko could come with me as well...
(After completing Transient Dreams)

Yegor: It's nothing serious, really. I'm living just fine here in Ritou, and business has been great since the Sakoku Decree was abolished.
Yegor: But I'm a Snezhnayan, and I'm not really used to the diet here, nor am I a good cook myself.
Yegor: I'm fine here in Ritou, but I've heard that there isn't a single shop run by outlanders in Inazuma City. There are only Inazuma-style restaurants available.
Yegor: *sigh* I wonder if I can still eat anything that reminds me of home once I'm in Inazuma City... If only Miss Ryouko could come with me as well...
 Why did you come to Inazuma?
Yegor: As you can see, I'm a Snezhnayan merchant. So naturally, I'm here for business.
Yegor: Apart from doing business, I also plan to travel around Inazuma.
Yegor: I've heard a lot of legends about places in Inazuma. Perhaps I might be able to find something if I go check those places out.
 Miss Ryouko?
Yegor: Yeah. Miss Ryouko is a lady who runs a food stall there. Have you ever tried her snacks?
Yegor: She knew that I wouldn't be used to the food here, so she changed the taste up for me... That's so sweet of her!
Yegor: I've heard that her husband passed away several years ago, leaving her to take care of the stall alone...
Yegor: Hmm... I suppose I should go visit her stall more often.
 Help her...
Yegor: Say, if I can learn how to cook, would I be able to open a shop with Ryouko?
Yegor: I tried cooking recently, but it feels like I'm not made out of the right stuff for a chef...
Yegor: Have a try. Is my cooking really that bad...?
(Obtain  Suspicious Steak ×4)
 Goodbye.
Yegor: Okay, goodbye.

Nighttime[]

Yegor: The legendary treasure... Now isn't that exciting?
 Treasure?
(Before completing Transient Dreams)

Yegor: Huh? You heard that? Oh, that's problematic, um...
Yegor: But judging by your gear, you seem like a seasoned adventurer... Well, then I'll be honest with you.
Yegor: I have a friend who has been to Inazuma before. He told me a lot of legends about the treasures in Inazuma. He also mentioned a lot of places, like Konda Village or whatever that place is called...
Yegor: Sadly, I can't leave Ritou yet. If you can figure out a way to get into Inazuma, could you help me ask around?

Yegor: I have a friend who has been to Inazuma before. He told me a lot of legends about the treasures in Inazuma. He also mentioned a lot of places, like Konda Village or whatever that place is called...
Yegor: If you've got some contacts, could you help me ask around?
 Aren't you afraid that I might take the treasures for myself?
Yegor: Hehe, I don't think you will. After all, I haven't told you the most important piece of information yet!
Yegor: Even if you find out anything about it, you'll still need clues from me to continue.
Yegor: And I on the other hand am no expert adventurer. I'll need a helping hand.
Yegor: Once you get the information, we can strike up a partnership. Rest assured, I will pay you handsomely.
 Goodbye.
Yegor: Goodbye.
