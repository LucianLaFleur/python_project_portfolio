Xu's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Xu works for the Feiyun Commerce Guild, primarily under Xingqiu.
When the guild acquired the Kamera, Xu helped out in test trials to see if it would sell well in the city. However, demand was greater than he expected and with his master missing, he tasked the Traveler to give the photos to Tea Master Liu Su and Granny Shan. After the Traveler gave the photos to them, Xu rewarded them with the Kamera.

Idle Quotes[]

 Where has Master gone...
Media:VO Xu 01.ogg "*sigh* Where has Master gone this time?"

Fleeting Colors in Flight


 Master's work...
Media:VO Xu Lantern Rite 01.ogg "I'm sure Master's work is probably going smoothly."

Dialogue[]

Xu: Just where has our Master gone wandering off to this time? Honestly...
Xu: Oh, my apologies. How may the Feiyun Commerce Guild be of assistance to you, good sirs?
 Sirs...?
Xu: Yes, I'm referring to you. The vast majority of visitors here are in big business, so I've become accustomed to speaking politely.
Xu: What's more, the master here has made it clear, if you want to be in business, you be polite to everyone.
Xu: If you treat people by their appearances, one day you're going to offend someone very important.
Xu: Call it a business principle of the Feiyun Commerce Guild if you will.
 Master?
Xu: The master I just referred to?
Xu: A lot of our business is left up to him, including our most important silk trade.
Xu: As incredibly gifted as he may be in the art of business, his heart isn't in it. He has a habit of suddenly disappearing.
Xu: What's even more impressive is the fact that this hasn't affected business in the slightest. Conversely, business over the last few years has only become better and better.
Xu: Even if you do manage to catch him, there's nothing to really accost him for anyway so...
Xu: *sigh* I can't make sense of it...
 We need to get going.
Xu: Take care. If you have anymore business to attend to, remember us here at Feiyun Commerce Guild, won't you?

Event Dialogue[]
Fleeting Colors in Flight[]

Xu: I've heard that Master's taken on quite a fair bit of work this Lantern Rite. It should be going smoothly, of course.
Xu: Still, there's neither hide nor hair of him, as always...
Xu: Oh, my apologies. How may the Feiyun Commerce Guild be of assistance to you, good sirs?
