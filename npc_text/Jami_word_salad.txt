Event Dialogue[]
Fayz Trials[]

Jami: Agh! If only I'd known this would happen, I'd have just applied to join Spantamad at matriculation!
Jami: So, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), how's the research going...?
 About your mentor...
Jami: My mentor's just awful! I've made up my mind. If I get to finish my research in time, I shall stand on his desk and slap him with my draft manuscript!
Jami: Or so I wish... I am grateful to him, though. He's been strict, yes. But it's for our own good. I know that much.
 About the "Fayz Potion"...
Jami: I don't have any more of it. I gave all I had to you, and it would be a pain to make more...
Jami: You know, I did always think that there were maybe two steps too many in the production process. I omitted them this time, and the result seems to actually have improved...
Jami: Eh? Why didn't I make that my research topic instead...? ... Agh!
Jami: Curses! There's... there's no time to change topics now, is there!?
 I'm still working on it...
Jami: I'll leave you to them, then. Good luck!

Fayz Trials: Hypothesis[]

Jami: *sigh* I should really decide on a budget before starting an experiment next time... Managing a project is so much harder than working on the experiment itself...
Jami: How was it, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? Did the experiment go smoothly?
 About the "Fayz Potion"...
Jami: The Fayz Potion is pretty amazing, huh? It's a shame that it only works in specific environments.
Jami: If I could improve the versatility of the Fayz Potion, it would definitely become a popular research topic. Hmm, improving its versatility...
Jami: Curses, why didn't I think of that earlier? I could've just researched that instead!
Jami: Ugh, the more I think about it, the more I regret choosing my current topic...
 About your research topic...
Jami: Yeah, sorry for not explaining clearly... But why would you be interested in this?
Jami: Anyway, the project I'm currently working on is called "A Study on the Defense Deficiencies of Biological Structures in Response to Hostile Stressors."
Jami: Simply put, I'm researching the weaknesses revealed by creatures during combat and defense behaviors in dangerous environments.
Jami: It's like when a Rishboland Tiger comes leaping at you and you quickly slip under its tummy to dodge its attack... Weird analogy, I know, but that's basically how it is.
Jami: I wanted to study creatures active across larger areas, and many of those creatures are native to Liyue. That's why I chose to set up my experimental site here.
 I'm still working on it.
Jami: Ah, okay then. I hope everything goes smoothly... Please stay safe!

The Great Fayz Reaction Debate[]

Jami: *sigh* I'll wait a bit before showing this experiment report to my mentor.
 Why's that?
Jami: Well, my mentor's... still kinda laid up at Bimarstan.
Jami: The doctors say that he'll only recover next month at the earliest. Recently, many of my senior students have said that his temper's improved... Well, getting angry is counterproductive to recovering from internal injuries, after all.
Jami: Only when he sees me does he get so angry that his beard stands on end and he will try to get out of bed, clutching his cane.
Jami: The doctors say that we shouldn't meet for the time being. I mean, "absence makes the heart grow fonder," yes?
(After clearing all stages)
Jami: I wonder if my life would have been easier had I not chosen this topic back then?
Jami: Maybe I'd have gone with something my seniors had studied before, and done a synthesis of some kind...
Jami: I'd have edited the data to get the result I wanted... Not like anyone would want to replicate such dull research anyway...
Jami: That's what they call "shooting first and drawing the target later," yes? Either way, I just wanted you to know that research is mostly a process of muddling along.
 That doesn't seem to apply to you.
Jami: *sigh* I fear I was just an idiot who didn't realize what was going on. Our mentor was quite strict with us, too, so I just ended up on this path.
Jami: But since I'm here, I might as well go all the way. Ah, I do hope the experiment goes well — it's either that, or I'm done for once my mentor gets out of bed next month!
