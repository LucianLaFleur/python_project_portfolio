Noailles is a new guard hired at Meropide and does not like Fonta. During Game of the Rich, Noailles tries to recreate missing records on the prisoner Caterpillar.[1] Estienne does not like him, claiming that he's "sick" in the head and tries to make everyone follow his rules.
When Lanoire and Cater try to escape Meropide the first time, Noailles and a large number of Gardemeks confronted them, though Caterpillar was forced to reveal his true form as an Anemo Hilichurl Rogue in the process. Noailles was shocked to see a talking hilichurl and wondered how he infiltrated the prison. Cater, knowing that Lanoire did not belong in the prison, negotiated to return if she would be released, which he agreed to, though he went back on his word by having her come with him to fill some papers out. Later on, the group attempted to escape again, which Noailles anticipated and had sent a large deployment of Gardes and Gardemeks to patrol the area, though they were bypassed. He eventually realized they had escaped and confronted them at the Geode Mine Shaft, where he was quickly defeated, though before he could do anything, Estienne arrived and took him into custody, as he had broken rules and violated regulations by using the Gardemeks without authorization.[2] It is implied that he was punished for his actions and would not be returning to the prison anytime soon.
