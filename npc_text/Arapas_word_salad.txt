Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Available during An Unwavering Culinary Dream)
Arapas: Is there water that can give taste to soup?

Dialogue Set #2[]

(Available after An Unwavering Culinary Dream)
Arapas: The soup using Vanarana water, tastes almost the same with that using "Living Spring"...
 They are both nice water, after all.
Arapas: Well said, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), so smart, as if you have been drinking Vanarana water all the time.
Arapas: This time, soup using Vanarana water for Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Next time, I will find nicer water.
 The taste is key...
Arapas: The taste... Hmm...
Arapas: I heard that follow the running river and you find a big area of water with strong scent. Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) wants soup with that water?
 Sounds much too strong...
Arapas: Really? Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), so strange. You said water with scent is delicious, but you hate water with too much scent.
Arapas: Guess clear water is better for soup.
 Goodbye.
Arapas: Bye, hope Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) will always have delicious water to drink.

Dialogue Set #3[]

(Available during Festival Utsava)‍[verification needed]
Arapas: Vanarana water is nice. But I heard, in the north, there is sweeter and clearer water...

Dialogue Set #4[]

(Available after Festival Utsava)‍[verification needed]
Arapas: The soup at Festival Utsava... Very "shocking." So I am going to look for nicer water in the north.
 The north?
Arapas: I heard that there is Vana's river source's source in the north. The water there is clearer than moonlight. A pot filled with that water looks as if is holding nothing but air.
Arapas: Soup cooked with that water, will make Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) and Aranara happy. I am sure.
Arapas: So, in my "special cooking training," I will follow the direction that tree shadows point to, and find nicer water than Vanarana water.
 Goodbye.
Arapas: Hope to see Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) in the north.
