  Mentioned CharactersTengu 




Reizenbou (Japanese: 霊善坊)[1] was the Great Tengu of the Yougou Tengu five hundred years ago, the mentor of the Yougou Three, and the mother of Teruyo. She was close with the Kitsune Saiguu and became the kitsune's bodyguard after being beaten in a race. Following her failure to protect the Kitsune Saiguu during the cataclysm, Reizenbou went on a self-imposed exile.
Reizenbou was the original wielder of Thundering Pulse before she gave it to Takamine the Mistsplitter as a result of their bet. The Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates was her final abode.

Reizenbou was rather rambunctious and enjoyed fighting.[2] She was also said to be impatient.[3]

Story[]
At an unknown point after the Great Tengu Sasayuri died, Reizenbou became the chieftain of the Yougou Tengu. She was presumably close with Makoto and Ei, as she was bestowed with the bow Thundering Pulse.[3]
At some point in time, Reizenbou and the Kitsune Saiguu had a race; while the Kitsune Saiguu won, she suspected that Reizenbou had allowed her win. Following the Kitsune Saiguu's victory, Reizenbou became her bodyguard.[4] According to the Otogi Kongou Lion King, the wielder of the Redhorn Stonethresher, Reizenbou was also familiar with him.[1]
Before the cataclysm, Reizenbou served as a mentor for the Yougou Three, a group consisting of Asase Hibiki, Kamuna Harunosuke, and Mikoshi Nagamasa, who traveled to Mt. Yougou to learn the Tengu arts.[2][5] Among the techniques she taught them was "true 'magic.'"[6][7] During their tutelage with Reizenbou, Asase and Kamuna also became familiar with the Kitsune Saiguu and the Grand Narukami Shrine.
Around the same time, Takamine the Mistsplitter became her servant in exchange for possession of Thundering Pulse as a result of their bet coming to a draw.[3] She taught him Tengu archery, which was apparently a skill she did not teach the Yougou Three, seeing as Takamine later taught it to Asase as to not waste his archery skills.[8]
Reizenbou gave birth to a daughter, Teruyo, around the time she was mentoring the Yougou Three.[2]

The Cataclysm[]
When the cataclysm 500 years ago struck, causing monsters corrupted with Abyssal powers to rampage across Teyvat, Reizenbou was among those who helped combat the monsters. At some point presumably during this time, she and the Kitsune Saiguu went to the Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates. While exploring the ruins under Araumi, Asase and Kamuna found traces of their presence.[9] However, the Kitsune Saiguu eventually lost her life and disappeared. Out of rage at her own inability to prevent the fox envoy's sacrifice, Reizenbou went on a self-imposed exile in the Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates, leaving Teruyo behind and refusing to emerge before humanity ever again.[2][10][Note 1]

Notes[]

↑ The English translation of the phrase "and this would later become the cage in which they (Yougou Three), having despaired, spent the rest of their days." in the description of Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates has somewhat deviated from the original Chinese 后来成了此人灰心之后虚度余生的樊笼，沉入了海下. The phrase 此人 lit. "this person" is an archaic expression which is almost always used as a singular. Therefore, a more plausible interpretation would be "Thereafter, [this boat] became the house of seclusion (lit. bird cage) in which this person (Reizenbou), having despaired, spent the rest of of her days in vain and [the boat] finally sunk into the sea."
