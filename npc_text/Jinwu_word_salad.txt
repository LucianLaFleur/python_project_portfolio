Location[]
Jinwu is initially located on the surface near the easternmost waypoint of The Chasm, in a hut just past Muning.
During Chasm Spelunkers, she moves down into the Ad-Hoc Main Tunnel of The Chasm: Underground Mines, next to the waypoint in the west cave. After the player completes the steps regarding Uncle He's whereabouts, she then moves to the Chasm Exploration Team Camp near the northwestern waypoint in the east cave of the Ad-Hoc Main Tunnel.
After completing Perils in the Dark, she will move to the team's second camp near the southeastern waypoint of The Glowing Narrows.

Jinwu's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
A member of the Engineering Department, Jinwu has worked at The Chasm as a technician for over 20 years, although she advises the Traveler against going into her line of work. She was present when a mysterious crystal, which the miners dubbed the Wish Granter, was found and witnessed scores of miners return from The Chasm with psychological issues after coming into contact with it. Shortly after the Liyue Qixing sealed off The Chasm, they formed an expedition team to investigate the changes in the area. Jinwu was the Deputy Research Director of that expedition.[1]

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available prior to completing Step 1 of Chasm Spelunkers.


Jinwu: Huh, it's a new face. Ho there, youngster!
 "New face?"
Jinwu: Well, I don't quite know everyone here at the mine, but it's only polite to at least call everyone *something*, right? Still... you look like this is your first time here. Am I right?
 Indeed you are. (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)'s the name, and the pleasure is all mine.
Jinwu: Jinwu. I'm in charge of the facilities here. I've worked at the mines for the past 20-odd years. To most of these lads, I'm their big sister. You have any questions, or the facilities give you any trouble? Give me a shout.
Jinwu: And if you're up for a few old stories, I'm up for telling them. I mean, if we're free, we're free to talk, eh?
 Could you tell me about The Chasm's history?
Jinwu: Wow, that's going to be quite the story. How about I give you a short introduction instead?
Jinwu: So The Chasm's the biggest mine in Liyue bar none, and it's also the oldest in the land — if you don't count the mine at Mt. Tianheng, that is.
Jinwu: They say that indigenous tribes already existed here, gathering the Glazed Sand Crystal and trading completed porcelain products, long before Rex Lapis ever arrived.
Jinwu: Later, these tribes would make blood-pacts with the Lord of Geo's Yaksha and join him, thus becoming the forebears of Shenglu Hall, one of Liyue's Eight Trades.
Jinwu: They also took part in the great battles to subdue Azhdaha and repel the black calamity... They've contributed a lot to Liyue.
Jinwu: See that valley over there to the northwest? They say that it is the trail left over after the Lord of Geo bodily dragged Azhdaha out of The Chasm.
Jinwu: Eventually, they would forsake their tribal lands and ways, and growing used to city life, would join the Lord of Geo in his dwelling, creating and selling porcelains for a living, forsaking their old militant roots.
Jinwu: So yeah, those nitpickers at Shenglu Hall had ancestors who fought alongside Rex Lapis himself! Imagine that!
 Could you tell me more about The Chasm itself?
Jinwu: I was there, you know, when they sealed this place up several years back. The lads down below dug up something truly...
Jinwu: Well, I remember the long line of wounded that were carried back up to the surface, I'll tell you what...
Jinwu: Even spookier yet, the lads who were injured weren't necessarily hurt in the way you'd usually think miners would be. It was more like... spiritual or mental damage, you know?
Jinwu: They'd recover a few days after being brought up to the surface, so there wasn't much serious damage done in the end, but that was enough to get the Qixing to step in.
Jinwu: Doesn't matter what exactly they dug up, but I'll bet you that it was nothing good. The folks at Yujing Terrace reckoned so, too... and so they sealed The Chasm off completely.
Jinwu: Now that sure got Shenglu Hall riled up... though that's a story for another day.
 Tell me about your work...
Jinwu: Me? I manage equipment. Nothing too exciting, mind! I spent the last 20-plus years tinkering with miners' ore-lamps and water filters while other kids went to school, s'all.
Jinwu: (‍Met batch after batch of miners while I was at it. Some of them weren't hardly any older than you when they first went in.Met batch after batch of miners while I was at it.

 Could you tell me about the Seven-Star Array?
Jinwu: That's a little something that the Qixing set up. Tell you what, it certainly bars the righteous, but not the wick... Hahah! Right, just kidding.
Jinwu: Anyway, this array is the highest class of seal in the land as far as governance is concerned. If anyone sees it, they'll know what the consequences of breaking the seal will be, alright.
Jinwu: And that's why the Qixing used these ostentatious Bedrock Keys to anchor the array. Gotta send a message, make a show of force, y'know?
Jinwu: Gotta put the fear of Rex Lapis — or at least the fear of the Qixing's retribution — into the hearts of any thieves who might want to break the seal and steal some stuff.
Jinwu: *cough* In other words, if someone really does break the seals and does not suffer the consequences... It means that they at least have the tacit approval of the Qixing.

Dialogue Set #2[]

(Talk to Jinwu at the exploration camp)
Jinwu: Ah, you're here. What is it? Would you like me to refine your Lumenstone Adjuvant?
