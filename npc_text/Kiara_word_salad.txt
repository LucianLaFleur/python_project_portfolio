Profile[]
Kiara entered Fontaine along with Neuvillette and Carole around 400 years ago. She was not aware of Carole's self-sacrifice.[2]
Kiara would join the Marechaussee Phantom, where she helped solve a smuggling case involving Domenico. Domenico, wanting revenge, decided to send a threat letter to Kiara by proxy via Esseim after his attempt to incite a riot in the Fortress of Meropide failed. Neuvillette caught wind of the threat and not wanting a repeat of Carole's tragedy, decided to investigate the matter himself and discovered the truth of the matter, though everyone would soon be aware of the letter and volunteered to protect her.[3]
In her spare time, Kiara volunteered to model Eloffe's clothes for children from Chioriya Boutique.[2]
Clorinde eventually had Kiara moved to the Palais Mermonia for her own safety, worried that she would be scared by the amount of people willing to protect her. She fell asleep and encountered Carole in her dream, who was delighted to see their dreams become true, though she had forgotten what it was.
