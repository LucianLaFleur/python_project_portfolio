 Because and so...
Media:VO Railah 01.ogg "Because things are so, ergo they are such."

Media:VO Railah All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Railah: (Being deployed to Caravan Ribat is not bad. At least I won't have to deal with those obscure jokes anymore.)

Dialogue[]

Railah: Every result has a reason, and every reason has a consequence.
 Duel
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Railah: As the cause, so the effect. Would you like to try again?
(If the player wins the match)

Railah: What? ...I lost? Hmm, but what is there to complain about anyway...
 Uh...
Railah: Was it too difficult to understand?
Railah: Ah, it's fine. That's what everyone thinks. You're not the first, and definitely not the last.
Railah: It's just like my research. It doesn't matter if I think forward or go backward, the possibilities are always infinite.
 You're carrying out research here?
Railah: Knowledge does not change with the locale, and locale does not change with knowledge.
Railah: Rainforest and desert, permit and prohibition, wisdom and ignorance, life and death... Everything in the world is just like that.
 Sounds reasonable but doesn't quite make sense in the meantime.
Railah: Hahaha, that means you have reached the threshold of wisdom.
Railah: Good, good. You are clever, even better than many scholars.
(Obtain  Guide to Ingenuity)
 See you.
Railah: Goodbye. Farewells and reunions are mutually fulfilling as well.
