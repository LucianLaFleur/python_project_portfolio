Profile[]
Draff, Diona's father and a distant descendant of Olaf, is the head hunter for the village of Springvale. He is a firm believer in sustainability and a capable hunter and leader. However, he is an alcoholic and a known member of the Four Drunkards. His egocentrism and lack of inhibition under the influence of alcohol is remarked on by several other NPCs, and is the reason why Diona despises alcohol so much. There was a point in time, however, when even Draff (at least temporarily) gave up drinking — after Timmie's father, his friend, had his son and decided to become a better role model for him.

Appearance[]
Draff is part of the Kätzlein Bloodline. He has brown hair, cat ears, a beard and a moustache. He carries a bow and an arrow. Draff also has bandages and he is wearing yellowish boots.

Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

(Before completing Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip)
Draff: Traveler? What do you want?
(After completing Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip)
Draff: Traveler, I remember you. I see you've been getting more familiar with our town here.
 Is there anything of note nearby?
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Draff knows; Version 1)

Draff: During our hunt, Allan reported to me that he'd sighted ores nearby that resembled Crystal Ores...
Draff: Just that they had a different color, and were rarer. You'll have to ask Wagner for the specifics, he probably knows far more than me...
Draff: While Crystal Ores don't fall within the purview of our hunts, I did record their positions. They were somewhere around...
Draff: Mm. I've marked them down on your map. Perhaps that will be of some help to you.
(Rich Ore Reserves nearby marked on the map)
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Draff knows; Version 2)

Draff: I remember that while we were out hunting, Allan reported that he'd seen ores nearby that looked like Crystal Ore.
Draff: While Crystal Ores don't fall within the purview of our hunts, I did record their positions. They were somewhere around...
Draff: Mm. I've marked them down on your map. Perhaps that will be of some help to you.
(Rich Ore Reserves nearby marked on the map)
(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Draff knows)

Draff: To a hunter, nothing is more worth noting than the prey. I can't say if anything has made an impression on me otherwise.
 Could you sell me some game you hunted?
Draff: Depends on how much you want... I can sell some of it to you. Anything you get from us directly is going to be fresher than anything you find in the shops.
(Opens Shop menu)
 Who are you?
(Only available prior to completing Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip)
Draff: I am Draff, you can think of me as the head of the hunters. The best hunter in the town.
Draff: Most of meat from our hunts goes straight to the Good Hunter, a restaurant in the city.
Draff: If you're here to make a bulk order of meat, I'm afraid we don't have the capacity to take it on.
 How are things lately?
(After completing Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip)
Draff: Well, what can I say? The last Springvale Cookoff was crowded with nearly the whole town discussing every topic under the sun. The better the conversations, the more meat they eat, you know.
Draff: As head of all the hunters in this town, I guess you could say I'm also the brains behind 'em all too, haha.
Draff: As for my great ancestor, Olaf, his relatives have all succumbed to the grip of time. What a pity...
Draff: When hunting season's over, I should show my respect for my ancestors by going out and drinking with him. It always feels kind of weird to say that...
 Tell me about your family.
Draff: Stay away from my daughter, Diona.
Draff: She will learn the hunting trade from me and take over as leader of this town.
Draff: But right now she's at that rebellious age, and she's gone off to work in the city as a bartender or something...
Draff: *sigh* Never mind, I just need to be patient. She's my daughter after all, and if she's got her heart set on doing something she'll not go back on it easily.
 Goodbye.
Draff: Bye.

Nighttime[]

Draff: Aha, traveler!
Draff: When the hunt is over, it's time to drink to your heart's content! Here, come on...
 Is there anything of note nearby?
Draff: With such fine wine before me, what would I care about what's nearby or anything...
Draff: Oh, don't look so uptight. How about joining me for a mug or two?
 Who are you?
(Only available prior to completing Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip)
Draff: Put it like this — every time you eat meat in the city, you're eating something caught by a Springvale hunter.
Draff: And I am the head of those hunters!
Draff: You could say I'm the man of the house of this whole darn town! Hahaha...
 How's the haul?
Draff: Envious? Well, it's fine. I'm in a good mood right now. There's some leftover meat from our daytime delivery. Take it, take it!
Draff: It's on me, don't worry — but remember, the best meat has to go with the best wine!
(Obtain  Raw Meat ×6)
 You seem to be very happy.
(After completing Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip)
Draff: Of course! Let me put it this way — every time you eat meat in the city, you're eating something caught by a Springvale hunter.
Draff: And I am the head of those hunters!
Draff: You could say I'm the man of the house of this whole darn town! Hahaha...
Draff: Huh? Now where's that great ancestor of mine gone to? Things get a bit fuzzy after drinking so much...
 You seem like you've drunk a lot...
Draff: No good hunting session is complete without a good drinking session afterwards!
Draff: What's more, my daughter Diona is one of the top bartenders in Mondstadt...
Draff: That hasn't changed how much she nags me about my drinking, mind you...
 How long is the hunt over for?
Draff: Until the next hunt, of course! Is that a trick question or something?
 Uh, bye.
Draff: Goodbye! Come early enough next time and there might still be a few drinks left for you! Hahaha!

Event Dialogue[]
Unreconciled Stars[]

(Daytime only)
Draff: We can't afford to lose any more people... Ever since the meteorites struck, it's become increasingly difficult to provide enough meat to fulfill the Good Hunter's orders...
Draff: I do wish that some of the younger hunters could learn to not let their curiosity get the better of them... *sigh*
(Dialogue options and responses are the same as normal)

Of Ballads and Brews[]

(Daytime only)
Draff: Hello, Traveler. There's a big festival going on in Cider Lake, and there's been a lot more tourists in town lately.
Draff: The festival is going well! My daughter is on a break, so I get to spend more time with her.
(Dialogue options and responses are the same as normal)
