Dialogue[]

Salm: Ah, let's try one more time... Kutta, listen to me! Sit!
Kutta: (Sits.)
Salm: Remember what a Sumpter Beast is? A large, rotund creature.
Kutta: Woof!
Salm: And do you remember how many Sumpter Beasts we have?
Kutta: Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof... woof?
Salm: Wrong again! I told you to include the cubs that were born last month.
Kutta: (Wags tail.)
Salm: It's no use wagging your tail at me! Wrong answers will get you no treats.
Kutta: *whimper*
Salm: ...Okay, okay, at least there's been an improvement since the last time. I'll give you a little.
Salm: I envy you sometimes. Your only job every day is running around the Sumpter Beasts. Life is so easy for you...
Salm: Unlike mine. I work day and night to keep these Sumpter Beasts, and whatever profit I manage to make barely covers the loss from those that run away.
Kutta: ?
