 Any work?
Media:VO Duqin 01.ogg "Hello, dear guests! Is there any work that you need done?"

Dialogue[]

Duqin: Do you need some assistance? We bill by the hour, but prices are negotiable. We can support a large number of city guards.
 What do casual laborers do?
Duqin: We specialize in packing and sealing loose goods, and the handling of luggage and large cargo! Efficiency guaranteed!
Duqin: Some foreign visitors don't know how to properly pack their tea leaves and jadeware into their luggage, resulting in damage during transportation...
Duqin: Or they are unfamiliar with the roads of Yilong Wharf and choose the wrong path, resulting in them finding stairs in their way and exhausting themselves...
Duqin: By hiring help like us in advance, you'll avoid lots of trouble!
 Sounds really tough...
Duqin: It's all right. Compared to the guys working as long-distance escorts, we're just moving goods within the city. The work is much less intense, and it's safer too.
Duqin: Of course, some of us aren't official guard material yet, so they're trying to work their way up.
Duqin: The journey from Liyue Harbor to Yilong Wharf is a great ordeal for guards, and you'll never make it without some skill!
 Why do you pay by the hour?
Duqin: Oh! Because it's our part-time job!
Duqin: Our primary job is to assist the guys in the Secure Transport Agencies with the unpacking and distribution of long-distance shipments.
Duqin: However, there aren't that many such long-distance shipments. Since we have nothing else to do between them, why not do some odd jobs and help some foreign visitors?
Duqin: Everyone knows when the next long-distance shipment will be arriving, so our work schedule is quite flexible if we only accept a few hours of work at any one time.
 We'll call if we need your help!
Duqin: Take care then! Who knows? Maybe you'll make a fortune soon, and when the time comes for you to purchase lots of stuff, we'll be there to help!
