Profile[]
At the height of his power, Osial was a powerful god during the Archon War who came to blows with Morax, the God of Geo. He was capable of creating tsunamis as tall as Liyue's mountains.[3] Even after two thousand years of being sealed, Osial was powerful enough to withstand the attacks of three adepti and retaliate to destroy the replica Guizhong Ballistas. At some point in time, Osial "married" Beisht.

Appearance[]
After being reawakened by Childe, he takes the form of a five-headed hydra with a body made of water.

Story[]
History[]
Very little is known about Osial's history. Zhongli refers to their conflict as an "ancient grudge,"[4] suggesting he and Osial had a long-standing enmity for reasons yet known. However, tales of Rex Lapis' victory over the sea monsters have become a much-beloved tale among the people of Liyue.[5] The tale of the battle between Osial and Rex Lapis varies by person, but all Liyue people agree in that Rex Lapis wielded the sacred lance, Vortex Vanquisher, to pierce the rainbow of Osial and pinned him in the center of the deep sea.[6]

Present[]
People who sleep at Guyun Stone Forest have reported reliving Osial's memories of his defeat at Rex Lapis' hands.[2] It is unclear whether this phenomenon stems from Osial's powers, or if it stems from something else.
During "Heart of Glaze," Childe uses the Fatui-manufactured Sigils of Permission to unleash Osial, hoping to lure out the Geo Archon in order to steal his Gnosis. Despite being imprisoned for two thousand years, Osial's strength had not diminished, and he easily shattered the Guizhong Ballistas when the adepti tried to use them. However, the ancient god was defeated and resealed once more after Ningguang dropped the Jade Chamber on it. After defeating him, the Traveler gains a Monolith Fragment, which was part of the spear Morax used to seal it away.
During "A Herald Without Adherents," Dainsleif and the Traveler discover that the Abyss Order plans to use the Defiled Statue, insert the limbs of Osial and the core of the first Field Tiller to make a mechanized god to use to "topple the divine thrones of Celestia".
Beisht, Osial's "wife", became incensed at the Jade Chamber and plotted revenge on the people of Liyue. However, the plan failed as Ningguang had been warned of her presence by Beidou.[7]

Oh, you mean that jumbo-sized octopus from the Sea of Clouds? Uh... not because I wanna eat it or anything, but... if you guys wanted to, you should definitely cook it through on the grill first... Oh, wait! I mean, you don't HAVE to grill it, but... I just think it would taste better that way...
Trivia[]
Two triskelions can be seen along his body in the cutscene where Childe reawakens it.
Osial's original Chinese title uses 魔神 "Demon God", a term for gods preceding the rise of The Seven. The English localization typically translates this term as "God," but it was translated as "Overlord" for Osial instead.
Etymology[]
Following the theme of gods in Genshin Impact being named after demons in the Ars Goetia, Osial (Chinese: 奥赛尔 Àosài'ěr) may be a portmanteau of Ose (Chinese: 欧赛 Ōusài), the 57th demon, and another demon's name:
A common theory, based on the -ial ending of its name, is Belial.
Alternatively, based on the 尔 ěr character in Osial's Chinese name, the second demon may be Furfur (Chinese: 佛尔佛尔 Fú'ěr Fú'ěr), a demon who has control over storms, tempests, lightning, and thunder as one of its traits.
Osial may be inspired by the water god Gonggong (Chinese: 共工 Gònggōng) and his minister Xiangliu (Chinese: 相柳 Xiāngliǔ) in the Chinese mythology.
Gonggong is counted as one of the Four Evildoers and was considered responsible for great floods. His war against a holy emperor to decide who would be the ruler of the universe caused a catastrophic change to the world, including bending the directions of great rivers and the sun. Accounts vary about who defeated Gonggong, but in many cases they are believed to be one of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, a mythological ruler who represents the virtue of the Earth element. These stories match the lore in the game that the Overlord of the Vortex was defeated by the God of Geo, which drastically changed Liyue's landscape and resulted in the formation of Guyun Stone Forest.
Xiangliu is a great snake who has nine human heads and supported Gonggong during the war. He was finally slain by a hero-emperor but his blood tainted a large portion of the land. This legend may have inspired the lore that Osial is allegedly a nine-headed hydra[6] and the hatred of fallen gods plagues Liyue as miasmas.
