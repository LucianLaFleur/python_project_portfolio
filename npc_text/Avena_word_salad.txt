Dialogue[]

Avena: I think I'll go explore over there next!
Lemta: Miss, with all due respect, your adventure plan...
Avena: Yeah, I know. I haven't forgotten! I just want to buy some Sumeru specialties before I set off.
Avena: Come shop with me first, and I'll pay you by the standard of an Adventurer's bodyguard. You won't be underpaid. Trust me.
Lemta: It's not the money. I don't usually carry packages for clients in the downtown area...
Avena: Well, I wasn't fully prepared for this. I came to Sumeru with only diving equipment. Just see this as procuring supplies for my adventure.
Lemta: Fine then...
