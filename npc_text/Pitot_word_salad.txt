Dialogue[]

Pitot: Welcome to The Rusty Rudder. Choose anything you want!
 I want to see what you've got.
Pitot: Please, take your pick. Though you'll have to make an offer if you want to buy the "good wine."

 About Mysterious Xenochromatic Crystals...
(If this is the first visit)

Pitot: Oh, you can't just find this just anywhere. I'm pretty interested in collecting strange and interesting things, so if you're willing to hand it over to me, I'll make sure to compensate you.
Pitot: Sure looks like a good specimen. If you manage to come across any of these things again in the future, do me a favor and bring them to me. I'll compensate you like I did just now.
(Obtain  Mora ×20,000)
(If this is the second visit)

Pitot: Oh, we can use the same rules as before. Once I've confirmed the goods, the pay's yours.
Pitot: Looks good. Always happy doing business with you.
(Obtain  Mora ×20,000)
(If this is the third visit)

Pitot: Same old rules.
Pitot: Excellent. That said, I suppose we probably won't meet again to conduct another one of these happy little transactions.
Pitot: Mysterious things are only mysterious because they're rare. I did buy some Mysterious Xenochromatic Crystals from another adventurer before this. Only saw him three times, though.
Pitot: According to him, he was able to find these things three times — never again. Maybe there's some strange rule of nature at work.
Pitot: If you ask me, we'd best leave some of this world's secrets undisturbed.

Pitot: Hehe, don't read too much into it. It's just a game, after all.
(If the player wins the match)

Pitot: Hey, you're quite something! I haven't met many customers who could beat me before.
 This place is...
Pitot: As you can see, this is a bit of a dingy tavern. I'm the helmsman here, but you can call me Boss. Whatever you want.
Pitot: You can just tell me what you want to drink. I'll do my best to either make it myself, or find it for you.
Pitot: Of course, if you really want me to help find some new goods which aren't on the shelves, then you'll have to pay a little more.
 I need to pay extra Mora?
Pitot: Mora? Heh, if you're only paying in Mora, then I can only sell you what's on the shelves. At most you could have some "good wine."
Pitot: For things that aren't on the shelves, you need to trade something that's not in your wallet.
 Wh—What do you mean?
Pitot: Heh, don't worry about it. Just choose what you want to drink.
 Why are you wearing a divesuit?
Pitot: I've called this here tavern The Rusty Rudder and, as the helmsman, I naturally have to dress accordingly.
Pitot: What's more, it makes it easier for me to dive into the water and fish out any drunk guests who fall in.
Pitot: If they insist on drowning, then let them at least drown in booze. Otherwise, it'd be bad for my tavern's reputation.
 Bye.
Pitot: See you. You want something to drink, just let me know.
