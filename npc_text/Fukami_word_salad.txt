Fukami was a yoriki of the Inazuma Shogunate who likely perished during the cataclysm 500 years ago alongside Fujiki and another yoriki samurai. He was a wielder of an Electro Vision.
When the Traveler and Raiden Ei were investigating rifthounds attacking the roots of the Sacred Sakura, they were led to a cave underneath the Araumi area. When The Shogun began to resist Ei's control over their body, Fujiki, Fukami and the unnamed yoriki manifested. Seeing their Archon in danger, the three quickly sprung into action and defended her from the rifthounds. After telling the Traveler to bring the Shogun back to Inazuma City, they passed on peacefully.

Appearance[]
Fukami wears a lavender shitagi, indigo kobakama, and he is barefoot in waraji sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with dark gold accents consists of dou (breastplate) with the Inazuma Shogunate's crest, han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves). He is also wearing sode (shoulder armor) on his left shoulder. Fukami carries a katana at his hips on the left side with the blade facing down and his Vision on the right side.
