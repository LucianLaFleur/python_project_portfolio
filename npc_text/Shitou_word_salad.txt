Dialogue[]

Shitou: You there, you're looking radiant today, clearly it must be your lucky day!
Shitou: How about it, wanna try your luck betting on jade?
 Do you have anything besides uncut rocks for sale?
Shitou: Sure, have a look! These were all cut from raw stone. Although these aren't exactly rare jade, maybe you'll find something that strikes your fancy.

(If the player loses the match)

Shitou: Hehe. It seems that you have to keep trying. Come again next time!
(If the player wins the match)

Shitou: Not bad, customer. I didn't think you'd be able to pick me apart that easily. Impressive.

(If the player loses the match)

Shitou: Customer, I guess your luck isn't in the cards today. Normally, one'd open an Uncut Stone when they lose. How about one?
(If the player wins the match)

Shitou: Customer, you're pretty lucky. Today is definitely going to be a lucky day. Why don't you buy an Uncut Stone when you're done playing?
 About Rex Lapis' death...
(Unlocks after The Fond Farewell)
Shitou: Alas... I wish him all the best...
Shitou: But feelings are feelings. We must keep on living, yes?
Shitou: Now, I've been thinking — perhaps I should rename that type of Noctilucous Jade used in the Rite of Parting, as a manner of remembering Rex Lapis by.
Shitou: Which do you think sounds better, "Parting Jade" or "Ascending Jade?" I feel like they're about equal...
 Betting on jade?
Shitou: Oh? This is your first time at The Jade Mystery?
Shitou: Here at The Jade Mystery we pride ourselves in our generations of expertise in crafting jade finery. We have quite a reputation in Liyue, even if I do say so myself.
Shitou: Though the industry hasn't been as booming recently. The Ministry of Civil Affairs has shut down the Chasm, cutting off supplies.
Shitou: As such, the raw materials are worth more than the finished goods these days... So I figured, why not sell the uncut rocks off? Betting on them is exciting, and who knows, perhaps I might just make some money.
Shitou: Now all my old card game buddies come here to bet on jade. Business is better than a few other places around here, that's for sure...
 Tell me more about this jade.
Shitou: Never played before, huh? That's rare.
Shitou: These stones were all dug out of the mines. They're generally of better quality. Pick out one that you like and buy it.
Shitou: "He who knows the jade, gets paid."
Shitou: Don't worry about picking a dud one, there's another saying in the industry —
Shitou: "If your luck doesn't come today, it's waiting for you tomorrow!"
 What's the actual probability of finding jade?
Shitou: Well, that's the million Mora question isn't it? But seriously, it would ruin the game if I knew the probability in every case. A game of probability is nowhere near as exciting as a game of chance!
Shitou: And hey — even if there's no jade inside, who's to say you won't find something else instead?
Shitou: I kid you not, just the other day a big business owner comes in here, opens a stone, and sure, no jade, but there's a good few chunks of ore in there. Not good enough for him of course, he gives them right back to me without a second look. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the generosity, I've just got nowhere to store them.
Shitou: So how about you take them? My investment in your future, shall we say — and if you ever want to return the favor, you know where to find my store... hahaha...
(Obtain  Enhancement Ore ×4)
 Gotta go.
Shitou: Leaving just like that? You never know what luck you might be giving up.
