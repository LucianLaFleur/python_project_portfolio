Servan: Hey, wanna see something new?
 Is this another one...?
Servan: Huh? What do you mean by "another one"?
Servan: I have something new here that you've definitely never seen before!
Servan: Look at this! It can be squeezed into various shapes and can stick to the wall. It's slime paste!
Servan: And this one is called "Up, Up, and Away"! Just rub it between your hands and it will rise up into the air!
Servan: How do you like it? Fun, isn't it? Buy it for yourself or bring it back home to your kids, it's all good!
Servan: Hey, d—don't go...
 Bye!
Servan: D—Don't walk away! Let me just give you a quick demo!
