Story[]
Muzzudin was a descendant of the Verdant Lord, Zumurud, who was the son of Muzaffar, one of the Twenty-Nine Deys of Orghana (the city now known as Port Ormos). The inscriptions found around the Great Red Sand seem to contradict each other on Badanah's (and thus also Muzzudin's) ancestry; one inscription claims Badanah was one of Zumurud's fifty sons (assuming the line is meant to be read literally),[1] while another claims that "[Badanah's] father is most beloved of the Verdant Lord," which indicates that Badanah was not Zumurud's direct descendant. Regardless, Badanah and Muzzudin were full brothers,[1] and they had at least another fourteen brothers (or male relatives). Following Badanah's death, Muzzudin and those brothers who would later all make claims to the throne.[2]
A later inscription found south of Abdju Pit is a panegyric which praises king Badanah, and claims that he was wiser than Muzzudin was.
