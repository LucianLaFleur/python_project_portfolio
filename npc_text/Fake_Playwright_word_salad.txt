Dialogue[]

Fake Playwright: Hi, esteemed audience members! I'm Fake Playwright, one of the staff working on Three-Day Reverie. Can I help you with anything?
 Why are you known as "Fake Playwright"?
Fake Playwright: That's a good question! It seems I have some explaining to do.
Fake Playwright: Long story short, if I can't write anything appropriate soon, I'll be fired!
Paimon: Whoa! Is it that bad? You make it sound like... Water Droplets have strict rules too!
 Appropriate? What do you mean?
 Are you referring to impactful dialogue?
Fake Playwright: No, not at all. Dialogue is the easiest part!
Fake Playwright: Writing beautiful lines, fooling the audience into thinking the lines are something profound...
Fake Playwright: That's something any Hydro Eidolon with just a few months of intensive training... No, even a Specter could do that!
Fake Playwright: But to transform a splendid section of the play into the scene before your eyes, now that cannot be done without a careful division of labor and cooperation. That is the essence of being "appropriate"!
 Clear as mud.
 How abstract.
Paimon: Could you explain it in a way that Paimon can understand?
Fake Playwright: No surprise there. It takes a certain amount of creative experience to resonate with this topic.
Fake Playwright: Then I'll slow down enough to give you time to catch up. A good playwright must understand the troupe's limits and resources, and write the script with those in mind.
Fake Playwright: Even if it's the simplest of scenes, you must carefully determine the actors and props required.
Fake Playwright: But as you can see, we plain don't have enough actors and our prop selection is relatively limited as well.
Fake Playwright: So, you certainly can't go overboard when writing the script because once it's in the show, the audience may feel a deep disconnect between what is described and what is shown.
Fake Playwright: My failure to take that into consideration resulted in me writing a few unrealistic and entirely unusable scripts, and it even ended up delaying the schedule of the entire troupe...
 Ouch...
 That's terrible...
Paimon: If worse comes to worst, then... Paimon will just draw figures on wooden boards and use them as actors! Paimon can draw some props on wood too... y'know, signal the audience!
Paimon: Hmm, we can install a few wheels on the bottom and move them around to display character movement or interact with props.
Paimon: If we slam them together and throw in some exaggerated sound effects, we can even recreate fight scenes!
Paimon: It'll be just like when the sea monster's minions showed up in the Black Nacre play!
 Economical showmanship!
 Even Paimon can do it!
Fake Playwright: No! Absolutely not! According to Mr. Zosimos's book, that's on the level of "terribly unforgivable" and should be used for insignificant supporting characters... at best!
Fake Playwright: Instead of leaving a few stand-ins for actors which just stand there chatting loudly all day, it's better to just leave them out completely!
Fake Playwright: Doing that... it only interferes with the audience's imagination, yet fails to fully convey the scene...
Fake Playwright: It's safer to avoid limiting the audience's imagination, and use words alone to lead them through it!
Fake Playwright: ...
Fake Playwright: (Fake Playwright seems to be seriously gesturing and acting out something, but the speaker remains silent.)
Fake Playwright: Ugh! I just don't have the words yet, so many lines haven't been recorded, I can't say them...
Paimon: Fake Playwright seems to be very principled... As soon as we brought up this subject, it just can't stop talking.
 High standards for oneself are a good thing.
 It's better than not seeking to improve.
Paimon: Anyway, let's stop for now. Otherwise, this might go on forever...
Fake Playwright: But perhaps it may not be that difficult for the two of you.
Paimon: That's true! If you think about it, you shouldn't be afraid of creating something just because someone might be harsh on it.
Paimon: Hehe! Looks like (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) and Paimon are talented at this too... Or Paimon should say that we're made of the right stuff, though we haven't really started!
Paimon: Anyway, you talking about this made Paimon curious about something. Did Zosimos actually read that book?
 O Cultured Playwright, can we have a word?
Fake Playwright: I told you, I'm just one of the staff. It's like you're mocking me when you address me like that...
Paimon: Hey! Aren't you being a little too sensitive? That's not what (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) meant! (‍HeHeText for male Traveler/SheSheText for female Traveler‍) is always sincere!
Fake Playwright: Forgive me, being sensitive is something that comes naturally to us artistically gifted playwrights...
Fake Playwright: According to Mr. Zosimos, sometimes people in the industry have been misunderstood or even ruthlessly attacked because they were careless with their wording...
Fake Playwright: While such a demanding audience may not appear in the Veluriyam Mirage...
Fake Playwright: Mr. Zosimos also said that whenever we create something, we must be prepared to receive the attention of a larger audience and never leave it up to luck!
Fake Playwright: Hmm, we may have gone off topic a bit. Though those are more my own personal expectations, you could also consider them suggestions.
Paimon: Those expectations are way too strict! Are you going to quibble over every single little word?
Paimon: So if we create a show based on our own experiences, like the story of the Anemo Archon and Dvalin...
Paimon: Would people come forward just to fuss over things like... Hmm, something like "How disrespectful! How dare you make the Anemo Archon seem so carefree! That's far too presumptuous!"
 Just laugh it off.
 Creative art should be fun, not overly cautious.
Fake Playwright: What? You've ascended to the plane of "transcendence" before you've written a single script!?
Paimon: ?
 ?
Fake Playwright: One of Mr. Zosimos's books mentioned such a concept—
Fake Playwright: "Even if we exercise the utmost care while writing a script, we are bound to encounter many who we would consider are criticizing our work excessively."
Fake Playwright: "If you fear such criticism and dare not fully exercise your creative freedom, then you are putting the cart before the horse..."
Fake Playwright: In short, listen to what is right and ignore the harsh criticism.
Fake Playwright: Such transcendence is of great benefit to writing scripts. It's a realm that all playwrights dream of... It is easy to say such things, but actually doing so is a completely different story.
Fake Playwright: But perhaps it may not be that difficult for the two of you.
Paimon: That's true! If you think about it, you shouldn't be afraid of creating something just because someone might be harsh on it.
Paimon: Hehe! Looks like (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) and Paimon are talented at this too... Or Paimon should say that we're made of the right stuff, though we haven't really started!
Paimon: Anyway, you talking about this made Paimon curious about something. Did Zosimos actually read that book?
 We're here to provide material for you...
Paimon: Daiya's voice said that we should talk to you and tell interesting stories that will help with your script writing!
Fake Playwright: Oh... So Chief Director heard about your adventures from Idyia. Yes, your assistance is necessary...
Fake Playwright: But as you can see, the process of writing a script is very long. I'm worried that your stories will be so rich and detailed that I will fail to remember them after a time.
Fake Playwright: Please use the device in front of me to make a recording. That way I can review it whenever I want!
Paimon: We're experts at that! (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), Paimon will allow you to decide what kind of material we should provide to Daiya's Three-Day Reverie!
After a short discussion with Paimon, you select some of the most outlandish things you've encountered in your journey and the stories from several novels before recording them in a concise and easy-to-understand tone for Fake Playwright...
Fake Playwright: Wow! That's such a long recording! This is more material than I ever expected!
Fake Playwright: I shall specially write a line to extol the great deed you have performed here today in sharing your stories!
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon wonders what kind of show this super professional Water Droplet will turn our stories into!
Paimon: Paimon can't wait!
 Don't mention it. We won't take more of your time.
Paimon: Right! We're only here to observe! We'll leave you to it then!
Fake Playwright: You're so polite and careful with your words! I hope you have a pleasant visit!
