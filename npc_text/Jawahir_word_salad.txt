Dialogue[]

Jawahir: Young one, aren't you a little too lightly dressed? The nights around here can get very cold, so remember to stay warm.
 And you are...
Jawahir: I'm the owner of this store, of course. I sell hand-crafted goods, mostly thin blankets, clothes and some other odds and ends.
Jawahir: When I was young, I worked at the carpet shop in the city... Never thought I'd be using my skills even now!
Jawahir: Not that I hope to make too much Mora this way, but I do hope to make others' lives better.
Jawahir: That said, I haven't been back to the city for a long time, so I have no clue if these designs are still in style.
Jawahir: But people old and young like my handiwork, so I suppose it's fine!
 Thanks for your concern.
Jawahir: Not to worry! Health is the greatest wealth, after all.
