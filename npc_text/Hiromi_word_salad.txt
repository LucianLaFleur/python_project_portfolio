Hiromi's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Hiromi is a Kanjou Commission Officer who wishes to see his childhood friend "Big Sis" (Yan'er) in Liyue again. He is unable to visit her due to the Sakoku Decree, so instead has written her many letters in drifting bottles, which can be found washed up on Dragonspine. He and Yan'er have also been good friends with Shun since they were young.
He appears to have a crush on Yan'er, and upon completing Hiromi's Watch, plans to go on a date with her to Uyuu Restaurant, like mentioned in this letters.
Shun and Yan'er are not too fond of the fact that Hiromi ended up as an Officer, often poking fun at him for it, because they themselves ended up becoming Treasure Hoarders. Hiromi therefore has to keep his friendship with them secret, due to potential punishments he could receive from his superiors in the Shogunate. Shun jokes that Hiromi will come to arrest him, while Yan'er pretends to not know who Hiromi is.

Appearance[]
Hiromi wears a purple-gray shitagi, gray kobakama, white socks, and waraji sandals. His eggplant-colored armor consists of dou (breastplate) with the Inazuma Shogunate's crest, haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves).  He is equipped with a juumonji yari (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead.

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing Transient Dreams)
Hiromi: Hello, outlander. Please don't stay out on the street for too long.
 Why?
Hiromi: Because of the Sakoko Decree. Ritou is not doing well lately, and thieves are running rampant.
Hiromi: You might get into trouble if you stay on the street for too long.
 And you might be...?
Hiromi: My name is Hiromi. As you can see, I work at the commission.
Hiromi: Please abide by the laws in Ritou, or you're going to make my job difficult, too.
 Thanks for the reminder!
Hiromi: Don't mention it, outlander.

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After completing Transient Dreams)
Hiromi: Good day. When strolling through Ritou's streets, please keep your personal belongings safe at all times.
 Why's that?
Hiromi: The Sakoku Decree has been abolished, and the number of people coming to Ritou has increased greatly... and with that, incidents of thievery have also gone up.
Hiromi: As such, I'm making sure to advise those I meet to watch out for their belongings.
 Who are you?
Hiromi: My name is Hiromi. As you can see, I work at the commission.
Hiromi: Please abide by the laws in Ritou, or you're going to make my job difficult, too.
 Thanks for the reminder!
Hiromi: You're welcome.

Dialogue Set #3[]

(After completing Hiromi's Watch)
Hiromi: Hello, Traveler. Do you need help with anything?
 Greetings!
Hiromi: I really appreciate what you did before.
Hiromi: Feel free to come find me if you need help with anything in Ritou. I will try my best to help!
 About your big sister...
Hiromi: She... is not here yet. But since she and I have agreed to meet at Uyuu Restaurant, I'm sure that she will show up.
Hiromi: Anyway, I really appreciate your help. I will cherish the opportunity this time.
 Goodbye.
Hiromi: Goodbye! All the best to you!
