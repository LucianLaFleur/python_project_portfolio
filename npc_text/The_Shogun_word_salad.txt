The Shogun is the second puppet to be made after Ei wanted to create a body which could resist erosion. Her first attempt was Scaramouche, which she deemed a failure because he shed tears upon creation, which made her to believe that he was too fragile for the task. Like him, the Shogun has a consciousness of her own.[7] She is connected to the storms of Inazuma,[8] and wields the sword (Musou Isshin) that houses Ei in battle. The Shogun was created with a set list of rules that cannot be altered or shut off.[8] According to Ei, she does not see the Shogun as an entity separate from herself, claiming that the Shogun counts as a different form of her existence and that she never intended to leave Inazuma in the hands of anybody but herself.[9]
Prior to the Traveler's arrival to Inazuma, the Shogun was manipulated by the Fatui into issuing the Vision Hunt Decree, who had been assisted by the Kujou and Hiiragi Clan after they had been promised power by them. When Kazuha's Friend attempted to challenge her over it with a duel before the throne, the Shogun had Kujou Sara duel him, who won, and per the rules, she executed him with the Musou no Hitotachi.
During the Inazuma Archon Quest series, the Shogun is first seen attempting to confiscate Thoma's Vision after having him captured despite his ties to the Kamisato Clan, one of the three clans forming the Tri-Commission. The Traveler, attempting to intervene, instead gets dragged into the Plane of Euthymia, where Ei defeats and ejects them. The Shogun then tries to execute the Traveler, but the distraction was long enough that Thoma was able to break free from his bindings and threw a spear at her, forcing her to abort as they escaped. She then issued for the Traveler's capture.
After learning the extent of the Fatui manipulation in Inazuma, Kujou Sara attempted to inform the Shogun, but was instead knocked out by La Signora when she arrived. The Shogun chastised her for punishing one of her subjects, decreeing that only she could do so. The Traveler then informed her of the Fatui's plot, though when she did not appear to be convinced, instead issued a duel before the throne. Signora, overconfident in her powers, was defeated by the Traveler and per the rules of the duel, the Shogun moved in to execute her with the Musou no Hitotachi. The Shogun then allowed them to leave the castle grounds alive; upon stepping outside the castle, she emerged to attack them, but Kazuha, who had arrived with the rest of the resistance, managed to parry the attack with his and his friend's Vision. Before the Shogun could attempt to attack the resistance, the Traveler attacked her first, causing them to be brought back to the Plane of Euthymia, where they defeated Ei, who agreed to change her views and attempted to do so to the Shogun.
The Shogun, having been designed to resist change, instead believed that Ei was succumbing to erosion and tried to stop her by refusing to comply with her orders as riftwolves were emerging in Inazuma. Ei, realizing the Shogun was responsible for stopping the body from moving, challenges her inside Makoto's consciousness to prove that she has not been corrupted. As a result of temporal disruption and the Shogun's will, the two dueled for five centuries straight. Ei's new perspectives allowed her to defeat the Shogun, who conceded. She then asked it to serve as her kagemusha, which it accepted.[10]
