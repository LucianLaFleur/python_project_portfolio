Dialogue Set #1[]

(After completing The Culling of the Worms: Introduction)
Vinayak: Brave adventurer, are you ready now?
 I'm ready.
Vinayak: Excellent, excellent! Then let us begin.
(Starts the Introduction & Testing event challenge)
 Not yet.
Vinayak: Alright then. Planning ahead is good for efficiency, after all. But don't spend all your time planning and not executing, like some people.
Shriya: Hey! What's that supposed to mean!? Are you itching for another debate? I'll prove you wrong, I will!

Dialogue Set #2[]

Vinayak: Brave adventurer, are you ready to operate the Wenutslayer Cannon?
 I'm ready.
Vinayak: Alright! Sandstorm's whipping up now. Everyone to your positions!
(Starts the Body & Demonstration event challenge)
 Not yet.
Vinayak: Alright then. Planning ahead is good for efficiency, after all. But don't spend all your time planning and not executing, like some people.
Shriya: Hey! What's that supposed to mean!? Are you itching for another debate? I'll prove you wrong, I will!

Dialogue Set #3[]

(After completing The Culling of the Worms: Conclusion)
Vinayak: If Shriya's hypotheses are correct, this will be the Wenutslayer Cannon's most critical battle. Brave adventurer, are you ready?
 I'm ready.
Vinayak: Alright then, let us begin! Let us prove to all of Sumeru that this cannon isn't just a pretty face!
(Starts the Conclusion & Presentation event challenge)
 Not yet.
Vinayak: Alright then. Planning ahead is good for efficiency, after all...
Shriya: Huh. Is it just me, or has your attitude improved a little?
