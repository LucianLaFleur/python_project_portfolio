Dialogue[]

Baishu: May everyone enjoy good health, booming businesses, rewarding careers, wealth, and success!
 Truly refined! May wealth find you, too!
Baishu: Thank you!
Baishu: Judging by your appearance... You must be a noble! Maybe one who's achieved extreme wealth a long time ago!
Baishu: If you ever decide to expand in Yilong Wharf, you can count on me to help with anything you may need!
 You are?
Baishu: I'm Baishu, the owner of Jiulue Teahouse.
Baishu: Many of the nearby inns are under my name as well. Rest assured, you can leave your food and accommodation in Yilong Wharf to my staff.
 Your business is really prospering!
Baishu: You're too kind! I was merely lucky to ride the wave of industrial upgrading.
Baishu: Once upon a time, I was a very ordinary tea farmer who grew mediocre tea.
Baishu: It's all thanks to the inspiration I received from Master Jiuguan that my fortunes took a drastic change for the better!
Baishu: When the primary tea-making equipment in Chenyu Vale was being upgraded from classic tea cauldrons to machinery, I caught wind and took advantage of that early adoption to accumulate a substantial amount of funds.
Baishu: I started a teahouse with those funds and soon expanded to inns and restaurants.
Baishu: After visiting my teahouses, restaurants, and inns, foreign guests often purchase some tea leaves to try back at home or as a gift.
Baishu: I failed to be an outstanding tea farmer, but I fully intend to provide financial support and publicity to my former colleagues...
Baishu: I'm quite satisfied with where my career's gone now, so my next goal is to help more business people, just like Master Jiuguan!
 (Nod and leave)
Baishu: Your presence is unfathomable! I look forward to meeting you again!
