Profile[]
Viridescent, the Queen of Hunters, was among notable figures who fought against the Abyssal monsters that invaded Teyvat during the cataclysm after the fall of Khaenri'ah. She was brought into the conflict after slaying the monster that had mortally wounded a blind, dying boy. Taking up his last request to enact revenge on the monsters in his place, she abandoned her former way of life and became a feared monster hunter.[1]

Story[]
Viridescent was orphaned at a young age and was raised in the woods by Viaghara, who taught her how to live with nature and how to hunt. She killed solely for the sake of survival and believed that at the end of her life, as long as she abided by the natural order, she would one day arrive at an endless viridescent plain.[2] Having been raised away from human society, Viridescent was unable to speak human language, but was particularly astute at blending in with nature.
Viridescent's way of life was interrupted by the cataclysm. Greater Lord Rukkhadevata died during the disaster, causing the grass and the trees to "never speak again," while monsters of the Abyss began invading Teyvat.[1] A certain blind boy got lost in the forest while pursuing the trail of his white-armored brother.[3][4] The boy discovered a relic of the forest,[3] a bow made with white branches now known as Hunter's Path, which he gave to Viridescent. However, he was fatally injured by the monsters and Viridescent encountered him as he lay dying. For the first time, she killed not for survival, but as revenge for what they had done to him.[5] At his request, she embarked on the path of vengeance against the monsters and the suffering they caused.[1][4]
Having departed from the hunter's rule of killing only for the sake of survival and not for mortal reasons such as justice or revenge, Viridescent believed she would no longer be able to enter the endless plain at the end of her life. However, she remained undeterred and continued her path of vengeance, though she left behind her original bow, The Viridescent Hunt, so it would not be tainted by her quest.[2]
During her quest to slay monsters, Viridescent underwent erosion, forgetting about her original reason for fighting and even the blind boy himself. Tainted by the black blood of the beasts she slew,[6] she became more and more beastlike herself. The Bloodstained Knight eventually found her on his westward journey and, seeing her as a monster, killed her.[4]
