Dialogue[]

Habachi: Unauthorized personnel are prohibited from entering the warehouse.
 What's the deal with this warehouse?
Habachi: As the name indicates, this is where we store goods that fall under the public trust here in Aaru Village. There's nothing else to be said about it.
Habachi: But if you keep asking me these questions, don't blame me for suspecting you of ulterior motives.
 Well, I'll leave you to it.
Habachi: As well you should.
