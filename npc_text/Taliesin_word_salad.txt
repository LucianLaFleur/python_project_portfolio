Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering.


Taliesin: Hmm... no, no. That's not how that goes. According to the genealogy...
Taliesin: Ooh? Oh! Hello, sorry, didn't see you there!
 You...
 I'm...
(Aether version)
Taliesin: Shh! Shh! Ahem! He comes, he comes! His sword shining like the moon so silver, at his footsteps even armies shiver! He is—
(Lumine version)
Taliesin: Shh! Shh! Ahem! She comes, she comes! Her eyes bright as the moon inimitable, her armor formidable, invincible! She is—
Paimon: Blon—die—!
 What!?
 Paimon!
Paimon: Hehe... Sorry, force of habit. It just slipped out, y'know?
 What sort of habit is that, seriously...
 That lacked creativity in the extreme.
Paimon: Hmm, Paimon supposes that the nickname could be uglier...
 Hey!
Taliesin: Hahahaha! Well said, good Paimon, well said!
Taliesin: (‍HeHeText for Aether/SheSheText for Lumine‍) is the golden-haired (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!
 I object to these terrible-sounding, non-consensual appellations.
Taliesin: Apologies, apologies... I did not mean to offend. But more "old-school" poets from Mondstadt do tend to begin like that.
 "Old-school"?
Taliesin: Well, if you'll let me clarify, I don't mean old-school folksongs like the "Dandelion Madrigals" or old-school romances like "Marriage, You Cheat, How I Hate Thee"...
Taliesin: I'm referring to old-school historical epic poetry.
 And what might that be?
Taliesin: Ah, simply put, it is the adaptation of heroic genealogies, the adding of flesh and skin atop the skeletal frame of history!
Taliesin: These epics sing of history through long-form poetry, awakening people to the knowledge of times past. Well, there you have it — the epic, and its value to society.
Taliesin: The ability of poetry to awaken historical consciousness was precisely why it was banned all those years ago by the aristocracy.
Taliesin: They feared that we would recall our former freedom and our history of resistance.
Taliesin: And that is why I despise the popular poetry of the day and seek to revive these "old-school epics."
 I see. Bye.
Taliesin: Um, right, then. See you, golden-haired (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Tell a Tale for Taliesin.


Taliesin: Sorry, I'm a little dizzy at the moment, but I can take it! Ugh...
 What is it you're doing here?
Taliesin: I consider myself a bard of the old school, so of course I'm here to get some inspiration.
Taliesin: That said, I've never gone down into a mine before... and in my hurry to get here, I wound up... pulling a muscle.
Taliesin: Ow ow ow...
 I won't disturb you, then.
Taliesin: Ah, yeah, if you come across any new stories, do tell me!
