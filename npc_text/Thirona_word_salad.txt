Media:VO Thirona 01.ogg "I really hope I can get into the Marechausee Phantom..."

Dialogue[]

Thirona: Heh! If Granna wants to join the Marechaussee Phantom someday, I guess I need to do my best too... Well, just a little bit...
 Why do you want to join up?
Thirona: Well, if I had to mention something, I don't really want to... That's more Granna's line of thought.
Thirona: She's a bit impulsive and rough around the edges when doing stuff, and she's very competitive — but that's what's cute about her, you know?
Thirona: I'd be quite worried for her if she really did manage to join, though.
Thirona: As such, if she wants in, then I want in along with her.
 I wish you success.
Thirona: Haha. Well, I think wishing her success might be a better place to start...
