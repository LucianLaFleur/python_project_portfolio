Idle Quotes[]

 Perfect lighting...
Media:VO Hermosa 01.ogg "The lighting was perfect when I took these photos."

Dialogue[]

Hermosa: These photos are all pretty good... I guess I'll ask the editors to take their pick.
 Are you a photographer?
Hermosa: I'm afraid not. I'm good at photography, yes, but I prefer the title "adventurer".
Hermosa: I take my cat on various adventures and take many photos that tell a story.
Hermosa: I mean, who says pictures can't tell stories? Some of these get published in the newspapers, and some get used as illustrations for books.
Hermosa: Each one of my pictures will definitely contain my cat — makes them easy to identify, you know.
 See you.
Hermosa: Hmm? Oh, yeah, bye.
