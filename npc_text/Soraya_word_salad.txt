Profile[]
I refuse to back down before people who treat history, and its relics, like trash.—Soraya, The Lost Relic
Soraya is a researcher from the Sumeru Akademiya who holds a great interest in Liyue's history and in particular, the legacy of Guizhong, the Lord of Dust and one of the gods who once lived in the Guili Assembly.[1] She holds great respect for history and, as such, associates with people who have intimate knowledge of it. She holds the Treasure Hoarders in great disdain, seeing their plundering and looting of ancient relics for petty cash as sacrilegious. She believes that relics should be for scholars to study, for artists to take inspiration from and for people to admire in an exhibition, not used for earning cash, which is why she holds a low opinion of Treasure Hoarders.[2]

Appearance[]
Soraya wears a dark green-blue robe with a gold necklace and black sandals. She has brown hair tied in a bun and brown eyes, and wears a pair of black glasses.

Story[]
While traveling through Guili Plains, the Traveler encounters Soraya amidst the ruins and learns about Guizhong, the Lord of Dust, from her. The Traveler explores the area and brings back transcriptions of writings found within the ruins, which Soraya then puzzles together to uncover Guizhong's Four Commandments.[1][3]
After encountering Alrani, another student from Sumeru Akademiya, the Traveler learns that Soraya was one of Alrani's classmates and is held in high esteem by the other girl.[4] The antiques seller Linlang mentions asking her about the Nameless Treasures, while an anonymous message on the Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board, likely Zhongli's, refers to her as a "scholar friend from Sumeru," with whom the author spoke about a wide variety of topics at great length. Soraya has also discussed the past and present as well as her research with Zhongli.[5] She has a pessimistic view that humanity will inevitably destroy itself, if not for the "wisdom and mercy" of the gods, whereas he is more optimistic about mortal capabilities and agency.[6]
In the Box of Gadgets version of The Lost Relic, Soraya is attacked by Treasure Hoarders while protecting a jade plate which records a clash between two groups during the Archon War, but is rescued by the Traveler. After hearing why they were in the area — to find a certain relic for Bao'er — Soraya concludes that the woman is actually a high-ranking Treasure Hoarder. She eventually verifies her conclusions and, in A Little Raid, sends the Traveler to deal a little punishment on the Treasure Hoarders for disrupting the precious ruins, although Bao'er was not among them.
During the Traveler's first Lantern Rite Festival, they accompany Soraya on a trip to investigate the legend of the adeptus Skybracer, who was being commemorated in that year's Lantern Rite. After taking a look at the soil sample of Mt. Tianheng the Traveler brings her, she concludes that there is no evidence of Skybracer's antlers being present in the soil, which she believes would have been a logical finding if the legend was true.[7]

Dialogue[]

(After completing Treasure Lost, Treasure Found)
Soraya: Wow, are you a traveler? Have you made any weird and wonderful discoveries recently?
 Who are you?
Soraya: I am a scholar from Sumeru. My name is Soraya.
Soraya: I know that each of the seven nations in this world have unique and rich cultures, but what fascinates me the most is the legends of the Liyue adepti.
 How are your travels through Liyue going?
Soraya: Great! The ruins and history are fascinating, as are the local customs.
Soraya: I mean, a lot of local customs are also derived from history. I've learned a lot just from studying them.
Soraya: Take, for example, this particular record of Liyue wedding customs, which was written about in Customs of Liyue: Flower Ball by a scholar from Sumeru.
Soraya: If it interests you, do take it and have a look. It's very fascinating indeed.
(Customs of Liyue: Flower Ball is added to the Book Archive)
 Goodbye.
Soraya: Bye then. If you hear any interesting stories, do share them with me next time we meet.
