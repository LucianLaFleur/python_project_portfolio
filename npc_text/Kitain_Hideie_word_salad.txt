Kitain Hideie (Japanese: 喜多院秀家 Kitain Hideie), also known as the last Prefect of Yashiori,[1] was a historical figure in Inazuma. He was the last member of the Kitain Clan, who was believed to have went missing or died during the expedition to fight in the cataclysm.[2] In truth, he abandoned his mission and became a wandering fugitive for several decades before ultimately embarking on a long journey to find the Veluriyam Mirage, where he made a dying wish and entrusted the Shinrou Casket to Idyia in his last moments.[3][4]

Kitain Hideie was the last descendant of the Kitain Clan. His mother was once a shrine maiden in Inazuma, and she gave him the Shinrou Casket that she brought from Mouun Shrine when he was summoned far abroad as the Prefect of Yashiori, hoping that it might alleviate the pain he would suffer in battle. At the time, Hideie did not believe that he would need to use it.[3]
During the cataclysm 500 years ago, Hideie accompanied the Raiden Shogun to the northern desert of Sumeru — Khaenri'ah — on their journey to fight the disaster, carrying the Shinrou Casket with him. Hideie was traumatized by his time on that battlefield, especially after a friend sacrificed himself to save Hideie from Riftwolves. Hideie abandoned his men and the cross-shaped spear of the Kitain Clan and fled the battlefield, becoming a wandering fugitive. Afterwards, Hideie felt guilty for having brought shame and tarnished the reputation of his ancestors. He felt that he could no longer return to Yashiori Island after his disgraceful act. He frequently had nightmares about the horrific battlefield and the tragic fate of his friend, and blamed himself for betraying the trust of the Shogun. The illusions conjured by the Casket were his only source of comfort.[3]
In his old age, Hideie decided to seek absolution to end his guilt.[3] He learned about a Domain that could grant wishes, and became determined to return to the battlefield he had once abandoned, save his friend, and follow the Shogun to the very end. He traveled far through the desert and managed to enter the newly established Veluriyam Mirage. He begged Idyia to send him back to the past, not understanding that the Mirage could not actually do so. Idyia intended to explain this to him, but she noticed that the elderly Hideie was in severely poor health after his journey. As a result, she chose to use the Mirage to recreate the battlefield from Hideie's mind within the bottle, granting his final wish. Before Hideie passed away, he faced the battlefield with a smile on his face.[1][4]
