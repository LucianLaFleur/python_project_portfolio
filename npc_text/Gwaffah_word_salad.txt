According to Jeht, Gwaffah and Babel were "eyesores" to one another, though the exact reasons for their discord are never specified. Babel ordered Jeht to kill him, which she did with the jawbone of a Sumpter Beast.[1] Gwaffah's name appears struck out on the Crumpled Namelist in Jeht's tent in the Tanit Camps.
