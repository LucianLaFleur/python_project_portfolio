Profile[]
Menogias was among those who answered Morax's summons to aid his fight against the demons that spawned from the remains of defeated gods during and after the Archon War. Of the many yakshas, Menogias was one of the five strongest alongside Bosacius, Bonanus, Indarias, and Alatus.[3]
Xiao mentioned that Menogias had a hobby of designing intricately beautiful clothes.[4] Rex Lapis was notably quite fond of Kapisas' designs and collected many for his own wardrobe, including the suit he wears in his mortal form today. One of Bosacius' memories during Only Old Memories Remain shows Menogias attempting to convince Bosacius to wear a purple robe. It can be assumed that he was unsuccessful, as Bosacius is never shown actually wearing it.
This hobby is expanded upon by a recollection from Xianyun. She says that he once made Bonanus a dress that she secretly complained was too long for her to use in battle. When Xianyun asked him about this, he said that the train of the skirt would serve to enhance her adeptal countenance by exemplifying a certain elegance. She also said that he was pretty stubborn about the topic of clothing that not even Rex Lapis himself could change the yaksha's mind.[5]
Menogias eventually succumbed to karmic debt and perished. He is implied to have died in a battle against Bonanus.

Etymology[]
Menogias' English title, General Kapisas, is derived from कपीश Kapīśa, lit. "Monkey God", one of the names of the Hindu god Hanuman.
Menogias' Chinese title, 心猿大将 "General Xīnyuán," lit. "General Mind-Monkey," is derived from the Buddhist term monkey mind, used to describe someone who is capricious, restless, and cannot be contained. It is often associated with, and embodied by, the mythological figure Sun Wukong, who was a monkey born from a rock.
