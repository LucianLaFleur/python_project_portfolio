Profile[]
Ikuhara Gai invented the Ikuhara Art forging technique. He was originally a swordsmith at Tatarasuna, but an accident with the Mikage Furnace caused him to leave. Since he doesn't want to leave forever, he joined the Shogun's Army as a blacksmith so he can observe the situation in Tatarasuna from afar.

 Still no good...
Media:VO Ikuhara Gai 01.ogg "*sigh* These materials are still no good for sword making."

Dialogue[]

Ikuhara Gai: *sigh* Just look at this. How can you make a great sword from this scrap? This is an utter waste of my Ikuhara Art forging techniques!
 Is there anything of note nearby?
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Ikuhara Gai knows; Version 1)

Ikuhara Gai: Lately, some soldiers came over to tell me that they found some areas nearby from which ore can be mined, and that they even saw some rare Magical Crystal Ores.
Ikuhara Gai: As for those, well... Magical Crystal Ores are pretty high-quality stuff, alright. But it's hard to make weapons from them, so they're of little use to me.
Ikuhara Gai: I'd put them as having been around here, and I'll help you mark them out. Go check them out if you're interested.

(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Ikuhara Gai knows; Version 2)

Ikuhara Gai: Some troops told me recently that there are some ore mining veins around here.
Ikuhara Gai: That said, though, I'm not really convinced of the quality of anything that isn't Jade Steel.
Ikuhara Gai: I'd put them as having been around here, and I'll help you mark them out. Go check them out if you're interested.

(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Ikuhara Gai knows)

Ikuhara Gai: This is a military camp, what's there that isn't noteworthy?
Ikuhara Gai: Still, it's been relatively peaceful around these parts lately — no real flare ups and all. I hope it stays that way...
 What's the Ikuhara Art?
Ikuhara Gai: The Ikuhara Art is a newly-founded forging style. Our founder... Well, you're looking at him!
Ikuhara Gai: I used to be a swordsmith at Tatarasuna. Then an accident occurred at the Mikage Furnace. Many of my colleagues have since left.
Ikuhara Gai: I don't want to leave yet. That's why I joined the Shogun's Army stationed here. I can serve the Shogunate while observing the situation in Tatarasuna.
Ikuhara Gai: After all, the best sword-forging material, Jade Steel, is produced here in Tatarasuna... If you don't have good materials to use as a basis, then no amount of skill will make it easy for you to forge the finest blades.
 Do you really have to use Jade Steel from Tatarasuna?
Ikuhara Gai: Hey, are you listening to yourself? ...Forget it, you're an outlander. You wouldn't understand.
Ikuhara Gai: The reason why swords from Inazuma are so famous is because of Jade Steel. Swords forged it [sic] are tough and durable, yet extremely sharp.
Ikuhara Gai: Many samurai and swordsmen in our history made their names using weapons forged from Jade Steel.
Ikuhara Gai: Someday, I will use the finest Jade Steel and the forging techniques of the Ikuhara Art to create the best sword in the world!
 I hope you succeed.
Ikuhara Gai: Thank you for your kind words. I won't give up.
Ikuhara Gai: Recently, I collected some decent ores. There were some leftovers, so if you need them, feel free to take them.
(Obtain  White Iron Chunk ×5)
 Goodbye.
Ikuhara Gai: Goodbye. I'd better go find some proper materials.
