Story[]
According to Ranjit, Kuntur was "an unlucky fellow" in Natlan, who "became the target of the sun's hatred due to a mistake his father made". He was called "Kuntur, Unloved of the Sun" and ostracized by his tribe, and Saurians, who would not "buddy up" with him. Kuntur "proved that he was the equal of any valiant warrior in the tribe through hard work and grit", "earning the recognition of an Iktomisaurus comrade, but also becoming a hero to his tribe".[1]
