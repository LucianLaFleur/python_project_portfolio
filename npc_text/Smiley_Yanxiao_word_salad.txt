Smiley Yanxiao's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Smiley Yanxiao was once a thief who attempted to steal from the boss of Wangshu Inn where he was beaten up and locked in. After getting bailed, Yanxiao became a chef in Wangshu Inn, a job which he finds better than being a thief. He is one of Liyue's more prominent cooks, having given Wangshu Inn a strong reputation for the food he serves.
When Moon Carver tasks the Traveler with seeking out Xiao at Wangshu Inn, they learn that he would only appear if he was offered a serving of Almond Tofu. This was normally made by Yanxiao, but he was too terrified to step into the kitchen after a traveler told him of a ghost haunting the inn, and sometime afterwards, saw something moving in the kitchen. The Traveler and Paimon confirm the presence of a ghost and convince her to stop haunting the inn, after which he makes them a serving of Almond Tofu. 
During an iteration of the Masterful Chefs, Yanxiao competed against Xiangling, but lost to her on a small margin. He was not dismayed by the loss, having learned a lot from the competition.
Following a Lantern Rite that saw numerous customers come into the inn, Yanxiao accidentally burns himself while handling the large amount of orders. This resulted in Huai'an looking for a temporary chef so Yanxiao could recover, which the Traveler answers. Yanxiao assists the Traveler with handling orders from particularly picky customers and hands them the recipe to make it as a reward for their help.

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Wangshu.


Smiley Yanxiao: What do you think you're doing? You can't just waltz into the kitchen whenever you feel like it!
 Wh-Who are you?
Smiley Yanxiao: I am Yanxiao, a sous-chef.
Smiley Yanxiao: Unless you have something seriously urgent to tell me, you'd better get out of my kitchen.
 ...Just a sous-chef?
Smiley Yanxiao: What's the big deal? Didn't you see me chopping meat and making a soup?
Smiley Yanxiao: You're not the first person to show surprise at me working as a chef though.
Smiley Yanxiao: My story goes like this. I actually used to be a thief until I stole from the boss.
Smiley Yanxiao: I took a beating for it and was locked up for a while.
Smiley Yanxiao: After I got out, the boss took me on to help out in the kitchen.
Smiley Yanxiao: I find I'm much happier as a sous-chef than I was as a thief.
Smiley Yanxiao: I feel like this is the real me.
 Bye-bye.
Smiley Yanxiao: See you later. Wait no — don't come back in here!
Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Wangshu.

Smiley Yanxiao: Huh? What are you doing just sauntering on into the kitchen?
 Oh, sorry...
Smiley Yanxiao: It's fine. Kindness should be repaid in kind and however it goes.
Smiley Yanxiao: I'm hardly about to kick you out, not after you helped me with that ghost problem and all.
 Tell me a bit about your life to date.
Smiley Yanxiao: What're you asking that for? Aren't you here to cook?
(Rest of the dialogue is the same as "...Just a sous chef?" from the second line onward)
 How've things been going lately?
Smiley Yanxiao: Pretty good. Ever since then, I've stopped seeing anything weird.
Smiley Yanxiao: But even if something pops up again, I'll be fine. The boss met an exorcist called Chongyun through some friends.
Smiley Yanxiao: If another ghost pops up, we'll call him in. Besides, they say he's pretty good at his job.
 Bye-bye.
Smiley Yanxiao: Go well, eat well.

Event Dialogue[]
Moonlight Merriment[]

(After completing Part II: Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go)
Smiley Yanxiao: I might not have won this iteration of Masterful Chefs, but I definitely learned a lot from the competition itself!
Smiley Yanxiao: I was just planning to invent a few new dishes for the Moonchase Festival and maybe learn a few things from Chef Xiangling, but I sure learned quite a few unexpected things, too!
Smiley Yanxiao: ...Actually, what are you doing, just sauntering on into the kitchen again?

Receiver of Friends From Afar[]

Smiley Yanxiao: Oil, salt, sauce, vinegar... Right, that's everything we need.

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
While the English version added the nickname "Smiley" to make a satire more visible, his name Yanxiao (Chinese: 言笑 Yánxiào) literally means "talk and laugh." The word dates back to ancient times as seen in "[we] chatted and laughed harmoniously" (Chinese: 言笑晏晏 yán xiào yàn yàn), a line of a poem collected in the Classic of Poetry (11th to 7th centuries BC), the oldest extant collection of Chinese poetry.
