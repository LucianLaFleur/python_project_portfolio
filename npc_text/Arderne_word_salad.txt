Dialogue[]

Arderne: The healthier you are, the better you can work, right?
 And you are?
Arderne: I'm a doctor. If you have any minor ailments or injuries, I'm your man. As for major ailments and injuries... I'll do what I can, but I'm not making any promises.
Arderne: If you're fatigued from work, you can rest in the infirmary. You can't hear the loudspeaker there, which is good for your mental health.
 About the secret to staying healthy...
Arderne: Early to bed, early to rise. Eat healthy foods. Moderate exercise. Take care of your mental health and stay in good spirits.  It's a shame there's the Fortress of Meropide doesn't get much sunshine...
 Thanks for your time.
Arderne: Stay healthy.
