 So sleepy...
Media:VO Camden 01.ogg "I'm so sleepy... Why am I so sleepy all the time?"

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing An Eye for an Eye.


Camden: This isn't a place to be wandering about. If you don't have any business here, get out.
 Adventure Challenge
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Camden: Such exciting duels don't come knocking too often round these parts. I'm not feeling so sleepy anymore, thanks to you!
(If the player wins the match)

Camden: *yawn* Lost, as expected. Now I'm even sleepier...
 About the Geode Mine Shaft...
Camden: *yawn* Sorry, I'm a bit tired. I think it's because of the stones... Have you ever heard anyone talk about how they have a mysterious energy?
Camden: I don't know what the Fontaine Research Institute engineers do with the stones. But they form here, looking like that. Just thinking about them makes me sleepy...
Camden: If... If you can avoid it, don't go over there. Otherwise I'll need to write a report... *yawn*
 About the middle gearwheel...
Camden: Oh, that... That's, uh, an old issue from way back when.
Camden: Just don't go touching it. I don't want my whole world to start spinning while I'm enjoying a proper snooze...
Camden: Heh. I just mean, if you do move it make sure you don't accidentally trap anyone. It's happened before.
Camden: Not that creatures like humans will ever learn from their mistakes, of course.
 Okay. See you.
Camden: Good night... Uh, I mean goodbye.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing An Eye for an Eye.


Camden: Oh, it's you! *cough* This isn't a place to be wandering about. If you don't have any business here, get out.
 Adventure Challenge
(Same as above)
 About the Geode Mine Shaft...
Camden: Clynes' device isn't as useful as he claims it is... But there are four of you.
Camden: In that case, it would be best if I knew nothing about any of this. In fact, it must be something I dream up while sleeping in my lovely soft bed.
Camden: *cough* Estienne wrote the incident report. I don't know what happened. I just found a new place to take a beautiful nap.
 About the middle gearwheel...
Camden: Oh, that... That's, uh, an old issue from way back when.
Camden: Just don't go touching it. I don't want my whole world to start spinning while I'm enjoying a proper snooze...
Camden: And if something does go wrong I can't act like I didn't see anything this time. I mean, I'm right here.
Camden: And if say [sic] I didn't see anything, that would prove I've been sleeping on the job. I hope you can understand.
 Okay. See you.
Camden: Good night... Uh, I mean goodbye.
