Rene de Petrichor[2] was a Fontainian historical figure from the cataclysm 500 years ago. The son of the then-mayor of Poisson, Renault de Petrichor,[2] Rene is best known for researching Khaenri'ahn technology at the Girdle of the Sands, Sumeru.[3] He is also a close friend and likely the adoptive older brother of Jakob Ingold, and the founder of Narzissenkreuz Ordo.
Rene has history with many of the other notable factions before and after the cataclysm era, such as Poisson, the Narzissenkreuz Institute, and the Institute of Natural Philosophy.

Profile[]
Rene is a child prodigy. In his young age, he deduced the "world-formula" through reverse-engineering the data left by Khaenri'ah.[4] Rene seems to only acknowledge the intellect and talent of Alain Guillotin, looking down upon the intelligence of others. For instance, in his investigation notes and Enigmatic Pages, he mentions that "adults are too pedantic," the members of the Institute of Natural Philosophy have limited imagination, and the plans of the ancients are "anti-intellectual and counter-intuitive."
However, despite Alain's disbelief in the "world-formula" and his rejection of Rene and Jakob's requests,[5][6] the relationship between them ruptured due to the accident involving Carter,[7] even when Alain defeated Rene (as a part of Master) within Elynas' remnants,[8] Rene did not blame Alain. He believed that it was merely because Alain had not witnessed the apocalypse views that Rene and other Ordo members had seen. After Rene's rebirth as the Master, he still seeks cooperation with Alain and aims to prove his "world-formula" to him.[9][10]
Nasejuna calls Rene an "excellent scholar of ancient histories," and uses Rene's Investigation Notes as a basis for his exploration of Khaenri'ahn ruins.[11] During his investigations, Rene drew similarities between the power of Khvarena and a censored word,[4] likely meant to be the Abyss,[12] and "discovered knowledge that 'surpasses mortals'."[11]

History[]
Childhood[]
Rene was born as the son of Renault de Petrichor, Mayor of Poisson, before the Siege of Poisson. At some point in his childhood, he met Jakob and the two became friends. Before the Siege of Poisson got worse, Karl Ingold took a photo of Rene and Jakob along with other figures such as Jakob's biological father Eduardo Baker, Renault and Parsifal the Great. During his time, the siege was soon stopped by the Marechaussee Phantom.[13]
During the siege, both Renault and Eduardo may have died. This led to both Rene and Jakob being taken in by the Narzissenkreuz Institute, where they met Alain and Mary-Ann. During his times there, Rene often played as the "dragon" while Alain played as the heroic "knight".[8][14]

Later life[]
After it became evident that Lyris, the Director of the Narzissenkreuz Institute, and Basil Elton, the vice-director, would never return, the Narzissenkreuz Institute disbanded. Emanuel Guillotin took in Alain and Mary-Ann as his children while Jakob was taken in by Karl Ingold. Rene was most likely also taken in by Karl.[Note 1]
Karl, Rene, and Jakob travelled to the Girdle of the Sands and studied the Harvisptokhm's Gaokerena, which contained the consciousness of the former Hydro Archon, Egeria. Rene realized that its composition was similar to his and Jakob's bodies. Rene's research gained the suspicion of Karl, who was there accompanying Rene and Jakob.
While investigating Elynas' remains, Jakob and Rene coincidentally encountered Alain, Mary-Ann, and Emanuel Guillotin, who were gathering research of their own for Alain's project at the Institute of Natural Philosophy.[15] Although they were elated to see their old friends again, Rene was wary of Emanuel due to his involvement in the Siege of Poisson and did not reveal Jakob's secret to the Guillotin siblings.[16] Afterwards, Alain recommended Jakob and Rene to the Institute's director (who was likely Dwight Lasker).[15]

The Narzissenkreuz Ordo[]
After Rene finished his research, he then formed the Narzissenkreuz Ordo after seeing the people at the Institute of Natural Philosophy turn into "believers". He decides to make them join the Ordo to give them a sense of belonging.[7] At that time, Jakob could now transform into an Iniquitous Baptist, while Carter was still unconscious from the experiment, though he partially showed some signs of life.
At some point in time, Rene conducted an experiment on Carter Scherbius, who was Alain's assistant, in an attempt to "save his life". This experiment created a rift between Alain and Rene along with Jakob.
Soon, Lyris joined the Ordo. Though she was apprehensive, Rene successfully received Lyris' consciousness. Finally, Rene dissolves himself first by merging her consciousness together with his, eventually creating the Master.[1]

Legacy[]
Following the creation of the Master, figures such as Emanuel Guillotin and Marfisa were absorbed by him. However, the Master still had the memories of Rene. He then remembers the "world-formula" and calculates with it to create the Doomsday Clock, which can be currently found at The Narzissenkreuz Ordo, the place with the same name where the Ordo gathered. The Doomsday Clock tells the time of when the "apocalypse" will come to Teyvat.[17]

Trivia[]
Rene is likely to be inspired by René Descartes, a French philosopher, scientist, and mathematician.
Rene is also likely to be inspired by René Iché, a French sculptor who was a very good friend of Max Jacob a French symbolism and surrealist painter.
René Iché once quoted: "On the manure of the Millennia after geological cataclysms and warlike disasters, only the statues will remain."
Rene named the Scarlet Quartz[7] and the Rifthound[18] species.
In Mary-Ann's story, there is a mentioned character from the Narzissenkreuz Adventure Team named Ney, whose name is derived from Rene.
Etymology[]
Rene, or René, is a French masculine name derived from the Latin renātus, meaning "reborn."
The meaning of the name ties with how Rene was "reborn" as the Narzissenkreuz.

Notes[]

↑ There are currently no signs indicating that Rene changed his surname to Ingold. Rene refers to Karl as "Mr. Karl" and 卡尔叔叔 "Uncle Karl" in Chinese. He also refers to Emanuel as "Uncle Guillotin."
