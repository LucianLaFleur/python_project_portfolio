Profile[]
Rigas is part of the Beret Society and is Dougier's subordinate. Being one of the more "docile" and obedient members, Rigas along with Aucelet and Boulmier was sent to greet Wriothesley and the Traveler to put on a performance and make the Beret Society look good. Rigas is the one who talked to the Traveler about taking a deep breath to be happy. Later it is found out that Rigas was following a script. When the Traveler confronted Rigas later, Rigas was paralyzed, not knowing how to act.[1]
