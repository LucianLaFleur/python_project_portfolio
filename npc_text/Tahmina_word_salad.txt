Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Lila: *sob* ...The doctor is a meanie, grandma! The shot she gave me hurt!
Tahmina: No, she's not a meanie but an agent for Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.
Tahmina: Lila is an unwell little tree, and she is nourishing you, little tree.
Lila: I know Rukkhadevata is good, so the doctor is good too?
Tahmina: Yes. Listen to her and you'll grow tall and strong.
Tahmina: Otherwise, the Eremites will take you away for defying Rukkhadevata!
Lila: No, the Eremites are scary, I don't want that...

Tahmina: You're like an unwell little tree, Lila. What the doctor is doing is nourishing you.
Lila: I know the Dendro Archon is a good person... Does that mean that the doctor is a good person too?
Tahmina: Yes. Listen to her and you'll grow tall and strong.
Tahmina: Otherwise, the Eremites will take you away for defying the Dendro Archon!
Lila: No, no! They're scary, I don't want that...
