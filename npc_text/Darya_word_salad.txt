Dialogue[]

Darya: Isn't the continued growth of the Akademiya dependent on the education of future scholars?
Darya: If we wait until there are no successors left, it will be too late already. We can't actually bring in researchers from the Nagarjunites, right?
 You mean...
Darya: The Akademiya recently cut back on the budget for education, and that rubbed me the wrong way.
Darya: To better advance research and development, the Akademiya would recruit talented children at an early age.
Darya: I'm the teacher for those children. Seeing them mature into accomplished researchers gives me immense pride.
Darya: But if the Akademiya keeps shaving the budget, it will impact their education.
Darya: Even from the point of maintaining our prestige, I still don't think it's right.
 Did you come up with any solution?
Darya: I will have to speak out if the Akademiya continues to cut funding.
Darya: I've talked to Vikram. He also believes it's what has to be done to ensure the learning conditions for the children.
(Obtain  Guide to Admonition)
 The Nagarjunites?
Darya: The Nagarjunites were a branch of the Akademiya from long ago.
Darya: They were said to advocate strange ideals like "the transmission of knowledge at all costs" and "conflict is the natural order of Teyvat."
Darya: In short, this school of thought has long broken away from the rest of the Akademiya. They're no longer on the same branch.
Darya: Although they still seem to exist deep in the desert, most people have either never heard of them, or have, but consider them a myth.
Darya: I'm just being angry, so don't take it too seriously. I believe that sooner or later the Akademiya will take the future of our children seriously...
 See you.
Darya: Farewell. Someone has to speak out about this.
