Trivia[]
In some localizations other than English, this NPC's name includes the number thirty-three. This is explained within her dialogue after the player wins against her once. She supplies bonsai and rock gardens for sale at Tsukumomono Groceries (Japanese: 九十九物 Tsukumo-butsu, lit. "Ninety-Nine Things"), and Aoi has said that her goods could be "worth a third of many precious treasures." Thirty-three is equal to a third of ninety-nine, creating a play on words based on the store's name.
