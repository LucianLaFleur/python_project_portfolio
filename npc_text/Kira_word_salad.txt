Dialogue[]

Kira: According to instructions from the Akademiya, the latest marine conditions...
 And you are...
Kira: I'm a local fisherman. Other than fishing, I'm also a contact for the researchers sent by the Akedemiya.
Kira: The Akedemiya would take a portion of our catch in exchange for helping us fishermen to determine the distribution pattern of marine life and plan fishing seasons and moratoriums.
Kira: It's a good deal for us to exchange some fish for the assurance of bountiful hauls and safe voyage.
Kira: I remember it was calm one day, but a Scribe passing through pointed at how odd that sort of tranquility was and saved us from a stormy sail.
Kira: That only convinced us to follow the Akademiya even more, and we hope the relationship will continue.
 See you.
Kira: Goodbye. Only by understanding the sea will you get to enjoy its treasure.
