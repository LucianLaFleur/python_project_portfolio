Dialogue[]

Arayesh: Do you need an in-room haircut service?
 And you are...
Arayesh: I'm a hair stylist, at your service!
Arayesh: Leave your hair to me. I will create the most fashionable and suitable hairstyle for you.
Arayesh: Between cutting, perming, and coloring, I'm the best at coloring, especially color mixes.
Arayesh: If I were to design a style for you, for example... A little longer here, and a little shorter in the back. That'd frame your face better.
Arayesh: Then a gradient color... It would be wonderful!
 Maybe next time.
Arayesh: A change in hairstyle is a change in mood. Come to me if you need a change!
