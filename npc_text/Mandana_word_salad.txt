Mandana: Following the instructions in the manual really did make the flowers bloom really well.
 The manual?
Mandana: Yes, it's a nursing manual on ornamental plants the Lord gave me. I heard it was personally revised by a Forest Watcher.
Mandana: Following the instructions in the manual guarantees that beautiful flowers bloom all year round here.
 Lovely.
Mandana: Thanks, I'll take it as a compliment on the good job I did for the garden.
Mandana: Cutting a fresh flower with its leaves on, put it into a vase with water, and you'll make a very nice interior decoration.
Mandana: These are for you. Beautiful flowers will bring you good luck.
(Obtain  Sumeru Rose ×4)
 See you.
