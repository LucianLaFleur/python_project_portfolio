Profile[]
Roald is a famous adventurer who travels around Teyvat. At some point prior to the Traveler's arrival, he had just finished up exploring Liyue and made his way to Inazuma. However, he severely underestimated the severity of the situation at the time and was forced to rely on Sumida and Kama to get across Inazuma as he lacked the permits. Roald eventually became aware of the Traveler's reputation during his travels.
Roald would eventually be commissioned by Sumida to obtain a Maushiro and met Ruu on Tsurumi Island. However, he did not know the true extent of the situation of the island and when he returned to bring the Maushiro back, it had disappeared. After meeting the Traveler, he returned to Tsurumi Island and asked the Traveler to bring him some Fluorescent Fungus and take photos of murals on the island. After returning with them, Roald thanked them and departed from the island, only to unknowingly drop his most recent diary in the process.

Story[]
Before traveling to Liyue, Roald apparently explored Dragonspine. However, its inhospitable climate eventually got the better of him, causing him to flee to Sal Terrae.[1]
After leaving Dragonspine, he traveled to Sal Terrae, Qingce Village, Mt. Aocang, Luhua Pool, Yaoguang Shoal, Guyun Stone Forest, and Qingyun Peak, in that order. He also visited Qingxu Pool, but it is not clear when he arrived there relative to his arrival at his other destinations.
Roald traveled to Inazuma while the Sakoku Decree was in effect, but underestimated the severity of the situation before he arrived. He planned to leave Ritou after hearing that the The Crux was stopping by briefly.[2]
He was then approached by Sumida and commissioned to go to Tsurumi Island to gather reference material and look for a Maushiro, despite the fact that he doesn't have a permit to travel around Inazuma. Like many others commissioned before him, he comes back convinced he had the Maushiro and forgetting most of his travels on Tsurumi Island. He is then called back by Sumida together with the Bantan Sango Detective Agency and meets the Traveler for the first time.[3]

Trivia[]
Roald is likely named after Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen, who famously became the first to reach the South Pole, in addition to navigating the Northwest Passage.
