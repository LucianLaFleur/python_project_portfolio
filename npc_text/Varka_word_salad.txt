Profile
Based on other people's remarks about him, Varka is one of the strongest people in Mondstadt. Tartaglia calls him the "titan of the Knights of Favonius" and hopes to one day face him in combat, Barbara says that there's nothing to worry about as long as he is leading the expedition and Eula suspects that he had been intentionally holding back during a sparring session.
At some point before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt, Varka brought Rosaria to Mondstadt so she could redeem herself, although he did not appear to have expected her to do so in her own way. He also accepted Eula into the Knights of Favonius and met Razor in the forests of Wolvendom. Varka appeared to know Razor's parents, and he kept a box in storage that held some of his parents' mementos.
At some time after departing from Mondstadt, Varka learned of the Fatui plots in Mondstadt and deemed them outrageous. Prior to Weinlesefest, Varka sent Mika back to Mondstadt to inform Jean and the others who were in Mondstadt of the expedition force's status. In the letter, he explained how they meet Il Capitano and that the Harbinger had been sent to Natlan. Making use of the paper he had left, he also left a note for Lisa, having deemed it time for Razor to learn about his human parents.[5]

Appearance
Little is known about Varka's appearance, but Razor's character stories and voice-overs suggest he is extremely tall.

I hope they are okay. Oh, what am I worried about? The Grand Master is none other than the Knight of Boreas, of course they will be fine! Still, I will be sure to pray for their safe return.BennettAbout Varka Media:VO_Bennett About Varka.ogg Media:VO ZH_Bennett About Varka.ogg Media:VO JA_Bennett About Varka.ogg Media:VO KO_Bennett About Varka.ogg He's my role model! Talk about team leaders — he's the Grand Master! Leads the whole darn Knights of Favonius! How incredible do you have to be to do that!? Recently, though, I've been thinking that having a smaller Adventure Team isn't such a bad thing after all. I mean, if things got too busy in the team, I'd have no time to look after all my dads in the guild, would I? Yeah... Yeah, things are fine the way they are.DilucAbout Varka Media:VO_Diluc About Varka.ogg Media:VO ZH_Diluc About Varka.ogg Media:VO JA_Diluc About Varka.ogg Media:VO KO_Diluc About Varka.ogg Grand Master Varka...

He doesn't like to beat around the bush and has no care for rumors or trivial matters. A good guy, I guess. I sparred with him once, which ended in a tie, but his relaxed expression and leisurely attitude clearly indicated that he had been holding back the whole time... Such indignity!

The Grand Master is clearly making sure nobody neglects their training... Hmm? Mika's unaware of his own improvement? It must be one of his blind spots... or perhaps he's just being humble. Either way, things like this don't escape me.

From my own perspective, I feel very honored to work with someone like him.More About Jean: IV Media:VO_Jean More About Jean - 04.ogg Media:VO ZH_Jean More About Jean - 04.ogg Media:VO JA_Jean More About Jean - 04.ogg Media:VO KO_Jean More About Jean - 04.ogg When I'm wholeheartedly devoted to my work, all of my troubles and and even my sense of time seem to just slip away.

He taught me to think on my feet and avoid engaging enemies at close combat to make up for my small stature and relative lack of stamina. Following his advice, I learned how to fight with a polearm and crossbow, and I must say, this fighting style is far more suitable to me.About Varka: The Captain Media:VO_Mika About Varka - The Captain.ogg Media:VO ZH_Mika About Varka - The Captain.ogg Media:VO JA_Mika About Varka - The Captain.ogg Media:VO KO_Mika About Varka - The Captain.ogg The Grand Master said that I need to set higher goals for myself, and strive to achieve them. I've always had that kind of attitude, but it wasn't until I was on the expedition that I realized how serious things can become... One day, I met the Fatui Harbinger known as The Captain. I can't even begin to imagine how I can deal with an opponent like him. I just... Such powerful people are really on a level of their own, I'm not even remotely close...About Klee Media:VO_Mika About Klee.ogg Media:VO ZH_Mika About Klee.ogg Media:VO JA_Mika About Klee.ogg Media:VO KO_Mika About Klee.ogg Oh? Klee? She's super cheerful, and I've heard that... she's as strong as the Grand Master himself. She's invited me to go on adventures with her before, and we always had a great time together! Although she would experiment with dangerous weapons from time to time, which means I've had to revise my maps on several occasions... But I still feel it's worth it!More About Mika: IV Media:VO_Mika More About Mika - 04.ogg Media:VO ZH_Mika More About Mika - 04.ogg Media:VO JA_Mika More About Mika - 04.ogg Media:VO KO_Mika More About Mika - 04.ogg It seems like... after I assisted the Grand Master and Captain Eula a few times with their errands, some members of our group have begun to see me as their official messenger. If I ever misspoke, it would cause trouble for our leaders, and the blame would be all mine. So, whenever I am around others I'm unfamiliar with, I often try to only comment on things I'm absolutely confident in, which makes everyone think I'm timid. But would you say this whole situation is just a sort of misunderstanding?Favorite Food Media:VO_Mika Favorite Food.ogg Media:VO ZH_Mika Favorite Food.ogg Media:VO JA_Mika Favorite Food.ogg Media:VO KO_Mika Favorite Food.ogg The Grand Master said that a youngster like me needs to eat more meat, which will build more strength and physical stamina. Even though there's little chance I'll ever get really buff. I do like eating meat dishes. The others in the Reconnaissance Company seem to share this taste as well.NoelleAbout Varka Media:VO_Noelle About Varka.ogg Media:VO ZH_Noelle About Varka.ogg Media:VO JA_Noelle About Varka.ogg Media:VO KO_Noelle About Varka.ogg At first I wanted to join his expedition party and do my part as a maid. But the Grand Master said no — it would give him more peace of mind if I stayed behind to take care of things in Mondstadt. It made me so happy to hear how much he values me! ...Okay, so apparently he said the same thing to a lot of people. But that doesn't change the fact he prizes me too!RazorAbout Varka: Stranger Media:VO_Razor About Varka - Stranger.ogg Media:VO ZH_Razor About Varka - Stranger.ogg Media:VO JA_Razor About Varka - Stranger.ogg Media:VO KO_Razor About Varka - Stranger.ogg Varka?

Trivia
Varka gave Razor his name and taught him how to fight with claymores, suggesting he uses them himself.[6]
Varka wrote A Letter With Rough Handwriting in All's Well That Ends Well during the event Hidden Strife. Diluc's reply is found as the Letter Addressed to Grand Master Varka in Jean's office during the event.
Varka is mentioned in the description of the following Furnishing: Rally Banner
Etymology
Varka's name is likely based on the Old Persian 𐎺𐎼𐎣 varka, meaning "wolf."
Notes

↑ As there are no requirements besides Friendship Level to unlock the story, it is assumed that it is "narrated" at the start of the Traveler's journey with Paimon. This is in contrast to certain character stories that require quest completion and are thus "narrated" no earlier than certain key points in the Traveler's journey.
