Media:VO Zayah All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Zayah: (Maybe I'll be able to find a new business opportunity in Liyue...)

Dialogue[]

 And you are...?
Zayah: Hmm? I'm Zayah. A proud member of the Sangemah Bay business empire.
Zayah: I'm here on the orders of our leader, Lord Sangemah Bay, to explore new business opportunities.
Zayah: And for Mora, even becoming an unscrupulous merchant is not too great a sacrifice...
Zayah: Well, uh... But of course, I shan't be breaking any of Bayda Harbor's rules! These Navbed are pretty strict on smuggling, after all...
Zayah: Surely a little business involving good Liyue food remains onboard, yes?
 What business opportunity?
Zayah: Bayda Harbor is too close to Fontaine, so Fontainian goods aren't quite in vogue anymore.
Zayah: But Liyue? Now that's a different story.
Zayah: My mercantile nose is never wrong, I tell you! We just need to ship in some fine Liyue cuisine, such as...
 Tea leaves?
Zayah: How did you know? A Liyue merchant named Boyan told me that Chenyu Vale's tea leaves are the most renowned in the land.
Zayah: I imagine that if we promoted Chenyu Adeptea to that big client of ours, he'd love it for sure. Bet he'd order at least 10 boxes...
 Such as...
Zayah: Tiger Fish, Bamboo Shoot Soup, Crab Roe Tofu... You don't see these things in Sumeru very much, if at all.
 Have you tried all these before?
Zayah: Oh, they're on my To-Eat list, that's for sure.
Zayah: That Boyan told me that Chenyu Adeptea was the best... and then he hoodwinked me into buying a large batch of goods that turned out to be absolute junk!
Zayah: Then he turned around and said that it was just that batch of tea that was faulty, and now that the water and soil in Chenyu Vale are back to normal, so too are the tea leaves.
Zayah: I don't trust it. Fool me once, shame on you — fool me twice, shame on me...
Zayah: I'm going to Liyue personally, and I'll taste it for myself.
 Goodbye.
Zayah: Ah! Uninterested in business opportunities? A shame, a shame...
