Dialogue[]

Oguz: Hello, what can I help you with?
 And you are...
Oguz: I'm with the Eremites, hired by the Akademiya to be a guard here.
Oguz: What's important is the duty of the Eremites, not who I am. We are the only authorized mercenary organization in the entire Sumeru.
Oguz: Remember that so you won't get cheated by scammers.
Oguz: If you need a competent, reliable bodyguard or watchman in Port Ormos, see our Captain Feroz.
Oguz: He's rather blunt, but will give you good people.
 See you.
Oguz: See you.
