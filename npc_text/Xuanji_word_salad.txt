 Hey, you two...
Media:VO Xuanji 01.ogg "Hey, you two! Why don't you take a break and have a cup of tea?"

Dialogue[]

Xuanji: You've already tasted our specialty tea. The wilds can be dangerous, so if there's nothing else, do return home soon.
 Do you have any more new teas?
Xuanji: Haha, do not worry, I'm working on it as we speak.
 What do you do here exactly?
Xuanji: Hmm? That is a strange question. This here is my tea store, and what would one do with such a place, if not sell tea?
 Goodbye.
Xuanji: Stay safe!
