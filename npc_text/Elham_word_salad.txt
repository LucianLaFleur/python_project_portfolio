Dialogue[]

Elham: If only cutting fabric were as easy as stabbing sea beasts with scissors...
 Adventure Challenge
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Elham: I won. It's nice to play Genius Invokation TCG once in a while...
(If the player wins the match)

Elham: Eh, it's very difficult to play cards...
 Cutting fabric?
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Elham: Yeah, I have a tailor shop that's well-liked by the locals.
Elham: Business has been good, but... I'm not satisfied with my tailoring skills.
Elham: My regular customers just praise the clothes I make all the time, and when I ask them if they have any suggestions, they all say they don't have any.
Elham: The dressmaking skills I can learn from the Akasha are limited, and I can't get any constructive customer critiques. If things keep going this way, I'll never be able to improve my design skills!
Elham: I've recently been considering going to Fontaine for further training. I heard that there are some very good couture stores.
Elham: ...But I also heard that Fontaine produces mostly machine-made clothing and they hardly need craftsmen. What should I do...?
 Cutting fabric?
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Elham: Yeah, I run a tailor shop that's well-liked by the locals.
Elham: Business has been good, but... I'm not satisfied with my tailoring skills.
Elham: My regular customers just praise the clothes I make all the time, and when I ask them if they have any suggestions for me, they all say that they don't have any.
Elham: The number of dressmaking techniques that could be learned from the Akasha were very limited, and customer suggestions are nowhere to be sought...
Elham: The way things are going, I'll never improve my fashion design skills!
Elham: That's why I've recently been considering going to Fontaine for further training. I've heard that there are some very good couture stores.
Elham: ...On the other hand, I've also heard that Fontaine produces mostly machine-made clothing, which means that they hardly need craftsmen. What should I do...?
 Use scissors to... stab sea beasts?
Elham: Ahaha, that's... purely by accident.
Elham: One time, when I was a child, I was playing on the beach, when a sea beast attacked me.
Elham: I was playing house and making clothes with small scissors, and all of a sudden a huge sea beast charged at me.
Elham: I didn't think twice and stuck my scissors into its eyes...
Elham: The sea beast ran away immediately after getting hurt. I didn't know what was going on, but the people on the beach held me up and gave me the title of Sea Beast Killer...
Elham: To this day, people still thank me for what I did back then. Perhaps that's why they visit my tailor shop so often.
 See you.
Elham: See you.
