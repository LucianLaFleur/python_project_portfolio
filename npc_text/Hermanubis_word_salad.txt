Little concrete information is known about Hermanubis beyond his status as a renowned priest and sage.[1][2] King Deshret picked Hermanubis "from among the Tighnarians" as one of his sages.[3] After the fall of King Deshret's civilization, Hermanubis took his followers to the city of Tulaytullah, where they founded the Temple of Silence. There, they became stewards of knowledge regarding King Deshret's civilization until infighting among the Eremites led the king of Gurabad to besiege the city, demanding the Temple of Silence as proof of his victory. The ruling elite of Tulaytullah betrayed the Temple. In order to protect his followers, Hermanubis shattered himself into many pieces, imbuing his followers with his power and repelling the invaders. However, they were subsequently ostracized and constantly moved for their own protection, eventually constructing a large temple near Thamud Oasis.
Hermanubis' power would seemingly falter in the years to come, though fragments of his power — known as Ba Fragments, still existed. Prior to the Traveler's arrival, two of these fragments were in custody of the Temple of Silence, and its leader, Bamoun, had them implanted into Cyno and his adoptive grandson Sethos. Cyrus would later take Cyno with him to the Akademiya.
Some people from Sumeru Akademiya believe that Cyno is King Deshret's descendant, raised in a temple by an Hermanubis priest who gave him his Vision when the time was right; however, that story is false, as Cyno was raised in the Akademiya since childhood[1] and obtained his Vision the day before he became General Mahamatra.[4].
Bamoun and Sethos would later devise a plan to bring Cyrus to them while also attempting to mend relationships with the Akademiya; regardless of the outcome, the Temple of Silence would benefit from the result. In order to protect Cyrus, Cyno offers to duel Sethos in a Rite of Duels to see who would claim the other half of Hermanubis' power. Cyno successfully defeats Sethos in the duel, and he absorbs his fragment without issue.
