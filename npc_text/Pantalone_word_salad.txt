Profile[]
Pantalone was born into poverty and was never able to receive a Vision, leading him to question why gods held control over so many aspects of life, including things they ostensibly did not need, such as Mora. This instilled him with an obsession with "fair exchange" and a desire to reverse the natural imbalance between gods and humans. Perhaps for this reason, he works closely with The Doctor,[6] who aims to create an artificial god and nearly succeeded during Chapter III.[7]
Pantalone is currently in charge of Snezhnaya's economic policies[8] and is the wealthiest of all the Harbingers.[9] His immense wealth is such that he paid for the Fatui's exclusive, indefinite use of the Goth Grand Hotel in Mondstadt upfront.[10] When Bao'er saw the kinds of business transactions Landa was handling on Pantalone's behalf, she warns the Traveler against trying to find out more about it.[11]
Uncle Tian believes Pantalone's plan — to make Snezhnaya the "heart that pumps money around the world"[12] and perhaps entirely replace Mora as a currency[13] — has the potential to "shake the world to its core,"[9] and fellow Harbingers Tartaglia and Wanderer both characterize him by his ambition.[6][14]

Story[]
Little is known about Pantalone's background beyond being born into poverty and never being deemed worthy of a Vision, which fueled his resentment against the gods. Rex Lapis in particular appears to be the greatest target of Pantalone's ire,[12][13] as he is the sole source of Mora and as a result, Teyvat's economy is effectively under his control.[15]
At some point, Pantalone secretly began an experiment to test the feasibility of a new, alternate currency to Mora. He picked the secluded Fortress of Meropide as the testing ground for his experiment and had his agents introduce Credit Coupons, which soon became the Fortress' exclusive currency.[13][Note 1] It is unclear how long Credit Coupons have been around, but they have been in use for a "very long time" and were used by the administrator before Wriothesley.[16]
One of Yelan's past operations involved Pantalone as her opponent and resulted in the loss of a Fascinating Bracelet, an heirloom pair of magical communication devices, rendering the surviving bracelet useless. To make up for her loss, she infiltrated Pantalone's secret trade route and got ahold of a highly valuable robe made with a powerful beast's fur, which he had intended as a gift to the Tsaritsa. She has since taken the beast's fur to create the white mantle she currently wears.[5]

Present Day[]
While Pantalone has yet to directly influence the story, his influence can be felt in various parts of the seven nations. Sometime before the Traveler arrived in Mondstadt, Pantalone booked the entire Goth Grand Hotel for the Fatui's exclusive use; while Goth was opposed to it due to the Goth family's motto of serving the people of Mondstadt, Pantalone paid for the entire intended duration upfront with an "unbelievably generous" offer.[10]
His agent Landa can be found at Wangshu Inn,[17] who is also implied to be the Snezhnayan agent who abandoned his mission to infiltrate Mondstadt's wine industry after getting spooked by Noelle's behavior.[18] Landa loses the invoices for a major, top-secret transaction at the start of the World Quest Big Business, causing him to enlist the Traveler's help. Bao'er, who chanced upon one of the invoice boxes and took a peek inside, advises the Traveler not to ask too many questions about "transactions of this scale," and Landa panics at the realization that an outsider knows the details of the transaction.[11]
At "The Rusty Rudder" in Fontaine, the contents of the Discarded Bill in front of "Tilla" likely relates to Landa; it mentions three heavy shipments from Liyue, and states that "our friends in Liyue" are in trouble. Brek, who is mentioned in the Bill, reveals that he has made a deal with a "prominent merchant from Snezhnaya."[19]
While not directly involved in the events of Yelan's Story Quest Umbrabilis Orchis Chapter: Act I - Calculated Gambit, Pantalone intervenes after Yusupov's plan to assassinate Uncle Tian and establish Zhiyi as the new Tianshu fails. Having kept an eye on the proceedings, Pantalone extracted Theofan, Yusupov's subordinate and Zhiyi's co-conspirator, from Liyue off-screen before Yelan could make him her pawn. Given that Pantalone still has his eyes on Liyue, Yelan plans on using this as the basis for her next mission.[9]
Pantalone is collaborating with Pulcinella on something known as "Project Stuzha," which is supposedly setting the Fatui's future direction. Leading up to the project, they gave the House of the Hearth a great deal of funding and have since made the Hearth "key members" of Project Stuzha. Given this means they will likely face the largest casualties, Arlecchino and the other members of the Hearth suspect this ploy is meant to weaken and obtain more control over them.[20] Tartaglia was also recalled to Snezhnaya to participate in the project.

He can formulate grand plans and manipulate the economy with ease, yet at the same time, he allows his actions to be governed by the vengeance and hatred locked in the depths of his heart.

He's obsessed with the idea of "fair exchange," to the point of wanting to overthrow the natural imbalance between gods and humans. But, I guess it's just how ordinary mortals are like — it's easy for them to come up with pointless delusions. Honestly, it's nothing worth writing home about, just like how there's also nothing impressive about his abilities or choice of partner. Hmph. Anyone who chooses to work closely with The Doctor is sure to meet a nasty end.
Trivia[]
It is unclear whether Pantalone had a direct link to the former Fontainian criminal organization Club di Pantaloni Novita.[Note 2] Regardless, the newspaper clipping about its dismantlement at the Spina di Rosula's hands is found at "The Rusty Rudder," adding to the list of implications that several of the NPCs found there are Pantalone's associates.
Both the Damaged News Clip at "The Rusty Rudder" and an exchange on the Lumidouce Harbor Noticeboard suggest that someone is artificially inflating the price of Chenyu Vale's tea; whether this is another one of Pantalone's schemes has yet to be confirmed.
Etymology[]
Like the other Harbingers, Pantalone's alias is derived from a stock character in commedia dell'arte, a type of Italian theater which uses masks to designate their character's role in the story.
"Pantalone" is greedy and uses his high social standing to push others around and interfere with their business. Oftentimes, he is the father of one of the Innamorati and tries to keep the two lovers apart.
The literal meaning of "Pantalone" in Italian is "Pants."
A regrator (or regrater) is a person who purchases goods from a market, then resells that item in the same (or nearby) market at an inflated price.

Notes[]

↑ Pantalone is assumed to be the mastermind behind Credit Coupons based on the narrative similarities between Moment of Cessation and Cashflow Supervision's descriptions.

↑ The organization's name is not translated identically across localizations, making it unclear whether the similarities between Pantalone and "Pantaloni" were intended by the original Chinese text, which simply called the organization 新奇裤俱乐部 lit. "New Pants Club."
