 Make preparations...

Media:VO Ma'asudi All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Ma'asudi: (They all say Kshahrewar gets the smallest budget, but I don't think Spantamad is treated any better.)

Dialogue[]

Ma'asudi: It's time to hire new mercenaries for the next study... Another bill to pay.
 Is there anything of note nearby?
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Ma'asudi knows)

Ma'asudi: Hearing that I'm making models, a kindhearted local told me there's a place nearby where I can find Crystal Ores. They also said there are some blue ores that look special.
Ma'asudi: Unfortunately, despite that the ores there are of good quality, they are not suitable for my current research.
Ma'asudi: You need ores? Head in this direction and you'll find them.
(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Ma'asudi knows)

Ma'asudi: Sorry, I've been busy recently, worrying all day about the funding for my research. I haven't been paying much attention to what's happening around me...
 Are you caught short financially?
Ma'asudi: Sort of. Instead of saying I don't have enough money, it's more accurate to say that the allocated funds are always delayed.
Ma'asudi: Because I travel to the desert frequently to investigate the ruins mechanisms, I've already taken up residence in Caravan Ribat just to save on the travel costs.
Ma'asudi: Even so, I still have to pay out of pocket.
Ma'asudi: ...Is the Akademiya doing this to warn us against going deep into the desert?
Ma'asudi: *sigh* Maybe I'm just overthinking and the Akademiya is just too poor. If I'd known this would happen, I would have taken a job for the fortifications instead.
 See you.
Ma'asudi: See you. I hope the funds will be delivered without a hitch.
