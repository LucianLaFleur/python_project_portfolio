Onitaka is a leader of a pirate group that was active on Yashiori Island after the war between the Shogun's Army and the Watatsumi Army erupted. He was paid by Yasumoto to bring Chouji's Mother to Sumeru, where Yasumoto hopes the Sumeru Akademiya can find a cure for her condition.[1] Before leaving, Onitaka tasked his men with taking care of Chouji, who was left alone in Higi Village following his father's disappearance and his mother's departure.[2]
