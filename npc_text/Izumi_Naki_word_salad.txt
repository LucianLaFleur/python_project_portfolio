Dialogue[]

Izumi Naki: May it go well with Watatsumi Island this year also...
 You are...
Izumi Naki: I am a shrine maiden here at the Sangonomiya Shrine, and the Divine Priestess' wishes are my command.
 Could you tell me more about the Divine Priestess?
Izumi Naki: Her Excellency, Sangonomiya Kokomi, is our Divine Priestess — and our supreme leader.
Izumi Naki: Her bloodline is very special indeed, and she is the sole heir of Watatsumi Island. Naturally, the people of Sangonomiya Shrine obey her orders.
Izumi Naki: Her Excellency has both ability and political integrity, and is skilled in many different fields. She is the undisputed leader of Watatsumi Island.
Izumi Naki: ...Her duties and cares are many, however, and even she must need some space to herself to think quietly.
Izumi Naki: As such, I would advise that you not disturb her, unless it's something important.
 See you.
Izumi Naki: See you. May Watatsumi Omikami watch over you.
