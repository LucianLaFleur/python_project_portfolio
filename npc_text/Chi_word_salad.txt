Chi (Chinese: 螭 Chī), also known as Qingce (Chinese: 轻策 Qīngcè) in the ancient language,[1] was a serpent[2] God who dwelt in what is now Qingce Village before being defeated and sealed away by Morax.[3] There still remains many legends surrounding its banishment, which are detailed in the World Quest The Chi of Yore.
The term "Chi" may also refer to a type of dragon-like sea monster that lived around the Liyue region and the oceans beyond it.[4]

The Chi of Mt. Qingce[]
Thousands of years ago, Chi made its nest in the area now known as Mt. Qingce and took control of the region. For this, Morax fought it at a "great height" and succeeded in slaying the beast. However, even after its death, the Chi's power continued to seep into the land. To suppress its power, Morax defeated each aspect of the Chi:

...Rex Lapis overcame the Chi, but the Chi could not perish in its entirety. Thus did Rex Lapis conquer each of its facets in turn: its spirit was bound in the north, its bones were pinned in the south-east, its flesh was incarcerated in the north-west, its soul was fettered in the north-east, and its form was crushed in the south-west...—Incomplete Writing at Qingce Village
Additionally, Morax taught the people of Qingce Village to make Geo Statues to crush the Chi's remaining power. Many of these statues can be found scattered across the area around Qingce Village, some of which have glowing features for unknown reasons. According to Xiao, these statues are of Morax's likeness.[2] Additionally, crystalline orange adeptus amber can also be found around Qingce, which also helps suppress and crush the Chi's power.[5]
Over time, a legend formed that the Chi's body turned into Mt. Qingce after it died, with its scales forming the terraced fields. People in Liyue believe that the Blood-Fed Trees in Bishui Plain grew by absorbing the Chi's blood, and that the area where they grew are the Chi's eyes. However, Zhongli reveals that Mt. Qingce stood long before Chi ravaged the area.[6]
During The Chi of Yore, the Traveler enters the vault in northwestern Qingce. Within it is a giant glowing orb suspended in midair, underneath which is the Qingce Cache mechanism. Upon activating the mechanism, the Traveler has to defend the mechanism from various Ruin Machines while rocks crash down from the ceiling. After completing the challenge, the treasure room is opened, but the Traveler and Paimon report to Granny Ruoxin that no traces of Chi were found, leaving the glowing orb within the vault a mystery.
During Baizhu's Story Quest Lagenaria Chapter: Act I - The Heart of Healing, the ethereal remains of Chi lingered in a cave, and was collected and converted into medicine by Jiangli, an old acquaintance of Baizhu who apprenticed under the same master, so as to treat her husband Jialiang's heart disease. However, Chi's remains were too potent for mortals to tolerate, and so both eventually succumbed to great illness. At the end of the quest, Baizhu destroyed the remains of Chi inside the cave, which cleansed the poison within Jiangli and restored her to good health. 

Other Chi[]
The Skipper, who lived around a thousand years ago, defeated at least one Chi and turned its spine into his greatsword, known as Serpent Spine (Chinese: 螭骨剑 "Chi Spine Sword").[4]

Etymology[]
In Chinese mythology, 螭 chi is a type of hornless dragon-like creature. It can alternatively mean "mountain demon."
It is contrasted with 虬 qiú, a type of horned dragon (though some classical texts call it a hornless dragon as well). Another sea monster named Baqiu (Chinese: 八虬 Bāqiú) is mentioned in the description of Primordial Jade Winged-Spear.
