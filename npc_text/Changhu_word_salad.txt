Dialogue[]

Gentry Maocai: You can see why that Dr. Liu has made a name for himself as one of Liyue's top orators. That part about the Guhua Clan plaque getting smashed... Hahaha, killed me!
Changhu: Ahaha, you can say that again... Although with the likes of you in the audience, sir, I'm hardly surprised that he was giving it all he had!
Gentry Maocai: My last attendant, the guy before you, saw a Guhua guy. Couldn't use a blade or bow to save himself. Learned some kinda leg-based kung fu.
Gentry Maocai: From day one, he was always boasting to me how his "legs of steel," as he called them, could carry him a thousand miles.
Changhu: Ha! I mean, who'd be able to keep up with you, sir, if they didn't have a little endurance?
Gentry Maocai: Anyway... so that kid o' mine had just reached that age where they run around the house, screaming their heads off... y'know, driving everyone crazy. So I go to this Guhua lad and I say, oi! Legs of steel! Take this kid out for a ride in the sedan chair, and don't come back till he says he's had enough!
Changhu: Your young one is certainly gifted with boundless energy, sir! Destined to follow in your footsteps, that's for sure!
Gentry Maocai: You can probably guess what happened next... My kid makes it the longest sedan chair ride of his life, keeps the Guhua lad running for three days and three nights straight — no food, no water, no sleep...
Gentry Maocai: When he finally gets back to the house, he slumps down on the floor and you can just tell... Those legs of steel are not going anywhere for me ever again! He just sits there, motionless, with this stony expression on his face like he's impersonating a statue of Guhua's founder or something. Guys like that, honestly... Good thing I got you in to replace him.
Changhu: Hahaha... Oh sir, you do tell the funniest anecdotes. I can just imagine him sat there in the lotus position like some kung fu master statue... Probably the closest he ever got to enlightenment!
Gentry Maocai: Yeah... Tell you what though, I do miss having him around sometimes. Those three days were the most peaceful I've had in a long time. Hey, come to think of it, don't you have a sedan chair carrier's license too?
Changhu: Ahahahaha, hahaha... haha... ha. Ah...
Changhu: What, er... What are you suggesting, sir?
