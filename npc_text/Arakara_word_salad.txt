Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

Arakara: Little Nara in Vimara Village don't know how to farm... but other Nara cannot see Aranara...
 Is something worrying you?
Arakara: Ah, it's Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Hello.
Arakara: I am curious, about Nara's way of farming. They don't praise flowers, or sing to fruit trees.
Arakara: But their way makes trees happy, too.
Arakara: Do you know how they do that, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 Fertilizing and watering?
Arakara: Watering, that I understand. Plants like water, like how I love farming.
Arakara: "Fea-ther-lizing"... What is that?
Arakara: Giving feathers to fruit trees to make them fly...?
 About Viparyas...
Arakara: Viparyas are very happy. Happier than hearing any song by Arakara and Aranakula.
Arakara: Is it because of meeting the Golden Nara?
 Goodbye.
Arakara: Thank you for helping Arakara, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).

Dialogue Set #2[]

Arakara: Marana has been defeated, so Vana has more lands for farming now. But Valuka is still no good...
 About Marana...
Arakara: Thanks to Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), there are no more traces of Marana in Vana.
Arakara: The land that was once polluted by Marana can now hear the laughter of Viparyas.
Arakara: When Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) comes to Vana next time, you will definitely see greener green than now.
 About Valuka...
Arakara: Valuka is different from Vana. All the earth has turned into golden remains.
Arakara: No Aranara have been there, not even Aradasha.
Arakara: But I heard there are Nara farming in Valuka. I wonder how do the Nara there make the flowers happy.
Arakara: If Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) goes to Valuka someday, can you ask the Nara there about this for me?
 Okay.
Arakara: Thank you, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). I hope that one day, Viparyas flowers can also bloom on Valuka land.
