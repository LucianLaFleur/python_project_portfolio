Dialogue[]

Makhfi: The life of a researcher is more than just researching topics.
 What happened?
Makhfi: Sorry you had to hear me complain.
Makhfi: I was just lamenting that researchers have to deal with so many things on top of their own research.
Makhfi: Such as official Akademiya assignments, delegated tasks from mentors, getting along with peers, and sometimes, even inquiry from the matra.
Makhfi: *sigh* If only these things could just resolve themselves, like a tree shedding its leaves...
Makhfi: Now I understand more or less why Tighnari left the Akademiya.
 See you.
Makhfi: The simple life is gone forever...
Event Dialogue[]
A Parade of Providence[]

Makhfi: I didn't expect Tighnari, who rarely shows himself in the city, to participate in the Interdarshan Championship.
Makhfi: I don't know much about Tighnari. He doesn't strike me as someone who is fame-hungry... Perhaps too many people were recommending him, and he didn't want to disappoint them.
Makhfi: Speaking of which, I think he's planning to hold a new lecture next month.
Makhfi: I must note down the time of his lecture before I forget... I can't miss it!

Trivia[]
Makhfi may be the unnamed researcher featured in one of the photos shown at the end of Tighnari's Story Quest Vulpes Zerda Chapter: Act I - The Unanswerable Problems, as she also mentions Tighnari in her dialogues.
