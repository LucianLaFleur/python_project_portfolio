Godwin's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Godwin is a member of the Knights of Favonius and part of the elite squadron directly under the command of the Grand Master Varka.
As he was preparing to go on Varka's expedition, he lost his keepsake from his lover Glory and fell behind while trying to find it, which led him to losing both the keepsake and the expedition. Now he only roams outside the city gates, faking being on a reconnaissance mission because he is too ashamed to return to Glory in his current state.

Appearance[]
Godwin wears one of the standard uniforms of the Knights of Favonius. The uniform consists of a black shirt and pants with white plate armor worn on top. Only the armor covering the legs and feet is black. The Knights of Favonius crest decorates the breastplate, and a sword rests on his left side.

Dialogue[]

Godwin: I'm, uh... on an exploratory reconnaissance mission.
Godwin: Do you need help with anything?
 I don't think I've seen you in the city before.
Godwin: Oh, you wouldn't have. I belong to an elite squadron of the Knights of Favonius, hand-picked by and reporting directly to Grand Master Varka himself. Our job is to be out there on the front line, defending Mondstadt.
Godwin: We are always called out on top-priority missions, so we hardly have time to hang about in the city.
Godwin: Speaking of which... Have you ever met a girl called Glory?
 Who is Varka?
Godwin: He is the current Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius. Of all the people in Mondstadt, he is the most deserving of our trust and admiration.
Godwin: And that's not an overstatement. I am sure my fellow knights share my opinion.
Godwin: For senior knights like us, there is nothing more glorious than to accompany the Grand Master himself on an expedition.
Godwin: And I get to be part of just such a glorious expedition!
 Where's the rest of the expedition party?
Godwin: That's what I wanna know, too!
Godwin: I... You see... The thing is...
Godwin: *sigh* Forget it, I'm past the point of trying to save face...
Godwin: As Grand Master Varka's expedition party was getting ready to leave Mondstadt, I—I lost a keepsake from Glory and then fell behind when they set off...
Godwin: So now, as you can see, I've lost both the keepsake and the expedition party. I can't bring myself to go crawling back to Glory like this...
Godwin: If you want to laugh at me, go ahead. A little laughter might make things more bearable.
 Who's Glory?
Godwin: Glory is the girl I love. She likes sitting on a bench, listening to the sound of the wind, and feeling the warmth of another body next to her's [sic]... That's what she said, anyway.
Godwin: If you see her around the city, please...
Godwin: Ugh, never mind, there's no need to bother you.
 Well Godwin, you are an odd fellow. Goodbye.
Godwin: ...Look after yourself, traveler.
 About your patrols...
Godwin: So far, I've taken care of quite a few hilichurls and slimes, but there's always more of them...
Godwin: They've been appearing more frequently of late. I cannot allow them to get any closer to Mondstadt. My lover Glory is...
Godwin: ...No, it's nothing. Thanks for listening to me. Stay safe on your travels. Here's some of the experience I've gained out in the wild — I hope it'll be useful to you.

Event Dialogue[]
Invitation of Windblume and Windblume's Breath[]

Godwin: *sigh* I wonder how Glory is doing...
Godwin: I wish I could return to Mondstadt to see her... But I can't. How can I let her know that her lover is a coward and a deserter?
Godwin: The best I can do now is clear out monsters and do my part to protect Mondstadt... and her.
Godwin: Laugh if you want. I'm... I'm a useless man.
