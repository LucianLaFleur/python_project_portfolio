Huang the Third's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Huang the Third can be found in the northern part of Yilong Wharf just south of the northern teleport waypoint prior to accepting the world quest A Wangshan Walk to Remember.
Huang the Third is a member of the Guhua Clan. However, as the clan has been in decline, the clan's training grounds and Wangshan Hall had been neglected. To help (barely) maintain the hall, Huang would look for people in Yilong Wharf to swindle of their Mora by giving them a tour of the grounds.
He eventually comes upon the Traveler and Paimon, convincing them to join under the guise of treasure that would be theirs. However, they soon realize the truth after a brief tour of Wangshan Hall, and Paimon gets payback on him with a burnt, overly salted steak when he requests something to eat. They then threaten to report him to the Millelith, but he begs them not to and gives them the Wangshan Hall Backup Key so they could claim the "treasure", which existed, but modern disciples could not find. He admits that they were honest compared to the others, and their willingness to humor him made him feel that the books in the hall would be better off with them before leaving.
Using the keys, the Traveler quickly discovers the true "treasure" of Wangshan Hall, having discovered a secret, hidden area that had been submerged in water.

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available after completing A Wangshan Walk to Remember.


Wen the Fourth: Sigh... To think that after a thousand years of heritage, the Guhua Clan's head doorkeeper must cheat others to survive... What shall we do, what can be done...
Huang the Third: Ugh... Alright, come on now. Am I not sparing my junior from starving to death while guarding our gates...?
Huang the Third: And don't look at me like that. You're always depressed... But you were pleased to see (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)'s performance just now, weren't you?
Wen the Fourth: That fool from before? They get to take a look around in exchange for making you a meal? And I should be pleased about that? Were I a few years younger, I would slay you in one smack...
Huang the Third: Heh! Your technique was inferior to mine just a few years ago!
Huang the Third: ...Anyway, listen... Only a few of us geezers are left. What do you plan to do after we stop testing those who may be destined to join us? Take those books with us to our graves?
Wen the Fourth: ...
Huang the Third: Hah... Just forget it. What's the point of saying such depressing things?
Huang the Third: Oh, why don't you try the food those kids made me? Hehe! I think it's better than Wanmin Restaurant's fare! Here, take a bite! Just a bite!

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Shrouded Vale, Hidden Hero.


Huang the Third: Ah, esteemed visitors, this must be a fated meeting! Are you interested in seeing a place of great significance to the Guhua... Oh my, it's you!
 How's your fated meetings been going?
Huang the Third: I've had quite a few earnest guests come with me to Wangshan Hall. No doubt due to the fortune you brought, of course...
Huang the Third: They didn't leave much Mora behind, but they certainly did contribute to Wangshan Hall's repair fund.
Huang the Third: Do drop by if the fancy strikes you, by the way!
 Still need me to make you a meal?
Huang the Third: Oh, no, no! Your sincerity was well-felt indeed!
Huang the Third: On the contrary, it should be I who should whip up a good dish for you, or perhaps treat you to a restaurant meal!
Huang the Third: Uh, hang on a moment, let me check our expenses over the last few days...
Huang the Third: *cough* Well, let's have that feast another day, shall we?
 Alright, you do you, then!
Huang the Third: You are most kind! May we meet again!
