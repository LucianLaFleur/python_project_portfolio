 I hate this place...
Media:VO Desnos 01.ogg Desnos: "When will I be able to go back?"

Dialogue[]

Desnos: When will I be able to start working at the Institute again...
 Are you still working here?
Desnos: Honorary Senior Researcher! So happy to see you! Take a seat, I'll make some coffee... Oh. I drank all the coffee. I guess I'll have to pour you some water.
Desnos: Right. As you see, I'm continuing my qualifications review work here. But... well, as before, there are still very few adventurers coming to apply for work.
 Do you even have coffee to drink here?
Desnos: Of course. This is an official Fontaine Research Institute satellite office. It has everything an office should have, in full compliance with the full standards for office supplies.
Desnos: And while my office might lack walls, it does have a ceiling. I'm doing much better than all those project teams who had their entire offices blown to smithereens.
 I'll let you get on with your work.
Desnos: You're too kind. Take care.
