Zosimos' locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Like other characters in the Mirage (besides Idyia), the blue-haired Zosimos that the Traveler meets is a Hydro Eidolon replica of a human from Teyvat that once visited Mirage and then left it.[2]
The real Zosimos works as a prop designer for stage performances, but has been dreaming of creating his own show for a long time. He has been aspiring to be a director since he was very young. Judging from his attire, it is implied that he came from Fontaine.
Zosimos is an aspiring stage director who wishes to create his own show, which is a story about a thief and a mage. After meeting the Traveler and their friends, he invites Kokomi, Klee, and Kaeya to star on his show and asks the Traveler to be the backstage crew. He also lets Klee and Kaeya keep their stage costume as a thank you for helping his show.[3]

Appearance[]
Like other characters in the Mirage, Zosimos has watery-blue hair and glowing blue eyes. He wears typical Fontaine male attire without a hat and has a moustache.

Dialogue[]

Zosimos: Oh, it's been a while, haha. How are you? Enjoying yourself here?
Zosimos: Thanks to you, the Veluriyam Mirage is back in action! The missing pieces are gradually being restored, and this place is becoming just as lively as it was before.
 About the show...
Zosimos: Oh, thanks in no small part to your efforts, I finally saw my own show! And I got a lot of useful feedback, too.
Zosimos: I'll keep working hard on my storytelling skills! I shall definitely become a true "Director."
 About the Hydro Eidolons...
Zosimos: The Hydro Eidolons, right? They can't speak, but... "We" have our ways of communicating.
Zosimos: To me, they are extremely reliable partners.
Zosimos: In fact, the outdoor stages simply can't function without them. If you have time, you should see for yourself.
Zosimos: As for the stories... Hehe, most were written by yours truly. As always, your honest feedback would be greatly appreciated.
 Pardon me, I need to leave now.
Zosimos: Haha, no problem! This is a nice place, so take your time looking around. Ah, and don't forget, you are always welcome to give me suggestions for improvements.

Trivia[]
Under the effects of Elemental Sight, Zosimos is indicated to be affected by Hydro, similarly to Idyia and the residents of Veluriyam Mirage.
