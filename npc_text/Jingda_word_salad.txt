 It's not me you're after...
Media:VO Jingda 01.ogg "I hope it's not me you're after."

Dialogue[]

Jingda: *sigh*
Jingda: Why am I so unlucky, that of all the people you could have spoken to, you chose me?
 What's wrong?
Jingda: Nothing. Life is exhausting enough by itself. Then there's talking to people, which takes brain power — and you know what's also exhausting? Using my brain.
Jingda: Ah, my existence is so tragic...
 Sorry. It's nothing.
Jingda: Oh, nothing, is it. Great...
