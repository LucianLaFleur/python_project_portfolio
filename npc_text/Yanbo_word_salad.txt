Yanbo's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Yanbo is first encountered in disguise as a Treasure Hoarder in The Chasm, alongside other Millelith members that the Traveler must defeat in order to begin his World Quest.
Yanbo reveals that he and his squad members have been sent to infiltrate the Treasure Hoarders occupying the Chasm, as well as securing the area and defending one of the Bedrock Keys in the vicinity. He claims that the Traveler has broken the law and must serve a lengthy prison sentence unless they agree to help him clear out the Treasure Hoarder camps in Lumberpick Valley.
As Yanbo is now undermanned due to the Traveler putting part of his squad out of commission, he requests them to clear out two out of the three supply camps in the area, while he and his men neutralize the third. Once that is done, the Treasure Hoarders at their main camp will be severely weakened, depending on what minor camps were defeated.
At the main camp, Yanbo and the Traveler discover that the Treasure Hoarders are under the command of Brass Bull Zhao and Chen the Flower, who are apparently setting up a deal with the Fatui. It is revealed that the Fatui are apparently buying rations and foodstuffs off the Treasure Hoarders; enraged at the interruption, Zhao sends multiple waves of her men against the Traveler.
With the Treasure Hoarders and Fatui defeated by the Traveler, Yanbo would end up foiling the agreement supplying rations down to the Fatui expedition in the mines, unknowingly dooming his former friends to starvation.

Appearance[]
Yanbo initially appears wearing Treasure Hoarder attire, before switching into Millelith clothes by the end of the quest.

Dialogue[]

Yanbo: Hello there!
 How have things been lately?
Yanbo: Alright. We got quite a bit done here. The Chasm should be much safer now.
 What did you get out of this?
Yanbo: What did we get, huh. Well, we found a lot of raw ore, food, and daily necessities, which we think were bought at low prices from Liyue Harbor.
Yanbo: We originally thought that the foodstuffs and daily necessities had to be some cover for trading other more dangerous goods, but neither investigation nor interrogation has gotten us anywhere.
Yanbo: It seems that they really were just selling foodstuffs to the Fatui, which is very strange..
 Maybe the Fatui really need food?
Yanbo: That... doesn't seem all that believable. Unless...
 Unless...?
Yanbo: Nothing, really. I don't believe that the Fatui would make such a huge fuss over foodstuffs. You've also faced them before — I'm sure you know that they aren't simple opponents to deal with. These devious fellows must have some other goal in mind.
Yanbo: Whatever the case, it seems that we have foiled their scheme. Thanks for your help. The Millelith will not forget it.
