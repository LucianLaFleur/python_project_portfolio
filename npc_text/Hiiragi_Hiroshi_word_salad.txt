Lord Hiiragi Hiroshi (Japanese: 柊弘嗣 Hiiragi Hiroshi) was a historical figure who lived around 500 years ago. He was the leader of the Hiiragi Clan and was also the Kanjou Commissioner at the time.[1][2][3] He is known for miraculously building a prosperous trade center from a deserted island, now known as Ritou, and greatly impressing the Shogun.[4]

Hiroshi desired to create a port in order to centralize foreign trade under the Inazuman government.[2] He ultimately succeeded, creating the trading hub of Ritou. To prove its benefits, he imported various foreign inventions, including a Snezhnayan blast furnace used to create the hot springs at Tenshukaku (as a gift for the Shogun) and a special Kamera which could record memories and emotions (built using a demon-exorcising mirror gifted to the Hiiragi Clan by the Kitsune Saiguu).[5]
The Kitsune Saiguu saw Hiroshi as a friend, and remembered his work to bring economic prosperity to Inazuma while reminiscing about the mortals she had come to know, during her last moments.[1]
After the cataclysm, when Iwakura Michihiro became the sword instructor for the Kujou Clan, Hiroshi trained under him, noting that he would have recruited Michihiro for the Hiiragi Clan if the Kujou had not done so first. At this time, Hiroshi was still of a young age.[3]
