Dialogue[]

Kazim: We must check on the White Lift every morning and every night.
 Is there anything of note nearby?
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Kazim knows)

Kazim: When I was preparing materials to repair the White Lift with, I did come across some sites that contain ore. I even discovered some Magical Crystal Ore there, if you'll believe it!
Kazim: We don't lack for any of that in the village at the moment, so they're yours if you want them.
(Rich Ore Reserves marked on the map)
(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Kazim knows)

Kazim: All is well... lately, anyway. The White Lift is functioning well enough, but we shouldn't get careless just the same.
 Who are you?
Kazim: I watch over the White Lift. I'm also in charge of its maintenance and repair.
Kazim: This machine is very important to the village's water supply. Before it was built, we had to get our water one bucket at a time.
Kazim: Its critical importance is precisely why I am planning to secure its future while I still can.
Kazim: Fortunately, my son Kazan, unlike many other young people, has not left the village to become a mercenary or a traveling merchant. As such, I'm planning to pass everything I know onto him.
Kazim: That way, he can take over in case I become unable to work.
 So, what's the White Lift, exactly?
Kazim: This elevator was built with the help of a Village Keeper a long time ago.
Kazim: You know of Village Keepers, yes? Those are the mad researchers exiled here by the Akademiya.
Kazim: They're a little batty most of the time, but sometimes, they'll pull themselves together and help us out.
Kazim: Anyway, back to the White Lift. The Village Keeper who helped build it is said to have been a Kshahrewar researcher. In fact, some people wanted to name the machine the Kshahrewar Lift at first.
Kazim: But I'm sure you know how things have always been a bit testy between Aaru Village and the Akademiya. I doubt that name would have gone down well with everyone.
Kazim: So in the end, we just named it after the color that represents Kshahrewar — and that's how it became known as the White Lift.
 I see.
Kazim: The longer I work at this job, the more I come to think that everything should be planned out in advance, with contingencies to match.
Kazim: I'm very grateful to the Village Keepers for their aid, but we can't always rely on them.
Kazim: Preventing problems before they can occur is the safest way to go about things.
Kazim: That applies to you, too, I believe. There are always times when we need to do some repairs outdoors, so take this — better safe than sorry.
(Obtain  Crystal Chunk ×4)
 See you around.
Kazim: Goodbye.  Always be prepared for a rainy day!
