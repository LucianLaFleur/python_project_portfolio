Dialogue[]

Dialogue Set #1[]
Available prior to completing Three Wishes‍[verification needed].

Kozue: My apologies, but Komore Teahouse does not just serve anyone. Please leave.
Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Three Wishes‍[verification needed].

Kozue: Please wait, dear customer... Ah, it's you.
Kozue: What is your business in Komore Teahouse today?
 You are still as cautious as ever.
Kozue: Komore Teahouse has the best view among all the high-end tea houses on this street. Many customers come here on its account.
Kozue: But of course, there are some guests who come here for our owner. They don't really drink tea, but they do want to see Taroumaru, which is troubling...
Kozue: They just barge in here without knowing the first thing about this place. Their bravery is indeed commendable, but I wouldn't make much of anything else about them.
Kozue: Only the guests who are approved by me may enter. As for the rest of the riffraff, I shall politely ask them to leave.
 Politely, you say.
Kozue: Yes. Do you have any doubts about that?
Kozue: As the hostess of a high-end tea house and the retainer of the Kamisato Clan, being understanding is a necessary virtue.
Kozue: Even if the guest is not an upstanding person, I will still treat them with respect... as long as they know how to be respectful in turn.
 There appears to be a odds [sic] person in the courtyard.
Kozue: Ah, as expected. You noticed as well?
Kozue: There is no need to worry. That "young and capable individual" with "friends from many lands" with "profound knowledge" and "surprisingly great taste in tea" is already under my surveillance. There will not be any problems.
 I'm here to play with Taroumaru.
Kozue: Ah... even you...
Kozue: If it were just some ordinary guest, I wouldn't have allowed it. Is Taroumaru some mongrel by the road, that they may pet him without even buying some tea first?
Kozue: Taroumaru is the owner of Komore Teahouse. Every staff member working here has signed a contract with it, and are to remain trapped here to work forever, unable to leave...
Kozue: Therefore, though I can make an exception to let you interact with Taroumaru, I recommend that you watch yourself.
Kozue: ...Eh? You are looking forward to signing a contract with Taroumaru? Well...
 See you around.
Kozue: Goodbye. I hope that you will have a safe journey.

When we first arrived at the Komore Teahouse, Paimon really thought that Taroumaru would be able to speak...(Traveler): You sound a bit disappointed.Paimon: Of course! If Taroumaru could speak, Paimon feels that he'd say something really interesting!(Traveler): For example?Paimon: Hmm... "Thoma, stop hiding around here, you're in my way! *woof*"(Traveler): Huh, that makes sense.Paimon: Or... "Kozue, you're bound to me for the rest of your life, unless our contract is terminated! *woof* *woof*"(Traveler): You didn't believe Kozue when she said she'd signed a secret contract forcing her to work part-time at the Teahouse, did you?Paimon: Oh! Paimon just thought of another one. This one's quite good—Paimon: "Just look at this visitor! Paimon, is it? Look at how cute and clever she is. Today, all her meals are on the house! *woof*"(Traveler): There's no way Taroumaru would say something like that.Paimon: Hee-hee...
