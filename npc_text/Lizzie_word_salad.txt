Appearance[]
Lizzie wears one of the standard uniforms of the Knights of Favonius. The uniform consists of a black long-sleeved shirt, tight-fitting pants under a gray skirt and then white plate armor worn on top. Unlike other Knights, she does not have her knees covered and only has greaves on her legs. The Knights of Favonius crest decorates the breastplate and a sheathed sword hangs from her belt on her right side.

Dialogue[]
Invitation of Windblume[]

Lizzie: Hey there! Having fun this Windblume Festival?
 What do you do here?
Lizzie: I'm in charge of welcoming guests, and of organizing all sorts of fun activities for everyone during the Windblume Festival.
Lizzie: A lot of the events are being held outdoors due to the large area needed, so without a guide to tell them where things are happening, lots of people are going to miss out!
Lizzie: And I, Lizzie, am glad to step up to that plate!
 So what's going on, then?
Lizzie: There are three events taking place during the festival: "Bullseye Balloons," "Floral Freefall," and "Ballads of Breeze".
Lizzie: As for the details... As opposed to having me explain, I think it might be easier if you try them out yourself.
Lizzie: As long as the preparations for the activity have already been made, I can tell you where they're being held.
Lizzie: May you have a happy Windblume Festival!
 Are there any other interesting things to do?
Lizzie: I've heard that the Adventurers' Guild has something special up their sleeve for the Windblume Festival.
Lizzie: If you're interested, I'd advise you to look for an adventurer named Plauen. He'll tell you all about it!
 Goodbye.
Lizzie: See you. Happy Windblume Festival!

Windblume's Breath[]

(Before the event started)
Lizzie: Ah, I hope this event will go smoothly this time too...
 What are you working on?
Lizzie: I'm preparing to welcome guests here. We've got all sorts of fun activities lined up for the Windblume Festival.
Lizzie: But some of the events are being held outside the city due to the large areas needed, so without a guide to tell people where things are happening, some of them are going to miss out!
Lizzie: That's why I've been stationed here and put in charge of introducing the festival's activities to everyone.
 Well, tell me all about it.
 What activities have we got lined up?
Lizzie: There are three events taking place during the festival: "Ballads of Breeze," "Floral Pursuit," and "Breezy Snapshots."
Lizzie: The activity I'm in charge of, specifically, is "Ballads of Breeze." The other two representatives should also be at their stations and making some final preparations.
Lizzie: Everyone's pretty excited, so here's to the smooth running of this year's Windblume Festival.
Lizzie: May you have a happy time as well!
(During the event)
Lizzie: Would you like to play a song? As long as you do your best to keep up with the rhythm and beat, you'll be able to strum up a storm with ease.
Lizzie: Focus only on the wind around you and the lovely song you wish to play, and all your troubles will surely fade away.
 I'll give it a go now.
Lizzie: No problem. The scores are over here and ready for your perusal.
 I've got something else to do right now...
Lizzie: Oh, that's fine... You're welcome back any time, though!
