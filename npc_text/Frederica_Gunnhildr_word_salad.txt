They married and had two daughters together, Jean and Barbara. In time, a rift formed in their marriage and the two parted ways. Jean stayed with Frederica, while Barbara was raised by their father.[4] Frederica raised Jean to be the successor of the Gunnhildr Clan using a strict regimen[3] and allowed her daughter few frivolities; for Jean's birthday, Frederica would take her on a simple trip to Windrise instead of holding birthday parties.[5]
