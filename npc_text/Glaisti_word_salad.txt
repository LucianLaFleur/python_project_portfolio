Idle Quotes[]

 What should I use...
Media:VO Glaisti 01.ogg "Hmm, what kind of fodder should I use this time?"

Dialogue[]

Glaisti: My oh my, I really wonder what they like to eat. What shall I use as feed this time?
Glaisti: Ah, hello! It's been a while. Would you like to have some tea?
 Feed?
Glaisti: Ah, I see you heard me mumbling to myself...
Glaisti: Actually, I've been trying to raise Breacher Primuses recently, so I've been making plans to get acquainted with them — on friendly terms, of course.
 You can raise such creatures?
Glaisti: Well, they are gentle and cute little things — isn't it just like how humans own pets?
Glaisti: Sometimes, I feel my spirits lifted just from watching them walk around.
 Do you need any help preparing any feed?
Glaisti: Thanks for the kind offer, but I haven't used up all the current feed I'm using. I'm just wondering what I should use next.
Glaisti: They might suffer from unbalanced nutrition if they always eat only one thing, so I need to switch recipes frequently...
Glaisti: By the way, what do you think would make the best feed? Tidalga membrane, Beryl Conch organs, or dried Lumitoile skin?
 Are any of those nutritious in the first place...?
Glaisti: Uh, to be honest, I'm not sure either, but they might be nutritious to the Breacher Primuses, considering how happily they eat the stuff?
Glaisti: But if none of those options work, I might have to come up with something else...
 I've got other things to do right now...
Glaisti: Well then, guess I won't keep you. But if you've got the time and mind to, just stop by for a cup of hot tea.
