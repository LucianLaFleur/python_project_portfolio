 The best stall...
Media:VO Sahar 01.ogg "In my opinion, Jut's is the best store in the whole Bazaar."

Thoughts[]
Sahar's thoughts can be accessed by using Nahida's Elemental Skill, All Schemes to Know.

Media:VO Sahar All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Sahar: (I should go buy something from Jut's after work... Hmm... What should I buy?)
Dialogue[]

Sahar: Hi there, are you a traveler here to shop at the Grand Bazaar? I suggest you go to Jut's shop.
 Why's that?
Sahar: In Sumeru, spices are a must-buy, and Jut's is the best spice store you can find around.
Sahar: Not only the quality high, but the prices are very reasonable. He even sells the rare Padisarah!
Sahar: He also gives customers small gifts on occasion, so you definitely don't want to miss his store when you come to the Grand Bazaar.
 Thanks for the recommendation.
Sahar: You're welcome. I'm sure you'll love it there.
