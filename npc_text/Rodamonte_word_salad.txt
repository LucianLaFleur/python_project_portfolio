 This isn't about me...
Media:VO Rodamonte 01.ogg "Forget about me, this is about what you want."

Dialogue[]

Renaud: If I'm to be honest, you're a lot sturdier than I imagined...
Rodamonte: Assess as you wish. I don't care.
Renaud: ...Your rationality is most admirable, too. It is something I lack. But I can't help but worry about you — it must be hard, being unable to speak to those around you.
Rodamonte: I do not wish for their understanding. This is the price of keeping a secret.
Rodamonte: Also, are you done beating around the bush? Let's get to the meat of the matter. I'm busy.
Renaud: The meat of the matter... Um...
Renaud: So, uh, have you found anything else lately?
Rodamonte: You want it all?
Renaud: Well, of course I'd like to see them, too. I mean, I trust your decision-making, right?
Rodamonte: How did this become my decision? The key is your view. What do you say?
Renaud: Um, what should I say...
