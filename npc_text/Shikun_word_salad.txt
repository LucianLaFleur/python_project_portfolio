Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Shikun: Greetings, my guest! Our village is just a few more steps to the north if you follow this path!
 Distinguished guests?
Shikun: Every visitor is a guest, and we will do our best to host them.
Shikun: There's an extraordinary aura of elegance about you. You might bring us good fortune, I reckon, and that makes you an important guest indeed!
 What are you doing?
Shikun: Tradition dictates that those who're in good health must help their neighbors once they're done with their own work.
Shikun: Uncle Luo, the village elder, arranges our shifts. Several of us are in the south, and several more in the north, so we're always prepared.
Shikun: If anyone needs help, they only have to talk to us.
 So how is the pay calculated?
Shikun: Nah, it's not, we're way too close to worry about formalities like that!
Shikun: After we helped them out, the neighbors treated us to dinner and we had a few drinks together! That counts as payment!
Shikun: Yeah, I even moved a bunch of clothes and books for Deyin a couple of days ago, and he made some killer egg soup!
Shikun: If you have some time, you should go chat with him and let him tell you stories about Chenyu Vale!
(Obtain  Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup ×3)
 Goodbye.
Shikun: Farewell for now. Come find me anytime you need help.

Nighttime[]

Shikun: Once tonight's shift is over, I should be able to get in a few drinks with my brothers...
 You even do night shifts!?
Shikun: Hey, some tea farmers start toiling away at three or four in the morning! A helping hand's always welcome in that pitch darkness!
Shikun: Someone like me, who isn't busy but has plenty of energy to spare, is the perfect candidate for that sort of night shift. Call me and I'll be there!
Shikun: The wee hours are great for getting things done. It's so quiet, so you can work away without getting distracted!
 You've got lots of brothers then?
Shikun: Oh no, they're not actually my brothers! We're just a group of pals who work together regularly.
Shikun: I'm one of the younger ones, so I call them my big brothers!
Shikun: We often help our neighbors out, and in return, they've dubbed us the "Six Little Dragons of Qiaoying Village."
Shikun: I'm the fourth oldest, so that makes me "Fourth Dragon"! Haha...
Shikun: These past two years, Fifth and Sixth have left to work as a bodyguard and a boatman respectively. Third's found a job at Yilong Wharf...
Shikun: So it's usually just the three of us — First, Second, and little old Fourth — drinking and chatting about our families.
Shikun: As fulfilling as a hard day's work is, a lazy day's not a bad day either!
 Have fun then!
Shikun: Thanks, you too!
