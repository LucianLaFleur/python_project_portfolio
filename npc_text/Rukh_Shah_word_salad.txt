Dialogue[]

Rukh Shah: Hello.
 And you are...
Rukh Shah: I'm the Parchamdar for the Corps of Thirty, in charge of the Eremites in Sumeru City.
 About the Corps of Thirty...
Rukh Shah: The Corps of Thirty is probably among the oldest Eremites in Sumeru. The name came from its thirty founders.
Rukh Shah: We're currently responsible for Sumeru's defenses. Most tasks are assigned by the Akademiya, in addition to those from civilians.
Rukh Shah: Unlike other Eremites, its members wear a green scarf. Feel free to seek assistance from us in town.
Rukh Shah: But once you're out of town, watch out for the other Eremites. Even if you're in Port Ormos. They might not have good intentions.
 See you.
Rukh Shah: See you.

Event Dialogue[]
A Parade of Providence[]

Rukh Shah: It's not often that the Akademiya hosts an event like this. We need to increase the number of patrols inside the city for this special occasion.
Rukh Shah: This isn't even especially for the competition. In fact, it is the increase in tourists that require us to take additional care.
Rukh Shah: There are no shortage of devious people who are willing to take advantage of these festivities to mask their own nefarious deeds.

Trivia[]
"Parchamdar" is a Persian word meaning Standard-bearer. In other words, it's the leading person of the organization.
