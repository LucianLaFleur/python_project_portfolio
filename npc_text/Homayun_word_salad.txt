Dialogue[]

(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Homayun: If the present rainforest could not fight off pollution, we could only try to change the surrounding environment...
Homayun: Gotta go to the House of Daena and request some previous research... Or go ask Rifaet.
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Homayun: We cannot rest on our laurels even though the pollution of the rainforest has decreased...
Homayun: I must go to the House of Daena and request to requisition some previous research... Or go ask Rifaet.
 What are you thinking about?
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Homayun: The Withering has always been one of the tough issues that Amurta wanted to conquer.
Homayun: It is true that while vision holders and forest rangers are working together to control the zones, the Withering won't impact Sumeru people's daily lives all too much.
Homayun: But beyond dealing with the symptoms, we researchers want to cure the cause.
Homayun: To this end, I've always wanted the Scribe to sort through the latest rainforest reports from the researchers.
Homayun: The Scribe is only responsible for documenting their findings, but he'd be able to discern any anomalies with his keen eyes...
 What are you thinking about?
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Homayun: Rainforest life is among the foremost concerns of the Amurta.
Homayun: Although the taint caused by the Withering has been greatly alleviated, no one can say for sure that no new problems will arise.
Homayun: To this end, I've always wanted the Scribe to sort through the latest rainforest reports from the researchers.
Homayun: The Scribe is mainly responsible for documenting their findings, true. But I reckon he'd be able to discern any anomalies in those writings with his keen eyes...
 About Rifaet...
Homayun: Oh? He's a very knowledgeable young researcher. He's not very articulate, but he's familiar with all kinds of literature. Have you heard of him?
 I've heard of him...
Homayun: How rare. He's been absorbed in research and barely shows up around here.
Homayun: If it weren't for the fact that he's a candidate for the next Grand Conservator, even fewer young researchers would know about him.
 Never heard of him...
Homayun: Well, he's been absorbed in research and barely shows up around here. That Vikram always steals the limelight.
Homayun: If it weren't for the fact that he's a candidate for the next Grand Conservator, not many would have heard his name.
Homayun: I prefer him though, compared to that Vikram fellow. Rifaet is more like a researcher in my opinion.
Homayun: But I don't know what those sages think. After all, they're the ones who have the final say.
 See you.
Homayun: Okay, goodbye.

Event Dialogue[]
A Parade of Providence[]

Homayun: Even if we find a calm place to think, we will inevitably be interrupted by noisy students.
Homayun: To be honest, I was never interested in these celebratory events or competitions when I was in the Akademiya.
Homayun: Winning the Championship doesn't really help add any credit to your research, and any renown gained from it only amounts to some short-lived attention.
Homayun: ...Realistically speaking, there are few people as practical as I am.
