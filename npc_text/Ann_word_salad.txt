Profile[]
Ann is an Oceanid created by the consciousness of Mary-Ann in the hopes of seeing how the world has "changed" over the past few years.[1] It is later revealed that Ann was born when the Oceanid Lyris accidentally absorbed the personality of Mary-Ann, during a battle between the Marechaussee Hunters and the Narzissenkreuz Ordo within Elynas. The merged consciousness of Lyris and Mary-Ann became the Oceanid "Mary-Ann," who constructed the dream world of Annapausis and accidentally created Ann through these dreams (a form of Oceanid reproduction, as theorized by Caterpillar).[2] As a result, Ann possesses the memories of both the real Mary-Ann and Lyris.

Appearance[]
Being a smaller version of an Oceanid, she shares a similar appearance to Endora.

Dialogue[]

(Upon completing Initial Facts)
Ann: Knight (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)...
 About the current situation...
Ann: I believe I've recalled certain... some very vague feelings. I am not sure they can even be called memories...
Ann: Though I don't know whether humans keep their memories in their heads or in their heart...
Ann: But Oceanids seem to have neither a brain nor a heart, just water...
Ann: If only I could be like that silly dog, just sit there and mumble stuff like "Drive Defragmenting" to recall everything...
 I want to know more about you, Ann...
Ann: I don't know what else I can tell you...
Ann: I'm the part of Mary-Ann that was imagined into being here, but... but she rejected me, and the others as well... I mean, other existences...
Ann: The Princess Lyris I want to rescue does not exist. "Mary-Ann" is also not Mary-Ann, and isn't that silly dog's owner.
Ann: I don't know why, but when I see that silly dog, something just swells inside of me... It feels like bubbles! But they burst whenever I get close to remembering...
Ann: Caterpillar seems to know something, but he won't say much if he's not 100% sure.
Ann: We came to the place with Narzissenkreuz in its name, yet nothing was resolved...
 I want to know more about Princess Lyris...
Ann: Princess Lyris is kind and courageous. That's why she endangered herself... in order to protect her friends.
Ann: Before, all I thought was that I must have been a friend of hers and she protected me, so now that's she's in trouble, I have to save her.
Ann: Even though she might not want me to do that... because she is too nice, and would suffer than let her friends be in danger.
Ann: But if I don't save her, how could I be worthy of being her friend or deserve her protection?
Ann: "Memories"... They're hazy, like whirlpools in water. Emotions and desires, on the other hand, feel so real, despite me realizing she's just a character in a story now...
 It's all right. Just go to bed.
Ann: Okay. Goodnight, Knight (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
