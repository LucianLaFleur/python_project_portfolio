Profile[]
Knotty is a Treasure Hoarder who was sent to Dragonspine to find a way to potential treasure. He found nothing and was met with the unexpected harsh cold of the mountain. He refuses to give in to the temptation of visiting the nearby campsite for warm food due to his pride as an elite Treasure Hoarder, and is also aware that the reputation of one would not be welcomed.

  "Ugh, it's so cold..."
Media:VO Knotty 01.ogg "Ugh, it's so cold... If only I could get a bowl of hot soup."

Dialogue[]

Knotty: So cold... Huh? Is that someone trying to talk to me, or is it the cold making me delirious again?
Knotty: ...Okay, I guess I wasn't hallucinating after all. Well, what is it?
 Who might you be?
Knotty: What, can't you tell? I'm an elite member of the Treasure Hoarders... Achoo!
Knotty: ...Our boss reckons that this inhospitable mountain must be home to lots of treasure, and I was sent here to scout out the way... Never expected it to be this cold, though.
Knotty: Hmph. You here for the treasure too?
Knotty: Go if you want to, I'm not going to stop you. But once you do, you'll know just how cold this place is... Achoo!
 Are you alright?
Knotty: This place is terrifying... I went up the mountain once — not only did I find nothing, but I've basically turned into a popsicle to boot...
Knotty: Man, I could go for a bowl of hot soup right about now...
Knotty: ...Ah, that's good stuff. Can you smell that?
Knotty: There's a campsite just ahead, and the chef there is always making soup. I can smell it from all the way over here...
 Why don't you go have a bowl?
Knotty: I know what our reputation's like around here. Everyone thinks we're a bunch of reprobate crooks...
Knotty: ...Well, if that's what we are, then we should act the part! I'm an elite member to boot. How can I just act all meek and mild over a bowl of soup...
Knotty: Achoo! Achoo! ACHOO!
Knotty: Ugh, a bowl of hot soup in this weather would be an archon-send and no mistake...
Knotty: ...N—No! This is a matter of pride. A test of will! I will not give in. I can't... give in...
 Well, goodbye, and good luck.
Knotty: Oh, just scram alread— Achoo! ACHOO!
