Fan Er'ye's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Fan Er'ye is a retired opera singer and actor of great renown, having performed with Granny Ruoxin.[1] He fell in love with her, but she was infatuated with another man and eventually retired to Qingce Village, where she promised to spend the rest of her days with him. However, the man never returned from his expedition, leaving Fan Er'ye wistful for what could have been if he had mustered up the courage to confess to her.

Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Fan Er'ye: That was fantastic! What a blast...
 About Rex Lapis' death...
(After Rite of Descension)
Fan Er'ye: Away with you! I don't care if the sky is falling, I'll worry about it after the story ends!
Fan Er'ye: Wait... Rex Lapis, you say?
Fan Er'ye: That's... possibly just as bad as the sky falling!
Fan Er'ye: How did you hear about this?
 Hello.
Fan Er'ye: Shh, listen to this! It's a real blast!
 Hello?
Fan Er'ye: I told you to shush! What could you possibly want that you can't wait until the story is finished!?
 Goodbye...
Fan Er'ye: Encore, encore!

Nighttime[]

Fan Er'ye: Here for the show? Come on in and take a seat!
 Sir, might I know your name?
Fan Er'ye: "Sir"? No need to be so polite on my account! Just call me Er'ye. Pronounced "Ah yeah!"
Fan Er'ye: I'm the boss of this tea house here. Is everything to your liking?
 About the tea shop...
Fan Er'ye: What do you think of the place? Let me tell you something, that stage, these tables and chairs, the private rooms upstairs, the performers, the kitchen staff...
Fan Er'ye: I was the one who made it all what it is today. I paid my dues when I was young... Granny Ruoxin and I used to sing together on that stage all the time.
Fan Er'ye: Eventually I made a name for myself and saw some success. Enough to buy the place up myself. Now I run it.
Fan Er'ye: Granny Ruoxin? Hehehe, oh how times change. Put it this way, forty years ago she was no less of an acting sensation than Yun Jin is today!
Fan Er'ye: Sadly, she had her heart stolen by some adventurer in green clothing who never came back for her. Poor thing, she's had no one to rely on her whole life...
Fan Er'ye: May things could have been different if I had only told her the way I felt... But I digress. No use in digging up the past.
 About Xingyan...
(After On the Stage, Behind the Stage)‍[Unlock condition]
Fan Er'ye: Xingyan? What? Who's that?
 She's Yun Jin's friend...
 She's your adopted daughter...
Fan Er'ye: Oh, right, yes! I mean, I am getting on years, you know? Starting to forget and all, haha!
Fan Er'ye: Ah, but it's getting late, isn't it? My dear Xingyan might be calling it a night soon, in fact. What would you like to ask her?
 If she'd like to go see a rock 'n' roll concert.
Fan Er'ye: ...Hah, so Ms. Yun sent you.
Fan Er'ye: Ah, Ms. Yun... Whenever she wants to go out to see a rock concert, she has to find some excuse to prevent those old codgers in the troupe from finding out.
Fan Er'ye: Imagine that, eh? A man at my age, going on with various deceptions, exchanging code-words, doing things in secret...
Fan Er'ye: ...Actually, it's all rather exciting.
 Goodbye.
Fan Er'ye: Won't you stay? Suit yourself, take care now!

Event Dialogue[]
Fleeting Colors in Flight[]
Nighttime

Fan Er'ye: Here for the show? Come on in and take a seat!
Fan Er'ye: Have you gone to see Ms. Yun's new opera? Ah, she truly is Liyue Harbor's superstar — there's no arguing that point!
Fan Er'ye: It's just that each time I watch her perform, I am always reminded about those things that happened in the past... *sigh*
