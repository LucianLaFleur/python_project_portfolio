Dialogue[]

Nevida: Hello. What can I do for you?
 Are you working?
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Nevida: Correct, the Bimarstan and neighboring areas are under my jurisdiction.
Nevida: Don't be nervous, I primarily monitor the doctors and patients, so there is no "inadvertent" breach of confidentiality.
Nevida: The Akademiya distributes information on a need-to-know basis through the Akasha Terminal, so extra leaks could cause unwanted problems.
Nevida: It would be great if you would work with our mandate and report anything unusual at once.
 Are you working at the moment?
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Nevida: That's correct. The Bimarstan and areas near it are under my jurisdiction.
Nevida: Do not fret, though. Now that Akasha has been shut down, I will no longer interfere in the exchange of knowledge between the doctors and their patients.
Nevida: What I am focusing on at present is whether dialog between doctors and patients is going smoothly, and whether medical supplies are being effectively distributed or not.
Nevida: Please cooperate with us Mahamata and make sure to report anything unusual to us at once.
 Excuse me.
Nevida: It's all right.
