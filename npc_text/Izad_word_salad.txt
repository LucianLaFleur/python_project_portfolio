Media:VO Izad All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Izad: (If only the rainforest's environment was also doing so well... But then I guess the Forest Rangers would be out of their jobs.)

Dialogue[]

Izad: An unusual floral fragrance permeates the air... I really would love to stay a little longer.
 Is there anything of note nearby?
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Izad knows; Version 1)

Izad: I heard from some students passing by that some ores appeared in a place nearby. They were so absorbed in discussing a problem that they didn't watch where they were going and tripped over some Magical Crystal Ores.
Izad: I could help clean them up if I had my tools with me... I can tell you the location if you want to check it out.
Izad: Ores are pretty useful. You need them too, right?
(Rich Ore Reserves marked on the map)

(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Izad knows)

Izad: If you like flora and fauna, there are plenty of things to see.
Izad: But it's impossible for me to name every one of them... Hehe, best to ask a Forest Watcher for that.
 And you are...
Izad: I'm a Forest Ranger of Avidya Forest. I'm in charge of liaison between the Forest Rangers and Pardis Dhyai.
Izad: We send regular reports on the ecological situation in Avidya Forest to Pardis Dhyai, and Pardis Dhyai provides us with all kinds of assistance.
Izad: For example, we recently received quite a bit of seeds and nutrients that Pardis Dhyai supplied for free.
Izad: The Forest Rangers are in charge of selecting suitable planting areas or distributing the seeds to the nearby villagers, so that we can all add a little more green to the rainforest.
 See you.
Izad: Slow down and appreciate the flowers and plants here.
