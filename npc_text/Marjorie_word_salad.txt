Dialogue[]

Marjorie: Welcome. Every treasure here is unique, so we don't negotiate on the price, nor do we give refunds.
 Browse items. (Prior to unlocking shop)
Marjorie: My, this is unfortunate. The shop's been undergoing renovations recently.
Marjorie: Drop by next time. Our products will never disappoint!
 Browse items.
Marjorie: Take a look around. Let me know if you're interested in any of these.
(Opens Souvenir Shop)
 Adventure Challenge
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Marjorie: Well, it looks like you need more practice.
(If the player wins the match)

Marjorie: Whoa. You're better than the regulars here...
 I'd like to get some special souvenirs, please.
Marjorie: Well, then you've come to the right place. Have a look, see if anything takes your fancy!
(Opens Special Souvenir Shop)
 I'd like to ask about something.
Marjorie: Oh? I see you're very interested.
 Tell me about your wares.
Marjorie: Which one caught your eyes? Every item here is unique. Every purchase here is a bargain!
Marjorie: They were all purchased from the adventurers. Each of them represents the passion and courage of these adventurers—
Marjorie: So don't bother asking for a discount. You can never discount passion and courage!
 How did you come to own this shop?
Marjorie: Why did I open this shop, you ask? It's because of my dad.
Marjorie: He's the Master of the Adventurers' Guild, Mondstadt Branch. He always brings tons of treasures after each adventure.
Marjorie: He'll then tell me the story behind each of the treasures... He was my hero when I was little.
Marjorie: I wanted to share these stories with everyone, so I opened this shop—
Marjorie: But not long after opening, my dad became a bit more doddery and talks to himself all day...
 Did I hear you talk about Wolvendom?
Marjorie: Oh, yes. I did see something strange in Wolvendom not long ago.
Marjorie: From the silhouette, it seems to have been a boy, but he was with a pack of wolves, and they seemed very close, too...
Marjorie: Perhaps I was mistaken. I was quite a distance away, after all, and it was only a glimpse.
Marjorie: I mean, how could humans live alongside wolves? How strange...
 Goodbye.
Marjorie: Oh! Don't forget to bring some goodies here next time!

Event Dialogue[]
Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness[]

 We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.
Marjorie: A music festival? Didn't we just hold the Windblume Festival?
Paimon: This one's taking place in Inazuma, Marjorie, and it's a serious musical exchange! If you've got any tunes you like, we can play it for you right here and now.
Marjorie: Hmm, let me think... Well, I don't remember this one's name, but could you play it if I were to just to hum the tune?
 Sure, I'll give it a go.
Marjorie: Oh, that'd be grand!
(After performing)
Marjorie: This tune is so gentle, just the way I remember it.
Marjorie: My dad used to play this one for me on his harmonica while we were on the way back from Springvale.
Marjorie: He said that this tune represented Springvale itself, and that's where Dad's dad grew up.
Marjorie: Shame that my grandfather would pass before I was ever born.
Marjorie: Thanks for playing that music. You know what? I've decided that I should spend a bit more time with my dad. He's an adventurer, so he tends to spend time out in the field.
Marjorie: So, if you don't mind, I might have to give this festival a pass, but if there's another opportunity, I'll come — and drag him along as well!
(Talk to Marjorie again, optional)
 How was that?
(Same as After performing)

Windblume's Breath[]

Marjorie: "A flower that is not of this world"... Could that be referring to the real Windblume?
Marjorie: Ah, I'm sorry, I was preoccupied with thinking about something.
Marjorie: An adorable child bought a storybook from me, but I remember there being a rather strange riddle within its pages.
Marjorie: It might've been something that someone just accidentally left behind. You don't need to pay any special heed to it.
(Dialogue options and responses are the same as normal)
