Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available prior to completing World Quest Both Brains and Brawn.


Roussimoff: Have you come to the ring to work up a sweat, too? Respect!
 About Pankration...
Roussimoff: It's a very healthy sport!
Roussimoff: If you ask me, you really lose out by being the host! Sure, you get the best seat in the house, but do you think I want to just be watching?
Roussimoff: I want to get in the ring too, and go head-to-head with the best opponents!
Roussimoff: Though when I say it like that, it does seem to lack a bit of theatricality, which hand-to-hand combat only has so much of in the first place. I'll have to come up with some other limitations...
 About the Fortress of Meropide...
Roussimoff: Heh, it's more my speed than the Fleuve Cendre is.
Roussimoff: It's not that the Fleuve Cendre's bad, I just prefer it here. No matter how you look at it, the Fleuve Cendre just doesn't have any arenas as big as this one.
 I'm just looking around. See you.
Roussimoff: See ya!

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing World Quest Both Brains and Brawn.


Roussimoff: Oho, if it isn't the coach! Here to scope out potential fighters to take under your wing?
 About Pankration...

Roussimoff: Though when I say it like that, it does seem to lack a bit of theatricality, which hand-to-hand combat only has so much of in the first place. I'll have to come up with some other limitations...
Roussimoff: But on the other hand, we've been holding quite a few recreational matches recently. Maybe it's time to get back to the roots? Yeah, it's worth giving some serious thought.
 About the Fonta sponsorship...
Roussimoff: I'm not a fan of Fonta, it's too sweet. Pure Water, on the other hand, is pretty decent. Too bad the supply's unreliable.
Roussimoff: That Heinry's a good kid, though. As you know, the majority of people here have hit rock bottom... literally or figuratively, haha.
Roussimoff: If you bring a little sweetness into people's lives at a time like that, they'll never forget it once they turn over a new leaf and get out of this place. Don't you think?
 About the Fortress of Meropide...
Roussimoff: Heh, it's more my speed than the Fleuve Cendre is.
Roussimoff: It's not that the Fleuve Cendre's bad, I just prefer it here. No matter how you look at it, the Fleuve Cendre just doesn't have any arenas as big as this one.
 I'm just looking around. See you.
