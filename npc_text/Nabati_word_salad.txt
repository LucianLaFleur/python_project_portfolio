Dialogue[]

Nabati: Some research topic on folk beliefs... What's the point of that?
 What topic?
Nabati: It's about the belief of Children of the Forest near Vimara Village...
Nabati: According to my inference, it must be because wild vegetables grow luxuriantly here, and they were anthropomorphized... That's how the Children of the Forest came to be.
Nabati: *sigh* Jokes aside, this topic is far less interesting than studying the human body...
 Studying the human body...?
Nabati: Nah, it isn't as scary as you're thinking. It's just some extended topics on fighting techniques.
Nabati: How must the body be controlled to release unimaginable strength? Aren't you all curious about that?
Nabati: But while I've suggested it a few times, not a single mentor has been willing to approve it...
Nabati: So, I had no choice but to comply with my assignment and research this topic related to folk beliefs...
Nabati: I think this can't be allowed to go on. Someone must let the Akademiya know that there are many other research directions that are worth our attention.
 You can do it.
Nabati: Thanks for your encouragement. Knowing that there are still people who share my thoughts raises my confidence again.
Nabati: A researcher should have the courage and determination to speak their mind!
(Obtain  Guide to Admonition ×1)
 I have no idea.
Nabati: What a coincidence, me neither.
