Dialogue[]

Nishikino Reirei: Hello. If you're looking for me, you must need some medical attention, right?
Nishikino Reirei: Did you scrape a leg? Or do you have a flu or a fever? Make it quick, please.
 Uh, you are...
Nishikino Reirei: You can't tell? I'm a doctor.
Nishikino Reirei: No, I'm not from Watatsumi Island. My family's from Narukami Island. They're mostly in the medical profession, too.
 Why did you come to Watatsumi Island?
Nishikino Reirei: While working as a traveling doctor, I happened to save one of the Sangonomiya troops out in the wild, and heard about the situation here.
Nishikino Reirei: That they've managed to last this long without sufficient manpower or materiel [sic]... Should I call them determined, or overly eager to go it alone...
Nishikino Reirei: Well, now that I'm here, things have turned around a decent bit. These soldiers should get well... as long as they follow my advice instead of running around arbitrarily.
Nishikino Reirei: I just wish that the kids around here would be a bit less rowdy, and stop coming to me crying about broken arms and legs... I've got no time to entertain those little brats.
 You're a good person.
Nishikino Reirei: Huh? Wh—What are you saying all of a sudden?
Nishikino Reirei: A doctor saves lives. That's normal. Nothing more to it.
Nishikino Reirei: ...A—Anyway, just take this. Who knows, it might be of use to you at some point.
(Obtain 3★  Traveling Doctor's Handkerchief)
 Well, I won't bother you, then.
Nishikino Reirei: Right. Call me if you need me.
