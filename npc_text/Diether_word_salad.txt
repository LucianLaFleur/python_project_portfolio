 Where are they?
Media:VO Diether 01.ogg "Dad, where are all the water fairies? Are they even real?"

Dialogue[]

Diether: Daddy, they say in Springvale that Fontaine's the homeland of the water fairies, right?
Dietmar: Yes, that's right.
Diether: In that case, we'll definitely see them here, won't we?
Dietmar: We will, of course we will — and Daddy will help you find them!
Dietmar: But I asked some of the locals, and they say that Oceanids are very shy, and that we need to work hard to see them with our own eyes.
Dietmar: You're a good, patient lad, aren't you, Diether? You'll wait for Daddy to find them, right?
Diether: Sure, of course!
