Profile[]
Oleg is among the Fatui working on Il Dottore's projects in Sumeru. Unlike Alphonso's (Trofin Snezhevich's) group, which aimed at capturing the Aranara as part of Il Dottore's interest in utilizing the power of dreams, Oleg attempted to harness the power of The Withering. To that end, he collaborated with "Kasim the Bandit," allegedly a notorious Eremite bandit who possessed Energy Extraction Devices called "Saghira Machines," which were capable of extracting energy from The Withering.
After the Traveler disrupted the devices set up at eight Eremite camps, they discover Oleg and Kasim. Kasim flees while Oleg attempts to fight them off, but retreats after being defeated. In his haste, he drops an "Emergency Adjustment Plan" allowing the Traveler to track him down another two times, much to his bewilderment. After the third beating, Oleg retreats to his stronghold, leaving the Traveler to track down Kasim instead.
After defeating Kasim, and if the Traveler coerces the truth out of him, it turns out that Oleg was being deceived all along. While Oleg had approached Kasim under the belief that he was a notorious Eremite bandit, Kasim's guise was only maintained as a result of the work he did for the Fatui outside of Sumeru. Kasim's so-called "Saghira Machines" were actually devices developed to extract Ley Line energy by the expelled Sumeru Akademiya researcher Abattouy. Regardless of whether the Traveler finds out the truth, they learn that Kasim had no idea whether the Energy Extraction Devices worked as intended, and eventually discovered the whereabouts of the Fatui stronghold as well as the Fatui's watchword.
The Traveler disguised themselves with the Fatui mask Diluc gave them during Chasing Shadows and made their way to the stronghold. Oleg, who was keeping watch, was initially surprised to see them but curbs his surprise and lets them in after they give the correct watchword. While making their way inside the stronghold, Oleg berates them as if they were new recruits, only to reveal that he had lured them into a trap. After his defeat, Paimon and the Traveler reveal how he was tricked and have him arrested by Rukh Shah.
