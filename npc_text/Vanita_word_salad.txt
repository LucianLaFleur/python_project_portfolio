Dialogue[]

Vanita: ...
 Hello.
Vanita: Hello.
Vanita: ...
Vanita: Sorry, my colleagues and I are not good at small talk. It's easy to get distracted by talking after all.
Vanita: This is the Wikala Funduq. Many people come here to do business every day. Interest rates can incite disputes, so this place must be strictly guarded.
Vanita: Oh, right, I must also remind you that if you are new to the city, it's best not to trust those who wear the uniform of the Eremites.
Vanita: Especially those who peddle dangerous goods related to obtaining knowledge. They are driven by money and are not afraid to cross the lines considered unforgivable by the Akademiya.
 See you.
Vanita: See you.
