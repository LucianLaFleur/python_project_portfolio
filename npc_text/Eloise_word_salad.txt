 So annoyed...
Media:VO Eloise 01.ogg "Ugh, I'm so annoyed."

Dialogue[]

Eloise: Hmm? Is something the matter?
 In a bad mood, perhaps?
Eloise: Hmph. Thanks for asking.
Eloise: I was just here for a quick meal — not to have a waiter look down his nose at me for picking the wrong wine to go with my food!
Eloise: I mean, aren't both Chardon and Corte white wines? Why do people have to make such a hue and cry about something as simple as a meal?
Eloise: The most infuriating thing is that when I tried to resolve the situation by following his recommendation, not only was the price cheaper, but the flavor really was better than the one I'd picked originally.
Eloise: I mean, I should've thanked him, but his attitude really was... Darn it.
 What are you thinking about?
(Before completing Masquerade of the Guilty)

Eloise: Why are our legal systems and court processes the way they are?
Eloise: I've been to other nations, and upon learning their laws, I've come to find our theatrical trials less and less bearable.
Eloise: Such drama denigrates the law and affects the development of art... What in the world are the higher-ups thinking?
(After completing Masquerade of the Guilty)

Eloise: I just feel there are some subtle changes underway with Fontaine's legal systems and judicial processes.
Eloise: I've been to other nations and studied their systems. And since, I've come to find our theatrical trials less and less bearable.
Eloise: But I do think there's been less theatrics lately. Our visitors seem to be coming to learn about the law, rather than to see a spectacle.
Eloise: Or am I wrong? I'll have to keep observing.
 Nothing.
Eloise: See you.

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
