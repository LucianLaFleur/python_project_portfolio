Profile[]
Daisuke and his parents, Misuzu and Sugimoto, live in Inazuma City.[2] Their house was attacked by Nogata and his gang of vagrants (including the Blue Oni Takuya). Daisuke's parents were kidnapped, but Daisuke had been playing outside the house and was initially not noticed. When Daisuke returned, Arataki Itto managed to save him by chasing off the vagrants. Itto took Daisuke with him to Yashiori Island to protect him from the vagrants, taking responsibility for the crimes onto himself.[2]
When the Traveler went to Yashiori Island on commission to capture Itto, they instead helped Itto find an Onikabuto for a play beetle fight; Paimon also found a beetle of her own. Daisuke soundly defeated Itto (to Itto's great shock), but Paimon won against him afterwards. Paimon offered her beetle to him afterwards, and Itto encouraged him to take it and stay with Granny Oni, not wanting Daisuke to know that the Traveler was sent to capture Itto. However, Daisuke had already figured it out as he seen all the members of the Arataki Gang and knew they were not part of it, and he begged for them to leave Itto alone.
The Traveler and Itto later defeat the vagrants and rescue their captives, allowing Misuzu and Sugimoto to reunite with Daisuke, though Itto is arrested by Ishizaki for attacking Tenryou Commission officers. When Daisuke hears about this, he is happy that "Uncle Itto" was proven innocent of the kidnappings and expresses hope to play with him again in the future. Daisuke and his parents leave afterwards.
