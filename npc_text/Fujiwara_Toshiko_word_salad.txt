Fujiwara Toshiko's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Toshiko's ancestors lived on Seirai Island up until 500 years ago, during which a certain incident caused by Asase Hibiki[1] led the Inazuma Shogunate to force an evacuation. Most of the island's inhabitants were relocated to Narukami Island, unaware of what exactly had happened on their home island. As a result, Toshiko believes that the Shogunate had forced them to move out of greed for the treasures supposedly hidden on the island, and wishes to return to Seirai someday.
During the World Quest Reminiscence of Seirai, Oda Tarou mentions Toshiko after the Traveler brings him the photos.

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing Relics of Seirai)
Fujiwara Toshiko: Hello, adventurer from afar. What business do you have with me?
 You could tell that I'm an adventurer?
Fujiwara Toshiko: Don't get me wrong, I don't really know who you are. But I can tell from your gear. You look like someone who often goes out on adventures.
Fujiwara Toshiko: Although I am not in the same line of work as you, I am still a descendant of pirates after all. I have pretty keen eyes.
 Are you looking for treasure?
Fujiwara Toshiko: Oh, so you heard about that? I do have a treasure map from my ancestors. The treasure it leads to will belong to me and no one else.
Fujiwara Toshiko: However, my ancestors were the pirates who once occupied Seirai Island. The clues on the treasure map... are probably still on that island.
Fujiwara Toshiko: Hmph, it's all the Kanjou Commission's fault. They came up with some stupid reasons to force the island's residents out. Now I have no use for this treasure map.
Fujiwara Toshiko: Come to think of it, there's been a legend of a pirate treasure circulating for generations on Seirai Island... After my ancestors left, could the Kanjou Commission have already taken the treasure for themselves?
 Goodbye.
Fujiwara Toshiko: Okay, goodbye.

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After completing Relics of Seirai)
Fujiwara Toshiko: Hello there. Can I help you with something?
 When did you get back?
Fujiwara Toshiko: I came straight back once the previous incident concluded.
Fujiwara Toshiko: We didn't find anything valuable, no... But I couldn't have stayed on that island a second longer.
 Regarding the treasure...
Fujiwara Toshiko: Ugh, let's not even go there. I took that picture and asked around a bit, but there's nothing special about it. It's really just an ordinary picture.
Fujiwara Toshiko: But that's what I don't get. Why would people go to such lengths to conceal a simple picture?
Fujiwara Toshiko: After unlocking all those mechanisms, that was all we found. In fact, I doubt that this was the treasure I was looking for at all!
Fujiwara Toshiko: Did I read the treasure map wrong or something? Or is something wrong with the treasure map? Where is the real treasure located?
Fujiwara Toshiko: ...Did the Kanjou Commission take it for themselves, by any chance?
 Goodbye.
Fujiwara Toshiko: Okay, goodbye.
