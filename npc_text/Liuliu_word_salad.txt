Ruins Investigation Logs[]
Main article: Ruins Investigation Logs
Logs are listed in known chronological order.

Lingju Pass[]

Ruins Investigation Log: "...Research suggests that the ruins here have an incredibly long history stretching back to time immemorial."
Ruins Investigation Log: "It seems that this was originally a castle built during wartime. A stronghold where mortals and adepti fought jointly to defend Liyue together. Also, something about... Rex Lapis' "lingju."
Ruins Investigation Log: "So I didn't understand every last detail. But basically, the ruins are pretty ancient. So I'll wager there's some sort of undiscovered treasure still in there somewhere. And if there used to be adepti here, then who knows; maybe some of their good luck will have rubbed off on it."
Ruins Investigation Log: "I'd better go investigate. The monsters occupying this territory have overwhelmed me and driven me out a few times already, but I can't exactly give up when there's treasure to be found and still call myself one of the Treasure Hoarders with a straight face. Speaking of monsters, looks like another bunch of hilichurls is headed this way..."
Paimon: ...Yikes. D'you think the guy who wrote this is okay?

Dunyu Ruins[]

Ruins Investigation Log: "Things went totally pear shaped at Lingju Pass. This time, I've decided to set up camp within sight of a Statue of the Seven [sic], maybe it'll bring me good luck."
Ruins Investigation Log: "Research suggests that these ruins are connected to adepti who fought and died in an ancient war. I think the line went something like this: 'Hidden within the rocks, concealed beneath the waters.'"
Ruins Investigation Log: "So you can bet there's gotta be a ton of treasure in these ruins. What else would they be hiding in the rocks and concealing in the waters?"
Ruins Investigation Log: "Whenever I'm out investigating, I always get this feeling like somebody's watching me. And at night, I hear these faint, mournful groans... Ah, it's probably just the north wind making creepy noises as it blows past Nantianmen."
Ruins Investigation Log: "Come on Liuliu, pull yourself together. You're a Treasure Hoarder! You can't let every little thing like this get under your skin."

Wuwang Hill[]

Ruins Investigation Log: "...studies show that these ruins date back to very ancient times indeed; they are older than the collective age of all the elderly residents of Qingce Village put together."
Ruins Investigation Log: "In other words, we find these ruins to be entirely generic, indistinguishable in substance from other ruins."
Ruins Investigation Log: "Yet despite their generic nature, the majority of these ruins contain treasure. Though driven out by the Ruin Hunters here, the allure of the treasure contained within will be sure to see the Treasure Hoarders return."
Ruins Investigation Log: "According to Chang the Ninth, who lives on the mountain, there was once an old town below. Once it was destroyed there was... what was it... something that was sealed away underground. Something to do with some kind of golden stone..."
Ruins Investigation Log: "But he's a destitute scholar who loves citing the classics and going off on tangents. Added to the fact that I drank a lot with him to get the conversation going, I can't remember what he said very clearly. I think the crux of it was that it had something to do with some golden stone and Ruin Hunters... That old man really can drink a lot."
Ruins Investigation Log: "The heavy drinking and the bitterly cold wind have left my head feeling like it's been bashed about by a bunch of hilichurls."
Ruins Investigation Log: "Actually now I think about it... Maybe I really did get attacked by hilichurls on my way down the mountain last night? I can't remember for sure... My head sure does hurt though. Better get myself to a doctor in Liyue Harbor before thinking any more about these ruins."

Trivia[]
During the Event Story Quest Currents Deep Beneath the Lanterns in Lantern Rite: Part II, using Elemental Sight on the man named "???" reveals his name as "Treasure Hoarder – Liuliu". Oddly enough, however, his letter, when translated back from the common Teyvat language, is riddled with misspellings — a trait the other notes left by Liuliu did not have, this is possibly done on purpose indicating the two of them are entirely different people.
