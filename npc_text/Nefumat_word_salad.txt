Nefumat was one of the many slaves conscripted from the desert populace during Parvezravan's reign. He was the lover of Etta, a conscripted maid, and he hoped that they would one day be able to escape their suffering under Parvezravan.[1] They were conscripted on the same day and sent to work at two different sites in the Hypostyle Desert.
The two managed to meet several times by giving various excuses to be absent from work, which are transcribed in the sites' leave of absence tablets as happening on the same days with the same excuses. On the 26th day, Nefumat fled from his worksite and was branded a fugitive, to be expelled from Gurabad. It is suggested that he fled to Etta's worksite: that day, Etta convinced the overseers at her worksite to allow a "very clever friend" of hers to work there, which was accepted.[2][3]
Nefumat and Etta were likely the parents of the unnamed architect of Aaru's Shut, who called himself the "product of a tryst between a fugitive and a maid." The architect's father died during the destruction of Gurabad orchestrated by Liloupar, though the architect and his mother both survived.[4]
