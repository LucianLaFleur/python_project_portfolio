Dialogue[]

(After completing The Strange Tale of Suikou's Tipsy Tincture)
Kousaka: Seriously, though, what are these "fan novel" things?
Kousaka: Every time I ask the people around here, I get dirty looks. What's with that?
Kousaka: Also, I've been listening to the discussions between people in the queues, and while I recognize every word they say, the sentences that are formed make no sense to me...
