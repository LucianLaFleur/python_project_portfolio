Bulle Fruit-Hued Interloper![]
 Quest DescriptionA certain special guest suddenly arrives at the Furball Fortress a short while into its trial operations, leaving Valerina in a panic...

(Approach the Throne of Meower in the Furball Fortress after passing time)
Big Ferocious Cat: *hiss*
Media:vo mkeq002b 1 valerina 01.ogg Valerina: *whimper*... The cat is hissing at me, Miss Rosaria! I'm scared!
Media:vo mkeq002b 1 rosaria 01.ogg Rosaria: You should probably give him some space. Get too close, and all that swatting might catch you in the face.
Media:vo mkeq002b 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh oh, seems like Valerina has run into some more cat-sized trouble...
 Looks like the shelter has a new stray...
 There's something almost... dignified about him...
Media:vo mkeq002b 1 valerina 02.ogg Valerina: Honorary Knight! Cat Whisperer! This big cat just barged in here after Snowball! He must have spotted her when she went out for a walk and followed her all the way back here...
Media:vo mkeq002b 1 rosaria 02.ogg Rosaria: Easy, easy. No one's going to hurt you here.
Media:vo mkeq002b 1 rosaria 03.ogg Rosaria: All those evil things, all those bad people who forced you to do whatever it took to survive... They can't find you here. You're safe within these walls.
Media:vo mkeq002b 1 rosaria 04.ogg Rosaria: You're surrounded by good people now. Their constant hovering might get a little annoying, but it's all for your own good. Just relax. A life of leisure isn't a bad thing, you know. You just have to get used to it.
Big Ferocious Cat: *hiss*... *whimper*
Media:vo mkeq002b 1 valerina 03.ogg Valerina: H—He understood all that?
Media:vo mkeq002b 1 rosaria 05.ogg Rosaria: Looks like it worked. Hah, smart cat.
Media:vo mkeq002b 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Woah, this cat is waaay bigger than the others. His coloring looks like fresh-squeezed Bulle Fruit juice! And he's wearing a scarf too! Huh, looks like there's some sort of design on it... Oh! It's the symbol of the Knights of Favonius!
Media:vo mkeq002b 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: He deserves a name fit for a knight, then! Hmm, he's pretty feisty. How about "Sir Pouncelot"?
Sir Pouncelot: Meow!
Media:vo mkeq002b 1 rosaria 06.ogg Rosaria: You really do have a way with cats. He looks way more at ease now.
Media:vo mkeq002b 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Paimon thinks you deserves to take the credit this time. Sir Pouncelot seemed to calm right down after everything you said to him!
 You're getting much better with them, Rosaria!
 Hopefully you're finding this gig a bit more fun, too!
Media:vo mkeq002b 1 rosaria 07.ogg Rosaria: It doesn't matter to me either way. Although... The fact that they're cute doesn't hurt.
Media:vo mkeq002b 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Let Paimon show you how to put Sir Pouncelot completely at ease! Paimon just needs to work a bit more of her magic, and he'll be as happy as can be!

Sir Pouncelot Joins the Lot![]
 Quest DescriptionYour tireless work as cat saviors has seen your great cat guest grow gentle and well-behaved...However, its mode of dress indicates that it still has quite the story to tell...

(Approach the Throne of Meower in the Furball Fortress)
Sir Pouncelot: Meeoww.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Awww, that's a good kitty, Sir Pouncelot!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: You better be on your best behavior from now on, okay? Don't go causing trouble now. Hehe, Paimon knows you're a sweet, happy little cat. You'll get along with everyone just fine.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 valerina 01.ogg Valerina: He's so adorable! I just wanna scratch his head and pinch his little cheeks!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 rosaria 01.ogg Rosaria: He does have a certain endearing quality about him... when he's not causing trouble, that is. Hmm, I wonder how he got that injury around his eye...
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: The traces of the restorative potion indicate that Sir Pouncelot should be in the vicinity.
(If the player has not met Albedo yet, an introductory note appears on screen)Albedo — KreideprinzAlbedo is Chief Alchemist and Captain of the Investigation Team of the Knights of Favonius. His groundbreaking achievements in the field of alchemy have earned him a reputation as a genius.Not one to socialize, the genius researcher is usually seen wearing the same calm, cool expression. Only when he is buried in his research does his more energetic and enthusiastic side seem to emerge.Soil and chalk... Albedo spends much time alone, pondering profound alchemical conundrums, but there seems to be no end in sight to his research.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Oh, it's (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), Paimon, and Sister Rosaria... Ah, and you must be an adventurer. I don't believe we've met...
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: It appears Sir Pouncelot has taken quite the liking to you.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Albedo! It's been such a long time! It's super great to see you! But... are you sure you're in the right place?
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 rosaria 02.ogg Rosaria: I'm assuming the Captain of the Investigation Team is here for some important reason?
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 valerina 02.ogg Valerina: C—Captain? He's a captain of the Knights of Favonius? An important officer just showed up without warning... and I don't even have any refreshments or snacks to offer!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 valerina 03.ogg Valerina: Please, allow me to explain, Sir. I assure you this shelter is operating under a legitimate business license! All proper procedures have been followed...
Assuming that Albedo has arrived to investigate her business, Valerina frantically searches for the relevant documents while explaining the purpose of the shelter... Valerina appears intimidated by the identity of the visitor, unaware that the Investigation Team doesn't handle such inspections...
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: There's no need to worry. I was simply in the area helping my team address a small issue... Namely, the location of this cat right here.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: Not too long ago, "Interim Team Feline: Treatment Case No. 3 — Sir Pouncelot" knocked out the weapons officer who was watching over him. He then fled and disappeared into the city.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: We knew we had to recover him as fast as possible. The cat belongs to the Investigation Team, and even bears the insignia of the Knights of Favonius. If he were to wreak havoc across the city... Well, that would hardly be a welcome result for any party involved.
Sir Pouncelot: *whimper*...
 So, he actually belongs to the Investigation Team?
 That would explain the Knights of Favonius symbol...
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: You're saying Sir Pouncelot is capable of knocking out a knight? And what's with all those official sounding titles you added to his name? Interim... Treatment case something or other... Is there something else you're not telling us?
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: Ah, well, I suppose I should explain. Two months ago, Sir Pouncelot got lost in the wild and accidentally ingested Whopperflower Nectar. Due to certain effects that are not entirely understood as of yet, the nectar caused him to triple in size.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Triple! Even regular-sized cats can get pretty bold when they're upset... A cat triple the size... Paimon bets even a Hilichurl wouldn't be enough to scare off a cat like that!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 rosaria 03.ogg Rosaria: So that's what happened. No wonder he was so anxious.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 rosaria 04.ogg Rosaria: For cats... or really any animal that lives in the wild, a larger size doesn't exactly confer many advantages. What it actually does is make their appearance more noticeable and their movements less nimble.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 rosaria 05.ogg Rosaria: Which, in turn, means living in perpetual danger of exposing themselves to attacks from predators. In other words, it means living in a constant state of fear...
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: Exactly. When Sir Pouncelot stumbled upon our encampment, he looked quite worse for wear. His entire body was riddled with scars and he appeared exceptionally anxious.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 valerina 04.ogg Valerina: Th—That's awful... I guess he had a good reason for all that swatting earlier, then... If all that had happened to me, I would be afraid of new people and strange animals too...
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: You don't need to worry too much. The problem has already been solved. I administered a restorative potion to eliminate the alchemical effects of the Whopperflower Nectar, and help him return to a normal size.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: Although he still might appear a bit larger than the average cat, his current size, at least, should pose no more threat to his quality of life. While in our care, various knights have been taking turns watching over him.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: In light of his feisty demeanor, Klee decided to call him "Sir Pouncelot." We all thought it was quite fitting. We even made him that little scarf as a testament to his time among our ranks.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Woah, Klee and Paimon were totally on the same wavelength with this one! We thought of the exact same name! Great minds really do think alike, hehe...
Sir Pouncelot: Meow~
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: Sir Pouncelot's extreme level of anxiety and caution around people may be a result of residual trauma from the time of his transformation. You could say he was less than friendly towards the weapons and signals officers on our team. Klee wasn't around that much to entertain him either.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 13.ogg Albedo: However, it appears Sir Pouncelot has taken quite the liking to you. The knights on my team would never have imagined that he could warm up to people like this.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 valerina 05.ogg Valerina: Well, they are our dear cat saviors, after all — The famed Honorary Knight and Paimon the Cat Whisperer!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 valerina 06a.ogg Valerina: No matter how feisty or frightening the cat, after a few minutes with (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) and Paimon, they'll be sweet as can be!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 14.ogg Albedo: If that's the case, then I have a question for you both. Would you be willing to adopt Sir Pouncelot?
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Wait, really? But, doesn't he belong to your team?
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 15.ogg Albedo: Well, we did take him in, but it was simply out of necessity. We were always planning to find him a permanent home after his condition became more stable.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 16.ogg Albedo: The Investigation Team is no place for a pet, and we are a combat unit, after all.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 17.ogg Albedo: Any knight he got close to would have to go on assignment eventually. It's hardly appropriate to just leave him at camp, and bringing him on our missions would only frighten him further.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 rosaria 06.ogg Rosaria: All good points.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 rosaria 07.ogg Rosaria: He's been through quite the ordeal already. For a creature like that, it's best to keep him away from potential triggers. That way, he can slowly recover in peace...
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Hmm, we could set up a nice, cozy little home for him in the Serenitea Pot. It has everything he could want! And most importantly... no monsters!
Sir Pouncelot: Meeoww!
 Great! Welcome to the family, Sir Pouncelot!
 Awesome! You've got a new home now, Sir Pouncelot!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Thank you so much, Albedo!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 18.ogg Albedo: No need to thank me! If you find yourselves with some time on your hands, maybe you can bring him by the encampment some time. I'm sure my fellow knights would love a chance to see his calmer side.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 valerina 07.ogg Valerina: Th—That was so touching! I can't believe I got to witness such a special moment! I do believe this counts as the Furball Fortress' first successful adoption!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 rosaria 08.ogg Rosaria: Hey, my veil is not a handkerchief...
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 19.ogg Albedo: It appears you enjoy interacting with small animals, Sister Rosaria. I must admit, I find that a bit surprising...
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Paimon can also sense that you're an animal lover, Rosaria! You definitely have a way with cats — you just haven't realized it yet. After all, it's not a side of you that comes out very often.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Snowball warmed up to you right from the start! And you were the one that helped Sir Pouncelot calm down back there!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 rosaria 09.ogg Rosaria: Oh, uh... I didn't really do anything though. I was just... there.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 valerina 08.ogg Valerina: Ah, I've got it! I've learned so many useful tips from our dear cat saviors recently!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 valerina 09.ogg Valerina: I've decided to extend the shelter's trial period for a bit in order to go over what I've learned. With some effort, I hope I can be a cat whisperer too one day. For now, though, I'll settle for cat whisperer... in training, hehe!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 valerina 10.ogg Valerina: When I open for good, what do you say we run the shelter together, Miss Rosaria? With the two of us, we could rescue every stray in Mondstadt!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Hmm, the sister and the whisperer working together... Almost sounds like it was meant to be, hehe!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 rosaria 10.ogg Rosaria: Oh, well... This errand hasn't proved to be too troublesome. It's light on work and stress. I suppose... I wouldn't be opposed to your suggestion.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 20.ogg Albedo: I don't know much about rescuing stray animals, but this seems to be quite the milestone. Allow me to offer my congratulations.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 albedo 21.ogg Albedo: If my fellow knights run into any strays, I'll be sure to tell them to send them your way.
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 valerina 11.ogg Valerina: Thank you, thank you, thank you! I really can't thank you all enough for your support! Don't worry, there's a generous reward in store for each and every one of you!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 valerina 12.ogg Valerina: The trial phase of the Furball Fortress could not have been more successful! When we open for good, you all simply must come to the opening ceremony. We'll cut the ribbon together!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Now that's what Paimon calls a successful commission! Rewarding in more ways than one — Mora, a sense of accomplishment, and, of course, our special friend, Sir Pouncelot! Talk about a win win win!
Media:vo mkeq003b 1 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Paimon can't wait for the Furball Fortress to open for good!
Sir Pouncelot: Meow!
