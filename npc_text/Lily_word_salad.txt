Dialogue[]

(Before completing Return to Days of Winter)
Lily: Daddy, what's Mommy doing?
Rudolf: Mommy is a sister, she believes in Barbatos, and she helps and guides all the other people who believe in Barbatos, too.
Lily: Daddy, who's Papa Toes? Is he a magic man?
Rudolf: Barbatos is the God of the Wind. He's a very magical man.
Rudolf: The reason why Mommy and Daddy and Lily have such a happy life is because Lord Barbatos is a very nice man and looks after us.
Lily: But Daddy, why is that man over there saying nasty things about Papa Toes?
Rudolf: Little boys and girls aren't allowed to listen to what the Fatui men say, alright dear?
(After completing Return to Days of Winter)
Lily: Dadda, will that man come back?
Rudolf: I don't think so.
Lily: Dadda... Is that Fatooey man really a very, very bad person?
Lily: He told me stowies, and he got me lots of food, too...
Lily: I don't think that's how bad people are...
Rudolf: Lily... Bad people and good people aren't that easy to tell apart.

Lily: Oh...
