Ideas, perspectives... What terribly boring avenues of inquiry! Pfft... Don't you go thinking that there are only ideas underneath my mask. I am certainly not bulletproof beneath it!—Katarina, Lost in a Foreign Land: Seeking
Katarina and her younger brother Nikolay were orphans raised in the Harbinger Arlecchino's House of the Hearth, where Katarina became close with fellow orphan Lyudochka Snezhevna.[1][2] After they grew older, all three became members of the Fatui, with both Katarina and Lyudochka being trained as Fatui Electro Cicin Mages.
Katarina and Nikolay were members of the Ninth Company when it was dispatched to The Chasm to investigate the mysterious forces that arose after the miners discovered the Wish Granter, a fragment of the Chasm Nail that had somehow split off from the main crystal. However, the Ninth Company faced disastrous blows while attempting to address the Abyssal corruption they discovered in The Chasm, which resulted in Nikolay's disappearance when he used himself as bait to draw away monsters from the rest of the squad. Refusing to abandon her brother, Katarina elected to stay in the depths of The Chasm even after her comrades escaped to the relative safety of higher grounds.[1][2]

Story[]
Katarina and Nikolay were orphans raised in the House of the Hearth as "children" of the Tsaritsa. There, Katarina grew close to Lyudochka, whom she calls "even dearer than a real sister." Katarina gifted Nikolay a balalaika which he greatly treasured, bringing it with him everywhere. After the three were trained as soldiers for the Fatui, Nikolay was assigned to the Ninth Company; Katarina was initially assigned to an unspecified regiment but was later transferred into the Ninth Company. Upon hearing the news, an overjoyed Nikolay wrote her a letter, a memento of his that she treasured dearly and kept on her person at all times.[2]

Present Day[]
Sometime after The Chasm's closure two years ago, and before the events of the Liyue Archon Quests, Signora made a deal with the Liyue Qixing which included a Fatui-Qixing collaboration to investigate the strange occurrences at The Chasm. The Ninth Company was dispatched to The Chasm under the impression that this operation was a mutually beneficial agreement free of any other conspiracies or objectives. Unfortunately, while that was true of their operation, the same could not be said for Tartaglia's mission (and Signora, who was using Tartaglia to complete her mission): To obtain Morax's Geo Gnosis by any means possible.[1]
Following Tartaglia's resurrection of Osial and the threat that the Fatui posed to Liyue Harbor, the Qixing nullified their prior agreements with the Fatui and cut off the Ninth Company's supply lines.[1][3] Meanwhile, the Ninth Company had met disastrous results in their investigation themselves. While they had ultimately discovered the Chasm Nail, the Mokosh Device they brought to purify the Abyssal corruption was overloaded and destroyed instead,[4] while nearly half their original 64 members were killed in action, including their Captain.[1] While searching for a path to the Chasm Nail, Katarina may have been the "Snezhevna" who rang one of the Ancient Bells in the Nameless Ruins, which caused the Abyss Lectors Egill and Agnarr to emerge from the dark fog and incur heavy casualties for the Ninth Company.[5]
In the chaos, Nikolay used himself as bait to lure their enemies away from the rest of the squad and disappeared. Refusing to abandon her brother, Katarina decided to stay in the depths of The Chasm, even as Anton and other survivors moved back to relative safety in higher ground. By this point, they realized that their supply chain had been cut, but had no way to find out what had occurred on the surface.[1][6]
Eventually, the Traveler discovered Katarina during their own investigation of The Chasm. Taking each other for enemies, the two attack each other, with the fight drawing to a close after the Traveler defeats her and she begs for them to stop. Due to the classified nature of the Fatui's operations, Katarina refuses to divulge much about their situation, when they attempt to interrogate her.[6] Eventually, however, she discloses that she had gotten lost in her search for Nikolay and asks them to search for him, or evidence of where he had disappeared to. The Traveler only found fragments of his diary and his bloodied insignia in the southern ruins at Stony Halls, and with the only path ahead blocked by fallen rocks, his survival was uncertain. Katarina thanked them for their findings and decided to go look for him.[2]
It is implied that Katarina encountered a Shadowy Husk on route to Nikolay's last known location provided by the Traveler, resulting in her leaving behind Nikolay's letter. Her fate remains unknown.[2]
