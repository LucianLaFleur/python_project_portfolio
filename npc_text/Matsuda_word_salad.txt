Appearance[]
Matsuda wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the ashigaru (Japanese: 足軽) of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient shitagi with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray kobakama, and waraji sandals without the socks. Although not visible, the Sangonomiya Clan's crest is imprinted on the back of the shitagi, below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with sode (shoulder armor), han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it. Matsuda is equipped with a juumonji yari, whose shaft is colored with a red-white gradient and has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest under the spearhead.

 Subject to inspection!

Dialogue[]

Matsuda: Halt! All passers-by must allow themselves to be inspected!
Matsuda: Where are you from? Where are you going? Answer me honestly!
 Do you really have to ask in so much detail?
Matsuda: Of course! This is my duty. I will see it through to the utmost of my ability!
Matsuda: Who knows what suspicious people might get into the camp if we aren't thorough...
 Has something similar happened before?
Matsuda: H—How would I... Um, ahem! I mean, of course not!
Matsuda: I've only been dispatched here recently, but I'm an dutiful soldier. For my comrades' safety, I won't let any spies in!
 See you around.
Matsuda: Eh? Don't just ignore me...
