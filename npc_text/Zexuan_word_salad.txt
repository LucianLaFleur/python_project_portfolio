Idle Quotes[]

 When will work resume...
Media:VO Zexuan 01.ogg "Just when will work resume?"

Dialogue[]

Zexuan: I wonder when work will be able to resume...
 Aren't you working right now?
Zexuan: Oh! I wasn't talk about myself. I was referring to the Golden House...
Zexuan: The Golden House's Mora production has already stopped for a long time. There are still mountains of Mora inside, but we no longer hear that crisp, clattering sound.
Zexuan: I applied for a transfer here just so I could hear the wonderful sound of raining money. Didn't think I'd be this unfortunate...
Zexuan: Eh? That's weird, you say? Well, even if that money isn't mine, I get a real rush from deep inside my soul whenever I listen to those clinking sounds... I mean, don't you?
 Um, goodbye.
Zexuan: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail. Be vigilant in all things.
