Profile[]
Big G was a childhood friend of Congzi, Little Wu, Mumu, and Meng. They used to live in what once was a village in Wuwang Hill, before Big G died in an unspecified accident. He was known by his friends for being acrophobic and having a terrible sense of direction, and he enjoyed extra-spicy Jueyun Chili Chicken.
The so-called curse that Luocheng feared so much, was no more than Big G's presence while following him to Liyue Harbor.

Appearance[]
Big G is the spirit of a young boy. He has gray hair and bangs with brown eyes and he wears a traditional Liyue outfit.
