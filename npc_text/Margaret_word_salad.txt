Margaret's location (Daytime)Additional context
Profile[]
Margaret is the owner of The Cat's Tail, which has recently seen a business boom after hiring Diona. Margaret's reason for hiring Diona was simple: she is cute, regardless of the fact that she is clearly not old enough to drink alcohol herself.
Despite being a bit simplistic at times, Margaret has a knack for writing witty promotional responses to the messages on the Cat's Tail Message Board, turning it into something of an advice board as people share their troubles on it. She also cottons on to the fact that Diluc left a message on her board, giving a sympathetic response to his wistfulness for the past and welcoming him to come to The Cat's Tail despite being her business rival.
She owns several cats, amongst others are Prince and Butterfly.

Appearance[]
Margaret has shoulder-length blonde hair. She wears a red and white dress and a brown hat. Her accessories consist of a red choker necklace, gold earrings, and a red bracelet on both of her hands.

Dialogue[]

(Before completing Master's Day Off)
Margaret: Finally, I have the chance to stop you. I've had my eye on you for a while now — an outlander wandering the plaza is quite easy to spot.
(After completing Master's Day Off)
Margaret: So, you couldn't resist stopping by again, huh?
Margaret: Hehe, that's alright. Thanks again for your help with my little Princey.
 About Stormterror...
(Unlocked after completing "A Long Shot")
Margaret: I must admit that though I'm glad we're all finally safe, I do feel just a bit unsatisfied.
Margaret: The Angel's Share was seriously affected by the dragon attacks as many of its popular drinks had their supplies cut.
Margaret: Here at Cat's Tail, we even had an ongoing discount to take further advantage...
Margaret: ...But in the end, our sales were still a little less than theirs.
Margaret: Still, there's not much I can do about that. It is supplied directly by the Dawn Winery, after all, which gives it an overwhelming advantage in terms of where they get their wine...
 What are you doing?
Margaret: I'm waiting for someone to invite me for a drink at the tavern. Would that be you?
Margaret: Just kidding! Loosen up a little! Mondstadt is a city of romance~!
 Well... ahh... Tell me about yourself.
Margaret: Me? I'm just a simple tavern owner.
Margaret: I'm sure you'd noticed my tavern, Cat's Tail, on your way here.
 Just how are the taverns around here?
Margaret: I don't like to admit it but the best tavern in the city is Angel's Share.
Margaret: However, ever since I hired Diona as my bartender, business has been looking up.
Margaret: Doesn't matter whether they came for the wine or for her... Money is flooding in now.
 Tell me, has there been anything happening as of recent?
Margaret: There have. Recently, the Angel's Share has been giving out complimentary Chicken-Mushroom Skewers, and we've been running a promotion response.
Margaret: Since we're the Cat's Tail, our main appetizer has to be Mondstadt Grilled Fish!
Margaret: Anyway, take these, and remember to swing by some time if you're free!
(Obtain  Mondstadt Grilled Fish ×4)
 Goodbye.
Margaret: Leaving already? Don't forget to come see me when you come to Cat's Tail for a night out.
Event Dialogue[]
Invitation of Windblume and Windblume's Breath[]
Margaret: Since it's the Windblume Festival, would you like to come to The Cat's Tail and have a few drinks?
Margaret: I might even give you some flowers... Hehe.
 About the Windblume Festival...
Margaret: The Windblume Festival had a very solemn meaning once...
Margaret: But nowadays, many people believe that it's just a time when they send flowers to others and get their feelings across.
Margaret: Oh? Have someone you'd like to send flowers to, do you? Let me guess... is it me, by any chance?
Margaret: ...Haha, don't be so nervous. I was just joking.
 What are you doing?
(Dialogue options and responses are the same as normal)
 Thanks, no need.../ No, thanks...
Margaret: Aww, don't be shy.

Of Ballads and Brews[]

Margaret: *sigh* It's Weinlesefest, but Diona is nowhere to be found.
Margaret: After all, she is especially upset when it comes to times like this. In order to ensure that she's still with us, we decided to let her take a couple days off.
Margaret: So... would you like to buy me a special Weinlesefest drink?
