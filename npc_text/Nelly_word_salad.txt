 Noise pollution...
Media:VO Nelly 01.ogg "There's some serious noise pollution going on in the production zone."

Dialogue[]

Nelly: Look, I've caught a major story!
 What are you doing here?
Nelly: I'm fishing for... *ahem* I mean, I'm looking for something I can write a news report about!
Nelly: Ah, you were thinking of jokes about the stereotypes about reporters just now, weren't you?
 I did think of a few, yes.
Nelly: And you're right to do so! I figured that if I wanted to be a reporter I needed to act like one. So I started to imitate all the stereotypes people have about reporters.
Nelly: Since I reminded you of one, that means I'm doing a good job. Heh.
 I thought you were fishing for "fish."
Nelly: I feel like you're trying to imply something... But you're right! I really want the Platinum Collection and I don't care what anyone else says.
 About the production zone...
Nelly: It's a production zone, so it's noisy, of course. There are the machines, the clockwork meka... and the loudspeaker!
Nelly: You know, I could probably turn the loudspeaker into a decent news story... yeah, that's a great idea!
 See you.
Nelly: See you. And I hope you catch the fish you want!
