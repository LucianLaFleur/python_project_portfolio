Personality[]
The Otogi King was raucous, boisterous, and liked to tell tales about his alleged fights with monsters (bake-kitsune, bake-danuki, evil demons, and Reizenbou being a few cited examples). He is apparently good with children; he kicked down Lavender Melon trees when he saw they were unable to reach the fruit, and took some of them to crash an official autumn leaf-watching concert.[1]

Appearance[]
During battle, the Otogi King would garb himself in golden brocade threaded with autumn grass and clouds, and he painted his face with the garish oil. He wore an haori with a golden flower during the wrestling match with Mikoshi Chiyo.[3]

Story[]
The Otogi King acted as a meditator between Urakusai and the Bake-Danuki, thus he received the sword Misugiri from the Kitsune.[3] He may also had a good relationship with the bake-danuki, as one anecdote of him was about him and Ioroi sealed the Four Oni of Ogata together.[4]
He lead the children to crash an official autumn leaf-watching concert, and earned a beating from the oni Chiyo in a wrestling match.[1] After the match, a seamstress from a commoner family helped him to patch and mend the golden flower that had come loose from his haori. He gifted her the Misugiri after insisting it was a reward and it was better than her small scissors.[3]
As the cataclysm arrived, the Otogi King made a promise with the children he would "cut off the horns of those monsters and bring them back for ya", claiming that it would "show you the might of the Otogi Kongou Lion King" and that the "creatures from beyond the ocean" were "easy pickings".[1] As with many other figures in the cataclysm, the Otogi King never came back from fighting the Abyss.

Trivia[]
Despite his claims of being able to vanquish powerful monsters, he was "never given the right to wear the Shogun's colors".[1]
