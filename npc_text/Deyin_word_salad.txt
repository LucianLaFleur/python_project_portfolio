Before completing An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade

 The matters of lay folk...
Media:VO Deyin 01.ogg "If one only speaks of the matters of lay folk, t'would be better not to speak at all."

After completing An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade

 About the adepti...
Media:VO Deyin 02.ogg "Such auspicious rain that wets the land, I say the work of the adepti is at hand."

Dialogue[]

Deyin: There is a saying: "No matter how many things rise and fall in this world, a clear spring will always flow alone."
Deyin: Scholars should stay true to their hearts and tell elegant stories. If they only speak of mundane affairs, they might as well say nothing...
 You are...
Deyin: I lack such talent, for I only count as a jade artisan and half a poet. But in the past, I would also occasionally tell stories at the Yilong Wharf teahouse.
 A jadeworker?
Deyin: Hah! When I was young, I was one of the best jade artisans in Chenyu Vale.
Deyin: There's always an inextricable connection between beautiful jade and fascinating stories.
Deyin: As such, I would tell my neighbors stories I had heard while carving jade, which made me somewhat famous in the area.
Deyin: Nowadays, I occasionally give my disciple some of my jade works to sell on my behalf.
Deyin: If you go to Yilong Wharf, you can visit my disciple's store. Maybe you'll come away with jadeware piece that tickles your fancy.
 From before?
Deyin: Recently, a youth has been coming to the teahouse, telling of the most humdrum happenings in the streets, thinking to please the people.
Deyin: A joke about a Fontainian who made a fool of themselves while drinking tea here, a story about a Monstadter who was knocked out after drinking three bowls of a local spirit there...
Deyin: While it's true that outsiders don't understand our traditions and do many outlandish things, it's better to only discuss such things over a cup of tea or after meals.
Deyin: On the stage, it's better to speak of more elegant affairs.
 As long as tempers have cooled off, and everyone's feeling happier.
Deyin: I'm not angry at all. I just feel like it's a shame.
Deyin: Yilong Wharf's a real riot compared to Qiaoying Village, so I get why travelers restlessly spoil for some fun while passing through.
Deyin: However, at the end of the day, Chenyu Vale has Adeptus Fujin and our thousands of ancestors who endured great hardships to lay foundations down for us, so that there might be endless stories worth telling.
Deyin: As such, a mixture of mundane matters and elegant tales of the past should be told on stage.
Deyin: I wonder when that youth will understand...
 See you.
Deyin: See you, then.
