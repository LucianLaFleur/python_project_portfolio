Klingsor is a member of the Abyss Order and one of the main antagonists of the World Quest Series Khvarena of Good and Evil. Sometime before the series begins, he convinced Nasejuna that the Order of Skeptics' origin story was a lie, which led Nasejuna to collaborate with him in their attempt to seize the five Great Songs of Khvarena.
Several hundred years ago, Klingsor was a member of the Order of Skeptics himself. He became enthralled by the power of the Abyss and transformed into an Abyss Herald, but failed in his initial attempt to bring the power of the Abyss to Teyvat thanks to Zurvan's efforts.

Profile[]
Klingsor was a member of the Order of Skeptics who descended from Hadura, a Khaenri'ahn and a member of the Schwanenritter. Resentful of Khaenri'ahns' poor reputation following the cataclysm, he began harboring doubts about the Order of Skeptics' teachings, particularly in regards to their origins.[1]
He had an opportunity to investigate his doubts when a group of Sumeru Akademiya scholars came to research such ruins despite the Skeptics' attempts to dissuade them; the then-Vijnanapati ordered Klingsor to monitor them and prevent them from going too far in their research, only for Klingsor to find material which he believed confirmed his suspicions. Embracing the power of the Abyss, he became an Abyss Herald and turned his back on the Skeptics, endeavoring to bring "truth" to Teyvat.

Story[]
History[]
Hundreds of years ago, Klingsor was a ranger in the Order of Skeptics. He was a descendant of Hadura, a member of the Schwanenritter during the cataclysm,[2] and appears to have held his Khaenri'ahn lineage in great esteem. Because Khaenri'ahns had a poor reputation due to their involvement in the cataclysm, even though some fought against the Abyss themselves, Klingsor came to suspect that the Order of Skeptics' founder Nagarjuna had hidden something.[1]
When an investigation team from Sumeru Akademiya came to the Girdle of the Sands to investigate Khaenri'ahn ruins, the Vijnanapati at the time dispatched Klingsor to supervise them. While Klingsor originally stuck to his assigned duty, the scholars noticed his interest in the historical records and convinced him to relax his guard.[3] At some point, Klingsor stumbled upon Rene's Investigation Notes and kept it.[1] As they made their way into the ruins, some team members heard a "kind of sound coming from under the ground" and wished to turn back, though the team leader chose to press on;[4] meanwhile, Klingsor began hearing a "gospel" buzzing in his ears. He eventually came upon the power of the Abyss and was enthralled by it, after which he "embraced the defilement's blessings" and became an Abyss Herald.[5] Meanwhile, the investigation team had lost many members to the defense mechanisms inside a previous set of ruins when they were set upon by Abyssal monsters, after which the remaining members "vanish[ed]" and were most likely killed. Klingsor disappeared when the monsters began appearing, causing the author of the Akademiya Investigation Team's Logs to suspect he may have betrayed them.[6]
By the time Klingsor reappeared in the Girdle of the Sands, he had already become an Abyss Herald while the investigation team was "nowhere to be found." He led the Abyss Order and Abyssal monsters in attacking the Vourukasha Oasis to obtain the Great Songs of Khvarena,[7] which they would use to reverse the Rite of Chinvat and break the seal over the Abyss at the Tunigi Hollow.[8] However, the Pari and the Skeptics repelled them, and Zurvan sealed the Oasis and many ruins using the Great Songs. However, the Skeptics' archives were destroyed during the conflict, leading them to lose much knowledge of their history.[7]

Present[]
Klingsor, who still sought to bring the power of the Abyss to Teyvat, kept his eyes on the Skeptics. He found an opportunity with the current Vijnanapati, Nasejuna, who harbored doubts regarding the Skeptics' origins, and showed Nasejuna the documents he had previously found; this proved enough to convince Nasejuna to side with the Abyss Order.[8] To complete the task which Klingsor had failed to do hundreds of years ago, Klingsor and Nasejuna conspired to obtain the Great Songs by tricking the Pari Sorush into gathering them, convincing her that she needed to sacrifice herself to quell the Sign of Apaosh that had appeared over the Harvisptokhm.
At the start of Khvarena of Good and Evil, the Traveler and Paimon accept a commission from the Adventurers' Guild regarding the Sign of Apaosha after discovering the Cryo Korybantes and end up becoming acquainted with Sorush. They obtain the Great Songs with Nasejuna's help, but harbor suspicions about his true intent. Their doubts prove to be right when Nasejuna attempts to seize the songs by force, calling upon Klingsor's aid. The Traveler defeats them, however, and Nasejuna makes a tactical retreat while Klingsor's fate is left unspecified.[8]
