Uesugi wears a standard uniform modeled from the ashigaru (Japanese: 足軽) of feudal Japan. He wears a purple-gray shitagi, gray kobakama, white socks, and waraji sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with gray accents consists of dou (breastplate) with the Inazuma Shogunate's crest, han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves). He is equipped with a juumonji yari (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead.

Dialogue[]

Uesugi: Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!
Uesugi: Traveler, what can I help you with?
 Who might you be?
Uesugi: I'm Doushin Uesugi of the Police Station. I'm a new recruit who just joined recently. Nice to meet you.
Uesugi: The Police Station's task is to maintain law and order in Inazuma. Our job is to handle the neighbors' reports.
Uesugi: However, these reports are mostly just little troubles that people run into during their daily life. There are also some amazingly clumsy mistakes...
Uesugi: Though I don't mind helping them take care of their problems, I still wish that I could handle some big cases so that my skills can finally be put to good use...
Uesugi: Otherwise, I'm going to end up like Owada — insignificant until my retirement. Honestly, I don't want to become like him at all.
 Isn't it good to have peace, though?
Uesugi: Ah, I didn't mean that... Of course I wish the residents peace. But something is bound to happen, isn't it?
Uesugi: I sometimes see the retainers of the Kamisato Clan going out for missions. And Ryuuji from the detective agency is often busy with cases. I always find it unsettling seeing how casual things can get at the Police Station.
Uesugi: As a Doushin of the Police Station, trying my best to take care of everyone's issues should be my job, right?
Uesugi: As such, I sometimes also work with Ryuuji to handle some cases. That sense of accomplishment when we finish a case is something that you don't get from working at the Police Station, hehe.
 Clumsy mistakes?
Uesugi: Well, it's all thanks to that Arataki Itto.
Uesugi: While the Vision Hunt Decree was in effect, he was defeated by Madam Kujou Sara. He has been conjuring up a plan to take his revenge since then.
Uesugi: Madam Kujou Sara saw he was very serious about the revenge, and that his fighting spirit was commendable. So they picked a day for another duel.
Uesugi: ...Somehow, Arataki Itto insisted that, due to some weird Oni rules, the rematch must be a sumo showdown at the crossroads...
Uesugi: That's just too weird! I mean, it's basically harassment against Madam Sara, right?
Uesugi: Anyway, the duel didn't happen in the end. Arataki was dragged away by some masked lady... I just hope that Madam Sara won't be affected by this..."
 Have you ever seen someone who looks like me?
Uesugi: A missing family member case, huh... I see, please elaborate further.
Uesugi: Yeah... yeah... I have jotted it down. Leave it to me. If I find anything related, I will contact you at the first opportunity I get.
 Goodbye.
Uesugi: Goodbye. Remember to report to me if you see anything suspicious.
