Razor's parents were members of the Adventurers' Guild and settled on the name "Razor" for their son because it sounded like an "adventurer's name."[1] They disappeared from Razor's life before Razor could have any recollection of them, and their son was raised by Boreas and his wolf pack in Wolvendom instead. At some point, Razor's parents entrusted Varka, Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, with a box of items which they hoped to pass down to their son. While Varka made contact with Razor at some point in the past and taught him how to wield a claymore, and later sent Lisa to teach him how to harness the power of his Electro Vision, Varka chose not to tell Razor about the box until the Weinlesefest during the event Of Ballads and Brews.[2]
