Dialogue[]

Neriman: Hello. Would you like to chat?
 And you are...
Neriman: I'm a local porter and I'm taking a break from my job.
Neriman: I was raised in the port. I'm the guy to talk to if you want to find out what's new around here.
 Around here...
Neriman: The long-term residents of Port Ormos are mostly traders and laborers who grew up around here.
Neriman: A lot of visitors and traders come here, but they tend to stick around only long enough to finish their business.
Neriman: For lodging, go to the hotel on the highland by the sea. Make sure to take the lift and spare yourself the long climb up.
Neriman: Who else is there... ah, right, the civil workers and Eremite mercs sent by the Akademiya.
Neriman: I'm not familiar with them, and people usually don't bother them. We'd rather spend time drinking in Djafar Tavern!
 What's new...
Neriman: Well, to be honest, there's really been nothing much recently. It's good that everyone's living in peace and quiet, right?
Neriman: If I have to name something I haven't seen before, it's probably those strange people I saw when there was a sea monster warning a few days ago.
Neriman: Everyone was closing up, then some members of the Eremites pulling a ragged researcher along with them made a fuss about going out to sea.
Neriman: I've seen people avoiding sea monsters, but I've never seen people running to them. From what I heard, it seemed they were studying marine life or something.
Neriman: Ah, I don't know if they made it back alive. If it was just to make a living, there was no need to put their own lives on the line like that...
 See you.
Neriman: Farewell. I've got to take a breather.
