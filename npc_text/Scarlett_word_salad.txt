In A Riddle Amidst the Crowds, Scarlett approaches Traveler and Paimon eating in Good Hunter. She introduces herself as "a traveler, visiting Mondstadt from another land," who supposedly had family and friends in Mondstadt. She shows interest in solving that year's Windblume prophecy, and attracts suspicion from Rosaria, who decides to spy on her. In Joy Above the Clouds it is revealed that she is a successor of a Hexenzirkel member I. Ivanovna N., who used the initial "J".
