Samail was a member of the Eremites who used to live in the desert. Like Jebrael, he was originally part of the Tanit tribe.[1]
Both Samail and Jebrael were part of an expedition team sent by Babel to explore the ruins of Gurabad.[1][2] Babel's true plan included eliminating adherents of King Deshret,[3] so she also sent a mole within the expedition team, Tarafa, to assassinate the entire team. Jebrael faked his own death and strucked down Tarafa before he could target Samail, thus only Samail and Jebrael were the only survivors. Those two left the Tanit tribes afterward, which irritated Babel, and she considered Jebrael (and possibly Samail) traitor.[1]
Samail and Jebrael joined, or founded, an Eremite faction call Thutmose, and they were called "the Twin Blades of Thutmose." They were interested in the lost powers of King Deshret and forced researchers to help them find the King's throne. It's implied that a part of the reason Samail sought this power was for his revenge on Babel.[4] Jebrael eventually had a daughter (Jeht) with one researcher, Ufairah. Following Jeht's birth, Jebrael began to regret his past actions and sought to leave Thutmose with his family. Unfortunately, this led to Samail murdering Ufairah, as he felt Ufairah's love for Jebrael was an "infection" who had made him "weak".[5] Ultimately, Jebrael still left Thutmose.
Samail and Jebrael would not meet again until the events of the Golden Slumber quest series. After activating a mechanism in King Deshret's Mausoleum, Samail and the Fatui ran into Benben, a strange Primal Construct and captured it. After a short but heated conversation, Samail and the Fatui attacked but were driven off. Samail then sent his Eremites to attack the merchants at the oasis, although Jebrael's wariness allowed them to escape relatively unharmed until rescue arrived.
Samail and his lackeys then laid low until Jebrael and his group solved the puzzles of King Deshret, allowing Khaj-Nisut to rise and the throne to appear, having captured Jeht. To get everyone to safety, Jebrael duped Samail into sitting in the throne and singing the prayer of the Golden Slumber, causing his soul to be sent there. However, upon defeating his lackeys, who believed him killed, Samail revealed himself to have overtaken the Golden Slumber's consciousness and attempted to drag the group inside with him, sealing off the temple's exit. With no choice, Jebrael went into the slumber to confront Samail, allowing the others to escape.
