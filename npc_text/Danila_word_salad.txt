Profile[]
Danila is a soldier of the Ninth Company, sent to The Chasm to fight the darkness underneath, bringing a device along with them. The device brought in by the company failed and the group scattered. Danila remained with Anton alongside fellow soldiers Radomir and Temur. Danila was upset at the course of action taken by his fellow soldiers with their arguing after running out of food, especially questioning Anton's leadership skills.
After learning they were no longer welcome in Liyue, Danila wondered who would protect Liyue from the darkness, as their captain told them that their mission did not involve any conspiracies or schemes. However, Anton insisted on retreating from the Chasm as they were in no shape to fight. Danila thanked the Traveler for their help and wished them well on their journey before leaving with his fellow soldiers.

Appearance[]
