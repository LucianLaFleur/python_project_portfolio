Profile[]
Date is a character mentioned by Ema.[1] She states that he was the son of a man named Eurydates, and was from a wealthy and distinguished clan of Byakuyakoku. Based on what book he borrowed and why he borrowed it, it can be inferred that he is something of an inventor. Ema is cross with him because the book he borrowed, Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku, is overdue.

(Talk to Date again after completing Date's Challenge)
Date: Honestly, these labyrinths are just a means, not the end. What I really wish to do is serve the people, like Aberaku did.
