Story[]
Because the Wanderer's Troupe took in people from all over Teyvat, her origins remain a mystery. The Dawnlight Swordswoman first met with the Conductor and the Sojourner, and later Kreuzlied, with whom she formed the Wanderer's Troupe.[2]
As a group they both performed music and fought against the oppressive Aristocracy. As part of the Troupe, the Dawnlight Swordswoman wielded The Flute sword. Their final act was to storm the City of Mondstadt in an attempt to overthrow the Aristocracy. They failed, however, and the Dawnlight was enslaved as a gladiator.[3]
Despite losing all her hope and her friends, she continued to sing of freedom. Her words strengthened Ragnvindr's resolve to fight against the aristocracy. She eventually died in the arena, which Ragnvindr witnessed. After her death, he buried her with her sword and adopted the title of "Dawn Knight" for himself after her own "Dawnlight."[1][4]
