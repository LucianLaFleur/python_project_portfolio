Profile[]
Jak is the "Orchestre" of the team due to Jak seeing himself and the rest of the team as an orchestra of resistance against Narcissus. Jak is the most politically opinionated of the Narzissenkreuz Adventure Team. Jak would often voice his opinions during the quest which would end up getting the rest of the team in a heated argument. Most of Jak's beliefs revolve around hierarchies and its unjust and oppressive nature, calling out the monarchial and feudal system. It has even got to the point where Jak refers Princess Lyris as "Ms. Lyris" and correcting Ann calling the Narzissenkreuz as a republic instead of a kingdom. Nevertheless, he's still able to cooperate with the rest of the team when it comes to saving Princess Lyris.
