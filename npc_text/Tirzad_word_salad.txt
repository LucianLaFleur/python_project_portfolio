Profile[]
Tirzad is a Vahumana researcher who went into the Great Red Sand to research and explore King Deshret's civilization. He hired Bonifaz's merchant group, taking Nachtigal, Mirsad and Omid alongside Jebrael and Jeht. However, they fell into a sinkhole and were unable to get out. The Traveler was then tasked with Bonifaz to find the group, where they decided to look for a way out underground after seeing they could not climb their way out.
The group was able to find a way out and continued on with Tirzad's research, although he frequently clashed with Jebrael over the ideals and values of the Eremites. They soon ran into Samail, who had collaborated with the Fatui to find the Golden Slumber. While Tirzad wanted to be cautious and simply wait for Samail's interest to die off, Jebrael knew they didn't have a choice and they raised Khaj-Nisut from the sands to find King Deshret's throne. After defeating Samail's lackeys, Samail, using the consciousness of the Golden Slumber, tried to drag the group into the dream with him, but Jebrael sacrificed himself to save the others.
After returning to Aaru Village, Tirzad felt sorry for Jeht, thanking the Traveler for their efforts before returning to Sumeru City to submit his paper on the entire journey, which was considered a resounding success.
