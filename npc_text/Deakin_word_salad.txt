Profile[]
Deakin is a prisoner of the Fortress of Meropide. To get extra Credit Coupons, he volunteers his time as a guide for arriving newcomers. 
After arriving into the prison, the Traveler and Paimon were introduced to the system by Deakin after having their papers registered, where he was somewhat hostile towards them, believing them to be nothing special. However, he became surprised and shocked when they were greeted by Wriothesley, who asked the Traveler what they thought of his work ethic. If the Traveler chose to feign approval, Wriothesley had the guards give him extra coupons to his delight, while if they said the truth, he stated that he had just missed a chance for promotion, causing him to admit that he was only interested in the coupons and expressed regret for his attitude.
The Traveler would later find Deakin in the Production Zone while investigating the prison, where he greeted them in a more friendly matter; if they had feigned approval, he also gave them his extra Credit Coupons, stating that he did not deserve them.
