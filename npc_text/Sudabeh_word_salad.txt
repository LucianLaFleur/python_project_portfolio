 About Aranara...
Sudabeh: Sorry, I can't tell you... But I have my reasons...
 About the story of two distinguished ladies...

 I'm sure Sudabeh will grow up to be a great distinguished lady!

Sudabeh: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), have a taste of the curry I made! My father and brother all thought it was good after they tried it!
