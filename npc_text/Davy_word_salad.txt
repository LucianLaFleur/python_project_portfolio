 Out in the wild...
Media:VO Davy 01.ogg "Ah... Everything is so fresh and clear out in the wild!"

Dialogue[]

Davy: Ah, everything is so fresh and clear out in the wild. I'm so much more inspired here...
Davy: My work will be far greater than the nonsense that woman comes out with!
 Is there anything of note nearby?
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Davy knows; Version 1)

Davy: Anything of note? Hmm...
Davy: While I was wandering around looking for inspiration, I noticed something shiny out of the corner of my eye. To me, it looked like Crystal Ore...
Davy: But a rare type — at least, I haven't seen any of that quality before. The rough location was...
Davy: ...There. I've marked it on your map. Perhaps you might have some use for it?

Davy: Anything of note? Hmm...
Davy: While I was wandering around looking for inspiration, I noticed something shiny out of the corner of my eye. Some sort of Crystal Ore, perhaps?
Davy: The rough location was...
Davy: ...There. I've marked it on your map. Perhaps you might have some use for it?
(Rich Ore Reserves nearby marked on the map)
(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Davy knows)

Davy: Hmm, nothing especially noteworthy for a traveler, I'd say. Not recently, anyway. ... Except for my singing, of course.
 Which woman?
Davy: You'll probably run into her if you go to Springvale... She's my ex-wife, Myweiss. A bard, just like me.
Davy: I'm convinced the only reason I ever looked her way is because I bashed my head when Stormterror attacked!
Davy: Can you believe they used to call us Mr. and Mrs. Lovebard? It's so nauseating now that I think back on it.
Davy: But the worst thing of all is her original compositions...
 Tell me about her work.
Davy: Well. After the divorce, she started using her compositions as a way of stirring up controversy... Pfft. I, for one, do not consider anything she writes to be true poetry.
Davy: She will do whatever it takes to smear my name... and that's when she was the irresponsible one who never contributed to the home!
Davy: For example, we had a clear agreement that we would take it in turns to do the cooking and the housework. But every time I got back from a performance, she was never there. So I ended up cooking all the meals and doing all the housework myself!
Davy: At least I understand now — love is a big old hoax!
 Goodbye.
Davy: Goodbye! Come and listen to my new ballad when it's ready — it's called the Manacles of Matrimony.
