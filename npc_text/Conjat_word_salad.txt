 Does anyone visit?
Media:VO Conjat 01.ogg "Does anyone ever actually visit this place?"

Dialogue[]

Conjat: Will anyone really come visit this place...
 Is there anything of note nearby?
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Conjat knows; Version 1)

Conjat: Well, since you're asking... If you don't mind me being blunt, are you looking for ore?
Conjat: Someone mistook me for a researcher earlier and directed me toward a place full of Condessence Crystals.
Conjat: No one really comes around here, but I can't exactly leave, either... So if you need to, you can check it out. It's just nearby, after all.

Conjat: Well, since you're asking... If you don't mind me being blunt, are you looking for ore?
Conjat: Someone mistook me for a researcher earlier and directed me towards a place full of Condessence Crystals. There's even Magical Crystal Ore to be had there.
Conjat: No one really comes around here, but I can't exactly leave, either... So if you need to, you can check it out. It's just nearby, after all.

(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Conjat knows)

Conjat: Would you like to visit that floating Central Laboratory? If not... Then there's not a lot I have for you.
 About visitors...
Conjat: Hello, Honorary Senior Researcher. You mean, "What is there to even visit here"?
Conjat: Well, if we want to get specific about potential attractions... I guess it would be the airborne Central Laboratory.
Conjat: According to Messieurs Raimondo and Choiseul, the institute will convert that laboratory into a Safety Exhibition.
Conjat: Inside, there will be pictures from all the Institute's old research projects...
Conjat: Though... I don't see what those projects have to do with a Safety Exhibition...
Conjat: And would anyone want to visit such an exhibition...
 Is there anything else to visit around here?
Conjat: Monsieur Choiseul said the Academic Assembly Hall is going to be renovated and reopened to host regular exhibitions of the products Institute research.
Conjat: But all we have to show at the moment would be clockwork puppets like the Artificed Dancers...
Conjat: If nothing else, we can rebuild Mary-Ann Memorial Park. At least the scenery there is pretty nice...
 See you.
Conjat: Goodbye. I'd better get on with my work...
