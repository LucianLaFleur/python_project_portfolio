 I wonder...

Dialogue[]

Gracie: Whether you wish to go to the opera house or the Fountain of Lucine, please head southward along this road.
 Tell me about the opera house...
Gracie: The most magnificent building on Erinnyes is the Opera Epiclese. When we Fontainians speak of the "opera house," that's what we're normally referring to.
Gracie: It has another, more important role, besides serving as a site for various cultural performances.
Gracie: It is also a courtroom in which all cases in Fontaine are judged.
 Tell me about the Fountain of Lucine...
Gracie: That is where all the waters in our land gather, and so it is the most popular site for wishes.
Gracie: Couples who wish for children go there, believing that the spirits in the water will bless them with healthy and happy children.
 Thank you.
Gracie: You're welcome.
