Clementine is the wife of the former president of Spina di Rosula, Callas. She also served as a mediator in the organization, handling disputes between members. There was once a major internal dispute in Spina di Rosula in which Clementine sided with Callas, who wished to invest funds in the construction of Fontaine's aquabus lines, while Romeuf and his faction wanted to improve Poisson. Because she had sided with Callas and was pregnant with his child, however, Romeuf's faction felt she had betrayed her role as a mediator and left Spina di Rosula.[1]
Since Spina di Rosula ultimately ended up sponsoring the construction of the aquabus lines, the Clementine line is named after her.[1]
Clementine passed away before the events of the game due to complications during the birth of her daughter, Navia — a secret Callas had chose to keep from Navia, which frustrated Navia once she found out.

People say we have similar personalities, and I can kind of understand her reasons for making the decisions she did back in the day, but even so...Huh, I have a sudden urge to take a trip on the Clementine Line. Could you come with me? I don't have a particular goal in mind, but... maybe we could take a walk around the city afterwards?
