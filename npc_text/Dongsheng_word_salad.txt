Dialogue[]

Dongsheng: Welcome, welcome to the Second Life. What would you like to buy?
 This and that.
Dongsheng: Over here please. Pick at your leisure.
(Opens Second Life wares)
 What's this place?
Dongsheng: We're just a small store that sells everyday goods. The name's a little special, I know. I wanted to... commemorate something that happened in the past.
Dongsheng: Would you care to hear how this store got its name?
 Well, let's hear it.
Dongsheng: I used to be an adventurer who visited every corner of the world.
Dongsheng: But the good times couldn't last. I got into an accident in Dihua Marsh, and was seriously injured.
Dongsheng: Fortunately, a masked adeptus came to my rescue, and I was barely able to escape with my life.
Dongsheng: From that day on, I never ventured out again. This life was given to me by that adeptus. I can't just throw it away that easily.
Dongsheng: An ancient adage of Liyue says that "a withered tree lives again," referring to life being given anew — which fits my experience exactly.
Dongsheng: That's why I adapted the last part of that saying and made it the name of my shop, to commemorate that event.
 I'm sorry, but I have matters to attend to.
Dongsheng: It's alright, it's best not to raise old matters.
Dongsheng: A simple life is best, after all...
 No, thanks. See you.
Dongsheng: Alright. Do come again, dear guest.
