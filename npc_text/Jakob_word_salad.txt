Jakob Ingold, born Jakob Baker,[3] is a Fontainian figure who was born over 500 years ago and remained alive in the present day as a "neohuman" who has successfully adjusted to the Abyss' power. Jakob and his adoptive older brother, Rene de Petrichor, are the founders of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, a radical organization which has turned to using the Abyss' power to overcome or transcend the predicted flood which will destroy all of Teyvat.
Jakob has history with many of the other notable factions before and after the Cataclysm, such as Fleuve Cendre, the Narzissenkreuz Institute, and the Institute of Natural Philosophy. His research into the Waters of the Primordial Sea, and specifically its ability to dissolve Fontainians while incorporating their memories, became a plot point during the first two Acts of Fontaine's Archon Quest Chapter.

Profile[]
Jakob is closely related to many major Fontainian figures before and after the cataclysm 500 years ago, and is one of the main characters of Fontaine's post-cataclysm story. Jakob was the son of Fleuve Cendre vigilante Eduardo Baker, and was later raised in the Narzissenkreuz Institute alongside Rene de Petrichor, Alain, and Mary-Ann after the Siege of Poisson separated him from his father.
When the cataclysm struck, Jakob and Rene were sent to live with Karl Ingold,[4][5] who took them on an expedition to the Girdle of the Sands in Sumeru after the cataclysm ended. Jakob, who was born with a weak constitution, fell into a coma and Rene secretly used the power of the Abyss to save his life. He miraculously adapted to the Abyss' power,[6] becoming the first successful example of what Rene later dubbed a "neohuman." Believing Jakob's transformation held the key to preserving humanity in the wake of the end of the world as they had foreseen it, the two decided to gather data by joining the Institute of Natural Philosophy.
Although initially overjoyed over reuniting with Alain and Mary-Ann and being assigned to Alain's project, the two found that Alain did not trust anything he did not personally verify, souring their relationship with him.[7][8] This relationship further broke down following their disastrous attempt to save the life of Alain's assistant, Carter Scherbius, who was dying from illness. After this event, the two instead doubled down on expanding the influence of their secret society, the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, to continue towards their original goal of stopping the apocalypse. Their increasingly radical research led to Rene's near-death by dissolution and the severing of ties by Mary-Ann, who had up to that point still kept in touch with Jakob. In his desperation to save Rene, Jakob was the one who constructed the base form of the Master Narzissenkreuz.[9] The Ordo's further activities caught the attention of the Marechaussee Hunters, and the Court of Fontaine decided to shut the society down. A fateful battle broke out when — on Narzissenkreuz' orders — Jakob and several other Ordo members were sent to Elynas' remains and were confronted by Mary-Ann, her mechanical steward Seymour, and Alain. Mary-Ann went missing after the battle, while Seymour was critically damaged. Jakob survived and remains active in the present day.[10][11]
Documents from the post-cataclysm era, particularly Rene's, emphasize Jakob's youth and predisposition for crying — he frequently cried at the Narzissenkreuz Institute, in secret during the expedition in Sumeru, when Alain refused to believe their findings or help them, while killing Riftwolves using his newfound power, as a neohuman, and whenever he laid eyes on Carter following their failed experimentation. He also grew emotional at the prospect of having to fight Alain and Mary-Ann. However, Jakob also possessed a talent for designing ceremonies and rituals to sway the Ordo's followers,[12] and was willing to take larger risks for the sake of his goals. At one point, Rene briefly pondered if Jakob was not really himself anymore after being integrated with the Abyss, but never continued with that train of thought.[11] Regardless, Jakob remained loyal to Rene throughout their project. His leadership of the Ordo during Rene's near-death following a failed experiment hardened his personality: Jakob became used to deception, projecting confidence to outsiders, and became willing to do anything to succeed, including experimenting on his own followers.[9]
In the present day, he tricks Irus and her lackeys into working for him for free, easily gains Mamere's trust (although this is also due to her naivete regarding humans), and appears completely unapologetic about ransacking Mamere's house for Elynas' blood. His methods lead Paimon to compare him to the Abyss Order, although he quickly dissociates himself from them and calls them "benighted primitives" who are no different from "those oppressors" in trying to use a power that only a few can use.[10] Ann, who holds some of Mary-Ann's memories, attributes Jakob's change in personality to Rene's influence, adding that "Rene changed too."[13]
Jakob's transformation into a neohuman appears to have given him great strength, the ability to live without sustenance, and a greatly increased lifespan.

Appearance[]
In his present-day human form, Jakob has the appearance of a young man with pale skin; short, light brown hair; and green eyes. He wears a boater hat and a purple coat with a white jabot.
Jakob can freely undergo a "transformation" from a human form to that of an Iniquitous Baptist.[10][11]

Story[]
Early Life[]
Little is known about Jakob's life before the purge of Fleuve Cendre. His father, Eduardo Baker, was arrested for resisting the purge. He was being taken to exile in the desert when his henchmen rescued him and took the Maison Gardiennage escorting him hostage, before regrouping with their allies and occupying Poisson. This was likely how Jakob met and befriended Rene de Petrichor, the son of then-mayor of Poisson Renault de Petrichor, as Jakob was depicted clinging to Rene's hand in a group photo at Poisson taken by Karl Ingold.[3] Karl, who was a journalist at the time, was acting as a mediator between Eduardo's faction and the Court of Fontaine. Despite his best efforts, negotiations broke down.[14] In an event that came to be known as the Siege of Poisson, the Marechaussee Hunters, led by Emanuel Guillotin, engaged in a large-scale conflict which razed Poisson, killing many and disfiguring Emanuel himself. Rene's parents were likely killed during the Siege,[15] Rene and Jakob were taken by the Hunters to the Narzissenkreuz Institute, which raised orphans and the children of criminals.[16]
Within the Narzissenkreuz Institute, Jakob and Rene became close friends with Alain and Mary-Ann. They enjoyed playing role-playing games, with Jakob taking on the role of the wicked mage. They often admired the Green Feather Accessory attached to Vice Director Basil Elton's hat, believing that it had a storied history and that Basil had many stories of her own. Despite Director Lyris' promise to obtain that feather for them, she never succeeded.[17]
Several years after the Siege of Poisson, Basil invited her old friends from her own childhood at the Narzissenkreuz Institute — Karl Ingold, Emanuel Guillotin, and Dwight Lasker — back for a reunion. Karl took a group photo of the current Institute members, including Jakob and Rene, causing him to reminisce on the events leading up to the Siege.[14]

Cataclysm[]
During the cataclysm, the Oceanids of Fontaine including Lyris left to "defeat the evil at its source,"[18] presumably meaning Khaenri'ah. Meanwhile, Basil was summoned back to lead the reinstated Fontaine Armada to confront the great beast Elynas, which had invaded Fontaine. Before departing, Basil entrusted Jakob with the Green Feather Accessory for safekeeping, claiming that she and the Director would return shortly.[17] In case of her death, having foreseen that the Institute would be submerged in water, Basil arranged for Karl to take in Jakob and Rene, while Alain and Mary-Ann would go with Emanuel.[4]
Basil ultimately perished after a long pursuit, but successfully took down Elynas in the process.[19] Meanwhile, a massive flood later called the "first diluvian period" (or "first flood period") submerged much of Fontaine, including the Narzissenkreuz Institute. As promised, the children went to their new adoptive fathers. Years later, Jakob continued to view Basil's death as a form of "abandonment,"[20] having realized that she had given them empty promises about returning safely.[6]

Girdle of the Sands Expedition[]
Sometime after the cataclysm, Karl, Rene, and Jakob explored the ruins in Vourukasha Oasis and Madinat al-Nuhas, guided by the Order of Skeptics. At this time, Jakob had recently grown his third adult tooth. Early on, Rene noticed that a certain "sacred lotus" — the Gaokerena located inside the Harvisptokhm, which is actually the remains of the previous Hydro Archon, Egeria[21] — had a similar composition to their own bodies but not to Karl's.[6]
During the trip, Jakob's weak constitution caused his health to deteriorate. Rene, concerned that Jakob wouldn't survive the journey back to Fontaine for treatment, wished to use the power of the Abyss to save Jakob. Karl vehemently opposed this idea due to the havoc Abyssal power had wreaked during the cataclysm. Rene, however, went behind his back and used Abyssal power to save Jakob. One of the side effects of Jakob's recovery was that he no longer needed sustenance, which would immediately reveal them to Karl, so the two went to great lengths to keep Karl from growing suspicious.[6]
Using the data and records they had discovered in the Khaenri'ahn ruins, Rene and Jakob deduced Khaenri'ah's "world-formula" and used it to predict Fontaine's future, up to the end of an event which Rene dubbed the "second flood period"[6] (or the "second diluvian period"). Their calculations predicted the apocalypse. In a few hundred years, "all the birthing waters of the world" would dry up; hundreds of years after that, a flood during the second diluvian period would "cover the earth and sky"[22] and leave the world in ruins, with no plant life capable of surviving.[23] and no new civilizations created afterwards.[24][Note 1] However, Rene also found what he believed could be a way to "resist the impact" by extracting the "will" of an unknown entity, and the two returned to Fontaine with plans to avoid the predicted disaster.[6] To reassure Jakob, who had started crying out of fear after seeing the vision, Rene suggested that his special constitution would allow him to survive and that they would have to investigate the ancient Golden Troupe records for "new possibilities."[23]

Return to Fontaine[]
After returning to Fontaine, Rene and Jakob returned to the ruins of an ancient order and perused countless volumes, but could not change the results of their predictions no matter how many times they derived it. Rene speculated that introducing "variables" — the power of the Abyss — from outside the system could alter the outcome of the impending apocalypse. Sometime later, the two visited a ruin left behind by the Golden Troupe, located at the southwest side of Elynas, and found records of their magical techniques, including the "Seal of the Chymical Marriage."[24]
From this, Rene and Jakob began to take an interest in Elynas' remains. They infiltrated Elynas' body, where they sensed the presence of a certain "will," which was actually Elynas' consciousness becoming aware of their presence. Elynas' flesh possessed a wellspring of vitality but was also poisonous. Rene wanted to obtain safe experimental data first through the Institute of Natural Philosophy before setting specific research objectives, while Jakob thought it would waste precious time. While Rene hesitated about harnessing Elynas' power to strengthen Jakob, Jakob went off on his own and absorbed some of Elynas' blood. He appeared to suffer only minor adverse reactions, which encouraged them to continue their testing.[25]
While investigating Elynas' remains, Jakob and Rene coincidentally encountered Alain, Mary-Ann, and Emanuel Guillotin, who were gathering research of their own for Alain's project at the Institute of Natural Philosophy.[7] Although they were elated to see their old friends again, Rene was wary of Emanuel due to his involvement in the Siege of Poisson and did not reveal Jakob's secret to the Guillotin siblings.[25] Afterwards, Alain recommended Jakob and Rene to the Institute's director (who was likely Dwight Lasker).[7]
Rene continued testing Jakob's strength. By that point, Jakob no longer needed to eat to survive and only continued doing so out of habit. He had gotten used to supplementing his nutrition through Elynas' flesh and blood, and Rene believed that the previous "adverse reactions" were simply Jakob being disgusted and nauseous. Jakob was able to wipe out a group of Rifthounds that attacked him and Rene, although he was driven to the point of tears.[26]

Institute of Natural Philosophy[]
Following Alain's recommendation, Rene and Jakob were accepted into the Institute of Natural Philosophy and were temporarily assigned to work in Alain's laboratory, assisting in his research on Khaenri'ah war machines and Primal Constructs. During their time there, they also met Carter Scherbius, Alain's research assistant. Jakob grew close to Carter and viewed him as a brother,[12] though the latter felt ashamed for being an adult who needed reassurance from a child as young as Jakob.[27] Apart from their duties, Jakob enjoyed watching Alain take apart pocket watches and other clockwork devices, just as he did in his childhood days at the Narzissenkreuz Institute.[8]
Despite finding the intelligence of the Institute's members to be worse than he expected, Rene recognized that their influence in Fontainian society was necessary for spreading awareness of the predictions he and Jakob saw. Rene planned on using "that book," possibly referring to the Book of Revealing,[Note 2] to show others the visions they had seen.[8]
One day, Carter and Mary-Ann used the pretext of field research to bring themselves, Alain, Jakob, and Rene to the town of Petrichor for a day of outdoor play and picnic. During the trip, Rene discovered remnants related to the Golden Troupe, including golems from the civilization Remuria and a damaged map. Carter's condition relapsed after returning from the trip, leading Rene and Jakob to learn about his illness. During their visits to Carter, they learned that he was also a graduate of the Narzissenkreuz Institute from an earlier generation and bonded over their memories of the Institute.[27] Moved to try and find a cure for him, and already frustrated by Alain's refusal to trust anyone's research results besides his own, the two decided to leave Alain's project to conduct their own research.[8][20]
Jakob and Rene's application was approved and they were given their own laboratory to conduct research into the Abyss. Due to the dangerous nature of their research, their lab was locked off from those uninvolved in their research. Shortly after Alain's energy breakthrough, they obtained a red gemstone from Durin's remains and named it "Scarlet Quartz." Jakob helped to verify that the properties of these gemstones were very similar to Elynas' blood and flesh, as well as Dark Mud from Liyue. Their research stalled after that, much to Rene's frustration, but the two were able to keep expanding the size of their secret society, with the "tricks" which Rene instructed Jakob to perform proving to be particularly effective in converting people to their side. Rene decided to name this secret society the "Narzissenkreuz Ordo" to instill its members with a sense of purpose and belonging, and further reinforce their loyalty to the cause.[11]

Failed Experiment[]
Carter's condition continued deteriorating and Rene sent several samples to Sumeru, which had superior medical advancements to Fontaine's, but the root cause of Carter's illness was indeterminable. Jakob suggested they repeat the method used during the Girdle of the Sands expedition which had saved his life to save Carter, a dangerous process which involved harnessing the power of the Abyss. Jakob and Rene were candid with Carter about their intentions, and he eventually agreed to be a willing participant in the experiment.[11][20]
The procedure, however, ultimately failed, caused Carter's body to begin rapidly deteriorating. Although they eventually managed to stop any further tissue collapse, and Carter still remained preserved in a somewhat conscious-state, Alain completely severed ties with Rene and Jakob.[11] When Rene informed Jakob that Alain would no longer be helping them, Jakob broke down into tears. Changing their focus to expanding the Ordo, Rene came up with the idea of creating the Book of Revealing and devising various ceremonies to gather more members and reinforce their loyalty.[11][23][28] Jakob was responsible for many of these designs, and Rene was pleased with the "sense of mystery and ceremony" that Jakob created.[12]

Tower of Ipsissimus[]
During a discussion with Jakob, Rene thought of another direction worth trying in their efforts to save the world.[11] Rene and Jakob, accompanied by the members of the Ordo, returned to Petrichor and revisited the ruins of Remuria that they had previously associated with the Golden Troupe. During their exploration, they stumbled upon the origin of Fontainians — the humanoid Oceanids created by Egeria via the Primordial Sea. They also found that the ancient people managed to preserve their consciousness within stone golems to withstand the impending apocalypse, which was also related to the Primordial Sea.[29] This soon became a research subject for the Narzissenkreuz Ordo.[30] They also discovered that the "Seal of Chymical Marriage" was a spell used by the Remurian civilization to seal the Primordial Sea.[2]
Rene and Jakob ventured to the submerged Narzissenkreuz Institute and visited its former director, Lyris. Though she had survived the cataclysm and returned to Fontaine after uncovering Egeria's death, her condition had begun rapidly deteriorating, and she remained alone in the abandoned ruins of the former Narzissenkreuz Institute, longing for the past. Rene had initially planned to visit her in the future and even contemplated building a new home where he could bring her, which would also make Jakob happy. Jakob left behind the feather ornament given to him by the now-deceased vice director, which he had preserved for all that time.[28]
Sometime after the dissolution of the Institute of Natural Philosophy, the society later obtained clues regarding the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz and discovered its constituent elements, the "Circle of Four Orthants" and a "Tree of Emanation." According to the "Seal of Chymical Marriage," Rene discovered that the Primordial Sea would erupt from a suppressed breach, known as the Fortress of Meropide, acting as its "root." And the sea water would then flow to "the center of the circle," another suppressed breach of the Primordial Sea. Rene sent Ordo members to search for "traces of water and channels of higher quality and density" to determine the location of "the center of the circle" and "four constituent elements." Rene made the discovery that these secrets, which had been carefully guarded by ancient civilizations, were actually something they had experienced countless times during their youth in the Narzissenkreuz Institute. They also found the "slate replica," which supported their calculations.[31][32]
According to Rene's plan, after the Primordial Sea dissolves the Fontainians, he would receive the consciousnesses within the sea water at "the center of the circle," saving everyone from the apocalypse caused by the All-Devouring Narwhal.[2]
The society planned to construct the Tower of Ipsissimus on "the center of the circle" as their new stronghold. They also built the Orthant of Memory, Orthant of Wishes, Orthant of Souls, and Orthant of Persona at the locations of the "four constituent elements." Jakob instructed Ordo's members to proactively report their construction plans to Palais Mermonia and to have security, led by Calafia and other Marechaussee Hunters, oversee the construction process to alleviate any suspicions from the Court of Fontaine.[33]

Rene's Second Failure[]
Afterward, the society began the process of rebuilding the "Four Orthants." Rene's plan required a pure Oceanid, but after the cataclysm, Fontaine only had Tainted Hydro Phantasms,[34][35] which were considered inferior mutants of Oceanids.[5] Therefore, Rene shifted his focus to more actively include Lyris. The two eventually convinced Lyris to join the Ordo, despite initial reluctance on her part,[12] and brought her with them into the yet-unfinished Tower of Ipsissimus. Other Ordo members were aware of this, but did not know why.[33] The reason was that, as a being of pure water, Lyris had the ability to extract and merge people's wills (and her own essence, when purified, could also be used for this purpose).[2][9] This would prove very useful for Rene and Jakob's goal.
Rene eventually made the decision to become "the first subject" of his radical experimentation and have his personality removed, in order to "avoid receiving a Vision by some error." Rene believed that receiving a Vision would mean "[selling] oneself to the 'fate' of this world."[36] He also believed that success would allow him to extract and save Carter, and regain Alain's and Mary-Ann's trust. During the ritual, he used the sword alongside Lyris' purified essence to dissolve himself into a pure base personality for the gestalt. However, the ritual was a failure, and Rene was almost dissolved completely into the pure waters, only partially saved by Jakob through some unspecified method.[9]

Creating Narzissenkreuz[]
Recognizing that the Ordo would disband if Rene's condition became public, Jakob was forced to take charge and pretend that all was well, despite his terror. He came up with a lie that Rene was performing "the Great Ritual" deep within the tower and could not be disturbed, with Jakob acting as his representative for its duration.[33] Meanwhile, Jakob desperately researched for a way to bring back Rene, still believing they could succeed and even bring back Carter, sharing his progress to Rene despite Rene's inability to respond. Mary-Ann apparently became aware that something was wrong and sought out Jakob; not knowing how to answer her, but not wanting to lie, he ended up lashing out in anger, after which she finally broke off ties with the Ordo.
Over time, construction of the Tower of Ipsissimus was completed, while Jakob maintained his lie about the Master (Rene)'s ritual.[33] Jakob became used to projecting confidence, and even expressed disappointment that no one in the Ordo had suspected anything. He managed to reextract Rene's persona and stored it within the Orthants. He learned of the alchemist Rhinedottir and the Hexenzirkel, who created a form of research which he decided to pursue. Recognizing he would need test subjects, Jakob was initially torn but steeled himself to do anything necessary for success.[9]
Jakob soon found suitable subjects in a faction of the Ordo led by Zenaida, who had become suspicious of Rene's condition. The members were presumably dissolved and extracted like Rene was, while their disappearance was covered up by a note claiming they had left the Ordo.[33] With his newfound knowledge, the Sword of Narzissenkreuz, and Lyris' purified essence, Jakob constructed prosthetic bodies out of pure water for the extracted personas, though many of the forms did not last for long. In the end, the only surviving subjects were "unstable blobs of water with rudimentary human forms." However, this was enough to proceed with Rene. Jakob supplemented his formula with some of the material from Carter's corrupted form, as well as the pocketwatch given to him by Alain, which he had never dared to give up due to its emotional significance. He named the successful gestalt body "Narzissenkreuz" — the new Master of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo — and implanted Rene's persona within it, but removing Rene's memories of his "two previous failures" (likely referring to Carter's corruption and Rene's near-dissolution in his previous ritual), as Jakob believed the knowledge would "obstruct [Rene's] path to transcendence."[9] This was successful; Rene became the basis of the gestalt Narzissenkreuz and returned to leadership of the Ordo, though he realized that his memories did not match Jakob's records.[37] Jakob and the Master later used the remnants of "them" (likely Carter's remains and/or the leftovers from the testing on Zenaida's Ordo faction) for further experiments, such as grafting onto "those who have lost their intellect."[9] Caterpillar was a result of these experiments and served as an "exhibit" for the Ordo.[2]

Conflict with the Court[]
Later, the Master sent Lyris[38] and Jakob to four specific locations for a secret mission. Their tasks were to "deconstruct" and "reverse the utility" of "Seal of Chymical Marriage," as well as "internalize" an unknown entity or concept.[2][39] Dwight Lasker received an investigation report indicating abnormal activities within the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, which was hidden within the Institute of Natural Philosophy.[40] He assigned his old friend, Emanuel Guillotin, to conduct further investigations into this society. The Master eventually dissolved and absorbed the consciousnesses of three agents, including Emanuel Guillotin[41] and the Champion Duelist Marfisa,[42] gaining their memories and skills. Through this, the Master learned that the Court of Fontaine had officially made a certain decision regarding the Narzissenkreuz Ordo.[43]
The Master considered Jakob's wishes not to fight the Guillotin siblings and the friendship Alain and Rene had once had, and used the "Book of Revealing" to show Alain the impending apocalypse they had calculated in an attempt to persuade him to join the Ordo's plans. However, Alain once again rebuked the offer, only saying, "it seems that there's no going back" before leaving.[44] Though the Master was displeased by Alain's refusal, he promised to create a future with a place for both him and Mary-Ann.[43]

Fights Within Elynas' Remnants[]
The Master issued orders for Ordo members including Jakob, Caterpillar, and Lyris to head into Elynas' remnants to carry out their mission, which was actually a ploy to attract the attention of the Marechaussee Hunters and draw attention away from Narzissenkreuz.[2]
Alain and Seymour noticed that the Narzissenkreuz Ordo was attempting to reanimate Elynas. They immediately reported this to Neuvillette.[45] Neuvillette declared the Ordo an illegal extremist group and a criminal organization. He and Alain jointly signed the Mermonia Act (No. 172), ordering the arrest of the Ordo's members and the sealing of the Tower of Ipsissimus.[46] Mary-Ann went to the remnants of Elynas, while Alain presumably went to the Tower of Ipsissimus, correctly believing Narzissenkreuz would be there. At some point during their confrontation, Narzissenkreuz fell into the Primordial Sea hidden beneath the Tower of Ipsissimus.[47]
Inside the remnants of Elynas, the Ordo members engaged Mary-Ann and Seymour with their clockwork meka. During the battle, "someone" (likely Jakob, who was later confirmed to have damaged Seymour) triggered an explosion, causing a massive shockwave that resulted in heavy casualties. The Narzissenkreuz Ordo members present were defeated, while Mary-Ann was fatally injured, dissolved and absorbed by Lyris, and Seymour sustained damage from the explosion. However, Jakob managed to survive the incident and survives to the present day.[10]

Present Day[]
In the present day, Jakob remains hidden in Fontaine and travels to various locations to reverse the "Seal of Chymical Marriage," preparing for the revival of Narzissenkreuz. He has performed rituals in locations such as Elynas and Erinnyes Forest, causing the emergence of numerous riftwolves and Local Legends[Note 3] at the areas where the seal was reversed.[2][48]
Jakob's research into the Primordial Sea was later used as the basis for Vacher's research, although his exact writings have not been disclosed.[30] In his attempts to bring back his lover Vigneire, Vacher inadvertently caused the merging of consciousness among his victims and created an Oceanid.
In the present day, Jakob posed as a painting collector to attract the attention of the Melusine Mamere, hiring a group of Eremites — Irus, Kaykaus and Kaykubad — to buy paintings from her. However, the true purpose of the operation was to collect Elynas' congealed blood, which Mamere had unknowingly been using as paint.
Unable to obtain enough blood, he attempted to revive Elynas for more, which the great being believed was Jakob trying to thank him. After being defeated by the Traveler, Jakob asked them who they were, having underestimated them. However, he managed to trap the Traveler and made his escape, having taken enough blood for "the appointed time" and anticipating that Elynas' revival would see the Traveler and their companions digested. Instead, Elynas freed the Traveler and asked them to stop his heart in order to protect his children, the Melusines.[1][10]
Later, Jakob unsealed the entrance to the Primordial Sea and attempted to create the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz in order to free the Master and create the new world. However, the Traveler, Ann, Seymour and Caterpillar were able to obtain the item "Persona" before he could. After being defeated by the Traveler at the Ordo's meeting chamber atop the Tower of Ipsissimus, Jakob instructed the group on what was needed to craft the sword, helping to reforge the Holy Blade. This caused the Doomsday Clock embedded in the Chamber's Ceiling to finally strike twelve, signaling the apocalypse; the hands of the Clock fell, crushing Jakob and presumably killing him.[2]

Trivia[]
In Ann's Story, there is a Hydro Mimic Frog from the Narzissenkreuz Adventure Team named Jak, whose name is derived from Jakob, and whose personality is derived from Mary-Ann Guillotin and Lyris' memories of him.

Notes[]

↑ In Rene's Investigation Notes, Rene states that the world-formula's deductions go "all the way until the second flood period's [...] tail end," after which the predictions ended with the world's destruction. As such, while Rene's description of his vision during the World Quest Book of Esoteric Revelations does not directly mention to a flood, the second diluvian period is likely what leaves the world in ruins.

↑ In Enigmatic Page (IV), Rene mentions an unnamed book whose purpose is similar to the Book of Revealing's, the latter which is rediscovered during the World Quest Book of Esoteric Revelations. However, a flashback set during Rene's decision to create the Book of Revealing starts by mentioning to Jakob that "It looks like he won't help us anymore. [...] Moreover, we still have to find a way to cure him," which indicates the flashback takes place after Carter's failed transformation and the end of Rene and Alain's working relationship, events which were recorded in Enigmatic Page (V). This may suggest that the book mentioned in Enigmatic Page (IV) was a predecessor to the current Book of Revealing.
