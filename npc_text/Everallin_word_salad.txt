Dialogue[]

Everallin: Hello there. The wind and the waves are both placid today. That makes for less stories, but at least people will sail in safety.
 Stories?
Everallin: The harbor is not a place where waters and ships cross paths, but also one where stories gather.
Everallin: Many tourists, merchants, and even lovers of books from the land of deserts and rainforests come here.
Everallin: Many people love chatting with me, because that would be the first time they've ever met a Melusine.
Everallin: Thanks to everyone, I've also heard lots of stories from beyond these waters. It's great working here.
 Tell me about the sea.
Everallin: Observing the sea is my job, and I love it. While I'm around, you've nothing to fear from storms or showers — I'll warn everyone ahead of time.
Everallin: Oh, right, I didn't say so earlier, but I'm a Melusine — according to Monsieur Neuvillette, we have a deep connection to the ocean.
Everallin: And even amongst us, I'm one of the best at sensing the ocean's movements. That's why I've been assigned to work here.
Everallin: I just need to report on said movements and I don't have to wander out into the deep seas, so it's a pretty comfy job.
 Deep sea...
Everallin: To be honest, I am not sure if my understanding of the sea's depth is the same as that which human beings sense.
Everallin: All I know is, diving is difficult for most human beings, and requires a heavy set of clothing and a lot of training.
Everallin: Do you know how to dive? It's okay if you don't. I brought these from the sea, and I want to share them with you.
(Obtain  Beryl Conch ×4)
 It does seem like a nice gig.
Everallin: Yup, I think so too.
