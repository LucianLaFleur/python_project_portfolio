Urakusai (Japanese: 有楽斎) was a kitsune in Inazuma known for his literary works, including the original Chronicles of the Six Kitsune.
He was an associate of the Kitsune Saiguu's up until five hundred years ago;[1] while it is unknown what exactly he did, his actions apparently may have contributed to the Abyss' invasion of Teyvat during the cataclysm.[2] He created and wielded the Uraku Misugiri, but never used it against another living being.[3]

Profile[]
During the Kitsune Saiguu's time, she took an interest in Urakusai's literary abilities and tastes in tea; as a result, Urakusai became famed as "one of the most cultured and sophisticated of all the kitsune" by the time the author of New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune was born.

Story[]
It is unknown how long Urakusai has lived, but he recounted tales from the era of Hakushin, the matriarch of the Hakushin Clan, and her apprentices.
According to legend, he once earned the enmity of the bake-danuki by cutting the screen curtains of their stage with the Uraku Misugiri during a drunken reverie. He later apologized to the bake-danuki who held the play and gifted them his teaset and other treasures. To thank Arataki of the Front Gate, who helped mediate between the two parties, he gifted him the Misugiri.[3]
Five hundred years ago, before the start of the cataclysm, Urakusai made a "mistake" that greatly incited the Kitsune Saiguu's wrath. She banished him to parts unknown, then left the Grand Narukami Shrine to reside in Tenshukaku, predicting the impending catastrophe and deciding that she had to stay close to Ei to better protect Inazuma.[2]
Urakusai's fate after his banishment is unknown, although the author of New Chronicles believes that whatever he did five hundred years was connected to the Abyss.[2]
Eventually, Urakusai died, and his memories were absorbed into the Ley Lines in the Sacred Sakura's roots. His spirit remained dormant until recently, when he heard a down-on-his-luck light novelist named Tomoyuki yell "Please, someone, anyone! Help me write a truly amazing novel!" Urakusai's curiosity was piqued, and he possessed Tomoyuki and wrote the light novel A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits. He included a real summoning incantation in the novel, so that anyone who tried out the incantation would be possessed by Urakusai's fellow youkai spirits, who would be able to walk the mortal realm for a couple of days. The possession incidents caught the attention of the Traveler, Paimon, and Yae Miko, who arranged a ritual to summon Urakusai by having him possess the Traveler's body. After catching up with Miko, Urakusai returned to whence he came.[4]

Trivia[]
Urakusai's name may be derived from Oda Nagamasu, who also went by the name Urakusai (Japanese: 有楽斎). Notably, both Nagamasu and Urakusai are noted for their expertise in tea; Nagamasu was a master of the Japanese tea ceremony who learned directly from Sen no Rikyū.
