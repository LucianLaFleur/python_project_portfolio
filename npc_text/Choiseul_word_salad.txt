Dialogue[]

Choiseul: Awesome! Everything in the Fontaine Research Institute is so well organized!
 Looks like everything's fine at the Institute today.
Choiseul: Of course, everything is running smoothly, like clockwork! This is how the New Fontaine Research Institute operates, it's truly incredible!
Choiseul: But the negative influence Edwin Eastinghouse had on the Fontaine Research Institute cannot be erased overnight. We still have much work ahead of us.
Choiseul: First, we must guarantee that researchers have an excellent environment conducive to their work! This will also encourage them to engage in fair and beneficial competition...

 Okay, that's enough of that...
Choiseul: Oh, sorry about that. I'm just so excited to see you that I got carried away for a moment there.
Choiseul: All in all, everything's on track at the Fontaine Research Institute. Reconstruction is now officially on the schedule as well.
Choiseul: In fact, we've already begun work on some lighter projects, and we're about to start recruiting researchers again.
Choiseul: We're flourishing, wouldn't you say? It's fantastic!
 This is where I'll take my leave.
Choiseul: Goodbye. The Fontaine Research Institute welcomes you at any time.
