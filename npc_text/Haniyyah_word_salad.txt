Profile[]
Haniyyah is a famous professional beast tamer in Sumeru. In her youth, she grew to despise fungi due to regularly hearing stories about her ancestors nearly getting killed by a group of berserk fungi. She used to work for the Eremites training Sumpter Beasts as beasts of burden. Due to her expertise, she was hired by the organizers of the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament to test the capabilities of the Wisdom Orb, where she acquired a Whirling Pyro Fungus and initially called it "Pyro-1". She then fought the Traveler in the finals but ultimately lost to them.
After Paimon and the Traveler took over as hosts of the tournament, following Elchingen's arrest, Haniyyah took the domesticated fungi and the competitors' Wisdom Orbs for safekeeping until the next tournament.
Haniyyah would later head to Fontaine in order to find investors for an official tournament and increase awareness of the positive aspects of fungi. 

Appearance[]
Haniyyah takes the appearance of an Eremite Axe Vanguard with pink hair.
