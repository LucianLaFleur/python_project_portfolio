Appearance[]
Watanabe wears a standard uniform modeled from the ashigaru (Japanese: 足軽) of feudal Japan. He wears a purple-gray shitagi, gray kobakama, white socks, and waraji sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with gray accents consists of dou (breastplate) with the Inazuma Shogunate's crest, han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves). He is equipped with a juumonji yari (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead.

Dialogue[]

Watanabe: I should really push these new guys harder. Tomorrow, I'll make them stand at attention for half an hour and then give them a set of one hundred push-ups.
 Who are you?
Watanabe: I'm a Doushin in charge of recruit training here. You can call me Instructor Watanabe.
Watanabe: I've got to say that the recruits nowadays lack perseverance and patience. How will they serve the Shogun like that?
Watanabe: Eh... why am I telling you this stuff? No outsiders are allowed on the drill grounds!
 Goodbye.
Watanabe: Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!
