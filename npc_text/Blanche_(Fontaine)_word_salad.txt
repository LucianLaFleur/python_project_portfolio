Profile[]
In her infancy, Blanche was abandoned by her parents in Fontaine's wilderness. She was discovered by "Tricky Bulle Fruit", who had been out scavenging. He decided to adopt her and they viewed each other as siblings.
As Blanche saw her adopted brother as role model, she wanted to become a Treasure Hoarder when she grew up, something which he was not particularly fond of. To that end, he decides to ensure that she would enjoy her life and soon stumbled upon a formula for "Pure Water", which he intends to use for her own well-being and betrays the Fruity Order. The Traveler first encounters Blanche in the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering Region, where two of her brother's colleagues demands to know of his whereabouts. The Traveler steps in and they help her find her brother, who had been hiding in a house nearby to perfect the formula.
The Fruity Order, upset by the betrayal, sends "Ruthless Calla Lily" to silence him. After a brief fight that results in her defeat, Blanche gives her a copy of the formula to apologize on her brother's behalf, which she accepts and leaves. After sending the formula to the Fontaine Research Institute, he found Blanche a photography tutor and sent himself to the Fortress of Meropide. Blanche left behind a letter and two "super huge, super sweet" Bulle Fruits at Fontaine's Adventurers' Guild branch for the Traveler and Paimon.
