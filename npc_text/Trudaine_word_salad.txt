 New fabrics...
Media:VO Trudaine 01.ogg "I heard down the grapevine that Chioriya Boutique just got some new fabrics in."

Dialogue[]

Trudaine: Have you heard? It seems that new fabrics have arrived at Chioriya Boutique. I heard that from my husband — he's a well-informed one, he is.
Graciette: Really? Well, my husband knows that too. He's helped me pre-order them, too. Would you like me to send you a share?
Trudaine: Oh, that's fine. I'll just keep observing the product — a decision can come later.
Trudaine: Oh, and by the way, the limited edition perfume I bought previously is coming in soon. Would you like some? I can lend it to you.
Graciette: Well, I just so happen to have one of those myself. It's one of Ms. Emilie's, isn't it? They tell me that there aren't a lot of them this time, and that they're selling out before they can even hit shelves!
Trudaine: My, oh my, as expected of a merchant family, I suppose. If I miss any seasonal specials next time, I suppose I'll need you to help me out.
Graciette: Oh, it's nothing. I mean, will we not still have to rely on that judge of yours in matters of importance?
