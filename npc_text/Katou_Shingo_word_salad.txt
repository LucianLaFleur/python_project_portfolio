Profile[]
Katou Shingou is the older brother of Katou Youhei. He and his brother dreamed of establishing their own dojo for a living. He became a student of Meikyou Shisui Art after begging Domon to take him in. However, due to his laziness and negligence, he was kicked out.
During the popularity of the book A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits, he and his brother performed a summoning ritual in order to gain swordsmanship that will allow the brother to build their own dojo for a living. The spirit they've summoned possessed Shingou and helped him defeat Domon's best apprentice.
