Aranimba is an Aranara. In the past, he used to stick together with Araminali and Arayama, and the three of them were happy no matter what they did. He would travel across Sumeru, draw pictures of the scenery he encountered on his journey, and send them back to a mailbox in Vanarana (Subarea). 
During one of his journeys, Aranimba eventually ended up leaving Sumeru and entered The Chasm. There, he met a "dark and dangerous Nara," so he turned into a seed to hibernate and protect himself. However, prolonged hibernation in a place without much soil and grass dehydrated him, so he shrank and shriveled. The Traveler and Paimon would eventually discover Aranimba in the form of the Shriveled Seed. 
When they traveled to Sumeru, the Traveler and Paimon would eventually find his friend Araminali, who suggested that he should be given lots of water so he may be restored to his original form. After a brief reunion with Araminali, Aranimba would depart on a journey again,[1] visiting places in Valuka (The Great Red Sand and the Desert of Hadramaveth), a place most of his kind dread to visit.[2]
