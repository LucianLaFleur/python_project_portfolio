Dialogue[]

Pinghai: Hmm? If you want to go out to sea or catch some fish and stuff, go find another sailor. This boat of mine receives guests bound for the Pearl Galley only.
 The Pearl Galley is where I'm bound.
Pinghai: Ah, forgive me. So you are to be an honored guest. Come, this way, please.
 What's this Pearl Galley you speak of?
Pinghai: Well, it's normal to not know.
Pinghai: The Pearl Galley is where the wealthy bigwigs of Liyue pass their time. It's no place for plebeians.
Pinghai: With the exception of honored guests, any ordinary person who goes onboard will just be there as an onlooker.
Pinghai: Well, I've said quite a bit, haven't I? If there's anything else, don't waste more of my time.
 I've got nothing.
Pinghai: Off with you, then. How dull...
