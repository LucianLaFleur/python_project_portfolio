Dialogue[]

Rie: Hello there, friend from afar. Are you going shopping?
Rie: As it happens, I'm doing so too. Would you mind if I join you?
 Could you tell me more about this street?
Rie: This street is the busiest place in Inazuma. Not only can you get the daily necessities here, but you can also purchase rare, high-end, and exotic goods. It's my favorite spot.

Rie: It's a shame that you've come at such a moment. If it were before the Sakoku Decree, you would even be able to find fine liquor from Mondstadt or handcrafted jewelry from Liyue.
Rie: Now, I would recommend that you check out the old local stores, like Ogura Textiles & Kimonos. You will even find the latest and finest outfits there.
(After completing Transient Dreams)

Rie: If you're new, I would recommend that you check out the old local stores, like Ogura Textiles & Kimonos. You will find the latest and the finest outfits there.
Rie: The owner of Yayoi Lacquerware seems to have lived abroad before. She can perform craftsmanship that would otherwise be unique to Sumeru.
Rie: There's also Netsuke no Gen Crafts... and Uyuu Restaurant...
Rie: If you have already seen every corner of this street, you can also check Hanamizaka out... However...
 However...?
Rie: Ah, don't get me wrong. Hanamizaka is also a fine place to check out. You can go to Yae Publishing House to buy a novel, have a fine meal at Kiminami Restaurant... That would already make for a leisurely day indeed.
Rie: However, I heard rumors that there was a weirdo with a pair of long horns frequenting Hanamizaka...
Rie: I've heard that this man is very mean and overbearing, so much so that even Madam Kujou Sara from the Tenryou Commission considers him a headache.
Rie: But I've also heard it said that this weird man is not a thug. He just hangs out with the children all day, playing card games or setting up a bug-fighting arena...
Rie: I'm not sure if I should buy into any of these rumors... Anyway, if you happen to find yourself there, it's best to be a bit more careful.
 You're really familiar, aren't you?
Rie: Indeed. I have all the spare money in the world but nothing to do with it, so shopping is my greatest hobby. My family also runs a business, so I check the market regularly to stay informed.
Rie: Oh, right. If you find anything interesting while checking the market out, remember to let me know.
 Goodbye.
Rie: Bye. This place is worth your time, I guarantee it.
