 Hyper-emotional...
Media:VO Hagihara 01.ogg "I think the hyper-emotional element you're adding is just, uh... gratuitous."

Dialogue[]

Arnim: This section here... and this bit here... I feel that more romantic elements need to be added here to allow the readers to experience the emotions within.
Hagihara: Mr. Arnim, please allow me to remind you that adding "romantic descriptions" does not mean adding a few personal opinions too many to the text.
Hagihara: We are here to draw inspiration from cultural performances from other lands, not to mutate their stories with our personal sentiments.
Arnim: Tsk, tsk. What did I expect of a writer of deductive novels — of course you know nothing of poetic beauty.
Arnim: A poem that is to be recited, whether romantic or ironic, must have pulse with an emotional rhythm.
Hagihara: ... I have a feeling that you're simply avoiding the crux of the issue here.
Hagihara: *sigh* If you cannot answer my questions directly, then at least don't add on whatever you please, whenever you please.
