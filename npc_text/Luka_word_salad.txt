Event Dialogue[]

Luka: Ah, what a lovely day! Well, are you ready for a taste of the bartender life?
 Let's give it a shot.
Luka: Wonderful! I wish you good luck today as well.
 About "Bartender Academy Week"...
Luka: Well, this activity was originally intended to enlist new talent for our tavern.
Luka: The drinkers are many, but those who mix drinks are few. Charles can barely get a single day off all year...
Luka: As such, we started this event to help drum up interest in the bartending occupation!
Luka: What do you think, Traveler? What do you say?"
 It's an intriguing prospect.
Luka: Aha, that's what I love to hear! Guess this was all worth it!
 It was pretty tough...
Luka: Ah, I see, I suppose the work was quite difficult.
Luka: Whatever the case, the atmosphere in the tavern while you were there was great. In fact, the streets have been filled with customers this entire time...
Luka: And while this wasn't our original intention, all's well that ends well, don't you think?
 See you.
Luka: Sure, no problem. Please come back whenever you've got the time.
