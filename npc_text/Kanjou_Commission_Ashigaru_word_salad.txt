Kanjou Commission Ashigaru are members of the Kanjou Commission stationed in Ritou, Inazuma.
When attempting to leave Ritou by foot before completing the World Quest Chisato's Letter, a generic NPC entitled "Kanjou Commission Ashigaru" will stop the Traveler from leaving.
In the Archon Quest Confessions of an Outlander, Werner mentions that Keijirou is a tax-collection ashigaru. Keijirou's in-game title, however, is simply "Kanjou."

Dialogue[]

(Approach the borders of Ritou without a Travel Permit)
Kanjou Commission Ashigaru: Hey, stop! Who is there!
Paimon: Oh no... It's someone from the Kanjou Commission, we've been caught!
(Teleport back to Ritou)
(If Ritou Escape Plan has not been completed)

Kanjou Commission Ashigaru: Without a Travel Permit, you cannot enter or leave Ritou.
Paimon: It seems if you do not have a Travel Permit, you cannot freely enter or leave the island.
(If Ritou Escape Plan has been completed)

Paimon: According to our agreement, we'll get that Travel Permit once we deliver Miss Chisato's letter, right?

Trivia[]
In feudal Japan, ashigaru were infantrymen employed by samurai.
