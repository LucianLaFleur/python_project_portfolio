Dialogue[]

Nanaya Yuumi: The illustrations on some of the cards are really pretty, don't you think? I'm trying to collect them all.
Nanaya Yuumi: Beauty is also one form of victory! What do you say? You up for a game of Genius Invokation TCG?
 It would be rude to refuse.

 Maybe later...
Nanaya Yuumi: Okay. If you chance upon any card that looks good, please do let me know.
