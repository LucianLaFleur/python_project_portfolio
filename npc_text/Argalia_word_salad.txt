 Lynette...

Dialogue[]

Argalia: Should I redo my storage plan for the tableware again...?
 What about the tableware?
Argalia: Well, I'm currently considering how to arrange the various utensils we use here at the hotel.
Argalia: I used to place them in a rack close to the outside, which would make them easy to take and use.
Argalia: But Lynette once knocked them over when she was invited to perform here, causing them to clatter to the ground, shattering on impact.
Argalia: Fortunately, Lynette wasn't hurt — everyone would surely have been grieved if her beautiful face was injured by mistake...
 I happen to agree with you.
Argalia: I know, right?
Argalia: Back then, Lynette didn't blame us for not taking care of the tableware better. She even apologized, saying that this sort of thing always happens to her...
Argalia: Maybe she only said that so we wouldn't feel too awkward about things. I mean, she seems rather cold, but she's actually super modest and polite!
 Eh? There's another one of you...
Argalia: Ah, you must've met my elder sister downstairs, huh?
Argalia: We're twins, and most people can't tell us apart by appearance. We sound very different, though, so we get exposed the moment we open our mouths.
Argalia: My sister speaks slow, but she's a careful sort. If you need help on the first floor of the restaurant, just leave it to her.
 See you.
Argalia: Come back any time!
