Dialogue[]

Ariana: Compared to my hometown, the bustling life here suits me better.
 About your hometown...
Ariana: My hometown is Sumeru City. My family is still there. I moved to Port Ormos to look after the ship.
Ariana: The people back in Sumeru, especially the Akademiya researchers, all walked at a pace way too leisurely for me!
Ariana: Life here is busy, fulfilling, and more profitable — much better than back home.
Ariana: Even the hot curry I get after work tastes better.
 Curry...
Ariana: Yeah. Curry is one thing that everyone in Sumeru knows how to cook.
Ariana: Its flavor varies from family to family because every family has their own curry recipe.
Ariana: But most of their curry tastes great.
Ariana: So, would you like to have a taste of my recipe?
(Obtain  Curry Shrimp ×3)
 See you.
Ariana: See you. May you lead a fulfilling life.
