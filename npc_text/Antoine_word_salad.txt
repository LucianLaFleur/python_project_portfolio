 Break free...
Media:VO Antoine 01.ogg "Humanity doesn't have to be land bound, we can break free! It's our destiny!"

Dialogue[]

Antoine: Humans should break free of the shackles of the earth and soar into the skies! Don't you think so too?
 Err, you are...
Antoine: Antoine Roger's the name, and clockwork engineering's the game. My specialty? The eternal dream of humanity: flight!
Antoine: Now, you might be curious, and rightly so, as to how this might be different from Edwin Eastinghouse's research. In which case, let me explain!
Antoine: I generate propulsion using energy converted from the annihilation reaction between pneuma and ousia, which powers my aircraft's movement!
Antoine: What do you think? If you'd like to give it a try, hop aboard the Antoine Roger Aircraft and activate it using an annihilation reaction!
Antoine: It will move along the designated path — accident-free travel guaranteed!
 Is it really safe?
Antoine: ...
Antoine: Absolutely, positively — according to my calculations and simulation experiments, that is!
 Is this work for the Fontaine Research Institute?
Antoine: Ah, what are you talking about? The Institute has been rendered a ruin. Its capacity for research has been lost! All that remains is the official agency.
Antoine: But what cannot be denied is that many independent engineers — of whom I am one — still use kinetic cores designed by Guillotin, the Institute's founder.
Antoine: The aircraft is merely one step in the realization of my goals.
Antoine: My final objective is the creation of sufficiently powerful and affordable kinetic cores.
Antoine: I wish to attain greatness like that of Guillotin and build something that can change Fontaine.
Antoine: Imagine a nation as I envision it, dear friend. Humans freed from gravity, free to fly through the skies.
Antoine: Clockwork meka shall perform all the labor we need on the ground.
Antoine: While we, having primacy over all other beings, shall be freed from such. We shall be free to think, to produce art, to develop culture!
Antoine: Is this not lovely?
 See you.
Antoine: You have a wonderful day!
