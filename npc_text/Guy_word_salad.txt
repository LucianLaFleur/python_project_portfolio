Profile[]
Guy is a guard from the Knights of Favonius.  He is the son of a farmer named Tunner who works for the Dawn Winery farm. As a child, he dreamed of becoming a knight. So his father spent a lot of money for his training to provide a better future for him.[1] He started his knights training at the age of eight, learned swordsmanship two years later and became a squire when he was sixteen.[1][2]

Appearance[]
Guy wears one of the standard uniforms of the Knights of Favonius. The uniform consists of a black long-sleeve shirt, horse riding pants, gloves, and brown leather shoulder pads with brass-accented white plate armor worn on top. His vambraces however are black. Wing motifs decorate various parts of the armor along with the Knights of Favonius crest on the breastplate. A sheathed sword hangs from his belt on his left side and a blowing horn hangs from the back of his hip.

Dialogue[]

Guy: Another meaningless day...
Guy: Oh! Do you need a hand with anything? B—But never mind if you don't though!
 What are you doing?
Guy: I'd like to know as well... What are you doing here, Guy?
Guy: Alright, I'm guarding the side gate on Mondstadt. As everyone knows, it's a gate that no one uses.
Guy: Mock me all you want. I know it's a pointless job.
 You seem upset.
Guy: Of course I'm upset.
Guy: I've started training at the age of 8, learned swordsmanship at the age of 10, and became a squire at 16...
Guy: I'm the pride of my family, yet I'm tasked with such a job...
Guy: As a member of the Knights of Favonius, guarding the side gate is like Cat's Tail without Diona. There's no soul in it!
Guy: ...Anyway, have you bumped into any trouble? Any kind at all — let me see if I can help! I am a Knight of Favonius after all!
Guy: Oh... Okay then...
 Goodbye.
Guy: Please do come to me when you need help...
Guy: Well, forget it. You won't remember me anyway...

Event Dialogue[]
