Profile[]
Gobley is a member of Narzam's gang of Treasure Hoarders in Sumeru. After Alrani's research thesis was rejected yet again, she made her way to Narzam's group and asked them to lock her up, even paying them to do so. Gobley states that the gang was initially planning on robbing her, since they were out of money, but they were taken aback by her appearance and behavior. He says the group did not know what to do with Alrani until Narzam decided to fulfill her request. When the Traveler arrives looking for Alrani, Gobley tries to explain the misunderstanding, but does not manage to do so until after the Traveler has beat up the entire gang. He then directs the Traveler to Alrani's location and says that they would even pay the Traveler to take Alrani back.
