Dialogue[]

Karpillia: Hey, how about trying some fine wine from Mondstadt? It's the real deal, authenticity guaranteed!
 Do you only sell liquor? (Only available after completing Chisato's Letter)
Karpillia: Um, too young to drink, are you? Well, we do sell other stuff too, like Mondstadt's famous Dandelion Wine...'s brewing ingredients!
Karpillia: That's a Mondstadt specialty. It's not supposed to be in the inventory list. But since you're also an outlander like me, I will make an exception and sell you those.

(If the player loses the match)

Karpillia: Hehe, another one down. It's a hard game. It's only natural that you weren't able to overcome me.
(If the player wins the match)

Karpillia: Huh... How can this be? Did I make a mistake somewhere?
 About this shop...
Karpillia: This shop is the exclusive seller of fine liquor from Mondstadt.
Karpillia: Our ciders are all brewed from the purest water of Cider Lake and the freshest fruits from Mondstadt. We make sure that even here in Inazuma, our customers shall have the finest and most authentic Mondstadt drinks!
Karpillia: So if you choose the finest liquor from Mondstadt, choose Sailing Breeze!
 How's business been?
(Before completing Transient Dreams)

Karpillia: It's not bad. After all, liquor from Mondstadt is the best in Teyvat.
Karpillia: But the Sakoku Decree has really created some difficulty in the transportation of supplies. That's a headache...
Karpillia: I have no idea what will happen if we use local ingredients. Ugh...
(After completing Transient Dreams)

Karpillia: It's not bad. After all, liquor from Mondstadt is the best in Teyvat.
Karpillia: The moment the Sakoku Decree ended, I had clients coming up to me to place some orders. And what do you know — Mondstadt's Dandelion Wine was number one on the list!
Karpillia: Now that the thunderstorm surrounding Inazuma has dispersed, cargo-carrying ships should be able to get here quickly. Once that happens, never mind our clientele... I'll be able to get a good drink myself.
Karpillia: *cough* I mean, after work, of course!
 Would your liquor be better than the Dawn Winery's?
Karpillia: Well, I'm sure we'd...
Karpillia: Ah, never mind. As a drinker myself, I can't go against my conscience in this matter.
Karpillia: I have to admit that Dawn Winery's drinks are better. Even I prefer them.
Karpillia: Our store was actually forced to sell here because we couldn't compete with Angel's Share.
Karpillia: But the businesses under Dawn Winery have practically monopolized the liquor industry in Mondstadt. I... don't really think that's a good thing.
 Goodbye.
Karpillia: Goodbye! See you next time!
