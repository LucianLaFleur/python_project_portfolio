Dialogue Set #1[]

Arayash: Festival Utsava... a bit troublesome... Must take good care of this place, must take good care of everyone's safety...
 Something's on your mind?
Arayash: Ah, it's the Golden Nara...
Arayash: How embarrassing... Festival Utsava should be a happy festival for everyone, but when thinking about how some very bad people will try to intrude on this festival, it's not nice anymore.
Arayash: So I am a little unhappy...
 I will defeat the bad guys.
Arayash: Golden Nara looks skilled enough to defeat bad guys.
Arayash: But Arayash doesn't want Golden Nara's help, because Golden Nara is the guest of Aranara.
 About the Statue of The Seven...
Arayash: This is the stone of the Lord of Trees and the Lord of Dendro! It's very important!
 Goodbye.
Arayash: Goodbye, Golden Nara. I hope you won't meet any bad guys.

Dialogue Set #2[]

Arayash: Festival Utsava is over, and Marana has been defeated too. Vanarana is safe.
 You seem rather pleased.
Arayash: Yes, because Marana was defeated by the amazing Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) and Arama.
Arayash: For Aranara, there is no need to worry about encountering aggressive bad guys outside of Vanarana.
Arayash: This is all thanks to Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) and Arama.
 Goodbye.
Arayash: Goodbye. The Lord of Trees and Lord of Dendro will watch over Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
