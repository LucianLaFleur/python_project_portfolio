Dialogue[]

(After completing Festive Elegance)
Fushizome: Good day, you two.
Fushizome: Are you interested in the art of ikebana?
 "Ikebana"?
Paimon: Huh, Paimon feels like we've heard about this one before...
Fushizome: That's wonderful.
Fushizome: I am currently organizing an event to show off the wonders of ikebana.
Fushizome: In a few days, you, too, will be able to experience its charm.
 Oh, now I'm curious...
Paimon: Alrighty, we'll come back in a couple of days, then!
 I might be... at some point.
Fushizome: Well then, you can come down here in a few days to try ikebana out for yourself. Perhaps you, too, will be charmed by this art.
(After completing The Floral Courtyard: Part I)
Fushizome: In the following days, I will continue to stay here and guide those who come for the Irodori Festival, and help them to enjoy the beauty of the "floral courtyards."
Fushizome: Don't forget to drop by every day to get another "theme." There will be a total of four such themes for you to figure out.
Fushizome: Of course, if you have any other questions, I will do my best to answer them for you.
 About the flowers here...
Fushizome: The flowers I use are all provided by Sakuya's Flowers. The flowers they grow are of impeccable quality and affordable prices.
Fushizome: Perhaps you've met Sakuya as well. We once studied ikebana under the same master.
Fushizome: Sakuya is also very well-studied in the floral arts, but when she heard that there would be tons of people at the Irodori Festival, she seemed to have gotten a bit of stage fright. She said that it would be difficult to quiet down and focus on her work in such an environment.
Fushizome: In any case, I will advertise Sakuya's Flowers on her behalf.
Paimon: We can help too if you need us!
Fushizome: Well then, do the two of you have any other questions?
 Thank you, Ms. Fushizome.
Fushizome: Think nothing of it. If you have time, you can come and look for me any time.
 About the Yashiro Commission's involvement...
Fushizome: The Yashiro Commission has always been very supportive of Inazuma's floral arts. Indeed, the person who sponsored this event is the Shirasagi Himegimi.
Fushizome: She has always been incredibly talented in these arts, even from a young age. I saw her perform ikebana once, and even had the honor of exchanging pointers with her.
Fushizome: Although I'm older than her, I'm nowhere near her ability in terms of skill in ikebana or understanding of the floral arts.
Fushizome: Where circumstances have permitted, she has provided funding to help publicize ikebana every year. I've even heard that she has used her own savings to do so...
Fushizome: She once expressed her frank desire for more people to understand ikebana and to drum up more interest in it such that more might want to practice this art.
Paimon: Huh. So Ayaka did so much for Inazuma's floral arts...
 I hope her wish comes true.
Fushizome: Thank you both. You are indeed good-hearted people.
Fushizome: Well then, do the two of you have any other questions?
 Thank you, Ms. Fushizome.
Fushizome: Think nothing of it. If you have time, you can come and look for me any time.
 I have no further questions at the moment.
Fushizome: Alright, then. You can come and look for me any time.
