Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

Flo: I wonder — what sorts of clothes are in fashion over in the city of Fontaine? Hmm? Are you wearing the latest and greatest, by any chance?
 I—I doubt so...
Flo: Huh. I do think that the clothes you're wearing do have a designer feel to them, though...
Flo: I've never seen their like before. In fact, I thought that they were some new fashion of a sort... Ah, I'd love to try something like that on.
 You love fashionable outfits, don't you?
Flo: Sure do!
Flo: Lovely clothes with their own sense of style can sometimes even give their wearers confidence in their beauty. It's a wonderful thing.
Flo: People who are able to design such clothes are awesome. I, too, really love sewing and design work.
Flo: Sometimes, when I see the beautiful clothes worn by people in the city of Fontaine, I think, "Ah, if only I could put something similar on!"
 Can Melusines wear human clothes, though...
Flo: Well, of course not. Our bodies are very different — even beautiful clothes made for children wouldn't make good direct fits for us...
Flo: But whether we be human or Melusine, our feelings toward lovely clothes are one and the same, and so I wish to create such clothes that Melusines, too, can wear!
(After Step 3 of There Will Come Soft Rains and before completing Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog)
 About the earthquake just a while ago...
Flo: Hmm. Was it just me, or was everything shaking a bit just now?
Flo: Oh dear... Virda said that she'd be going out to train. Will she be alright?
 See you.
Flo: Sure. Please tell me about any beautiful clothes you know of next time we meet, alright?

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Ancient Colors.


Flo: Ah, I heard about what happened from Virda. Thank you for saving her!
Flo: Sorry for the trouble my little sister caused you. I'll remind her to stay safe in the future...
Flo: Oh dear. How could I ever thank you? ... Oh, I know! Why don't I help you design a set of clothes?
Flo: Really, though, I'm only any good at sewing... So how would tights do? I've heard that the thieves and heroes in those stories all love wearing them...
 I think I'll pass on the tights...
Flo: Ah, so you don't like them? Well, if you find clothes that you do like, please, tell me.
Flo: I can imitate even the most fashionable outfits perfectly as long as I have something to model my work after. I'm quite confident in my work in this regard!
 You love fashionable outfits, don't you?
(Dialogue continues same as above)
 Tell me about Virda...
Flo: She's not injured — thanks to you, of course.
Flo: She seems to have gotten all excited about having been able to help out, though. *sigh* I have to wonder if she heard a word I said about staying safe...
 See you...
Flo: Alright. Next time we meet, if you want any nice-looking clothes, you can come to me to get its design worked out...
