Dialogue[]

Behnam: Hello. How can I help you?
 Who are you?
Behnam: The Akademiya sent me here to take charge of overseeing and maintaining the fortification work at the desert's edge. I usually stay in the pitstop.
Behnam: The rainforest is of utmost importance to the lives of Sumeru's people. We can't allow the desert to erode it.
Behnam: Wall of Samiel is our key defense against the sandstorm. We must practice thorough and effective defense with it.
 See you.
Behnam: See you.
