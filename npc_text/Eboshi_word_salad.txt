Dialogue[]

(After finishing Erebos' Secret)
Eboshi: My name is Erebos. In the Inazuman tongue, that would be Eboshi.
Eboshi: You have proven here that your valor is beyond compare — that you are a worthy savior of Sangonomiya's people. Thus, you have earned the right to ask and to be answered.
Eboshi: Still, I ask that you follow the rules and not take the truth beyond this ocean abyss.
Eboshi: What else do you wish to know?
 Tell me about the Bathysmal Vishaps...
Eboshi: They are primordial elemental beings, unbent and unbowed by the power that came from the heavens owing to their living deep underwater.
Eboshi: They are actually very intelligent, and they are adept at evolving. They would even evolve into different elemental forms throughout the history of their war against us.
Eboshi: I would not be surprised at all if they have learned language or perhaps even evolved into lizard-people of a sort.
Eboshi: The Holy Soil phenomenon is, in fact, the expansion of their habitat. That means that the primordial elemental power of the three realms is growing stronger.
Eboshi: Only by using Watatsumi Omikami's life force to awaken its second servant could we convert this raw, raging elemental power.
 Tell me about Watatsumi Omikami...
Eboshi: Watatsumi Omikami, due to ill-fortune, fell into this place, beyond the jurisdiction of the heavenly order.
Eboshi: This was undoubtedly to the good fortune of us, the people of Byakuyakoku. It has done a great many things for us.
Eboshi: Unfortunately, by making contact with us, it also grasped a truth that came before its own existence. Thus, it was forced by heaven to sacrifice itself.
Eboshi: The truth behind this sacrifice had to remain unknown to all. Only thus could the people of Byakuyakoku be allowed to live under the rule of The Seven.
 So, what were things like before the sun and moon?
Eboshi: Before Byakuyakoku fell into the deep sea, the whole world had a single unified culture.
Eboshi: Later, a great war broke out, in which the heavens capsized and the earth was ripped asunder. This land was then plunged into the dark ocean depths.
Eboshi: However, the heavenly order seemed to not wish for those who remembered all this to remain on the earth. We searched and searched for a road of return, but there was none to be found.
Eboshi: Much, much later, heaven's powers of prohibition would gradually weaken. Thus did Watatsumi Omikami manage to fall into this place.
 Tell me about the Dainichi Mikoshi.
Eboshi: The Dainichi Mikoshi was constructed by the Sage Abrax. It has the power to bring light to the dark depths.
Eboshi: It has quite a few other functions, to boot.
Eboshi: All in all, it is a very powerful device.
 I've got nothing else to ask.
Eboshi: Fair enough. Again, please remember to keep all that you have seen here in Enkanomiya an eternal secret.

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
Her Enkanomiya name Erebos likely comes from Erebus (Ancient Greek: Ἔρεβος Erebos, "Darkness"), a primordial deity and the personification of darkness in the Greek mythology.
In the real-life mythology, he is thought to be the father of Aether, the god of bright upper sky (and his sister Hemera, the goddess of day). However, it is unclear whether this genealogy is reflected in this game.
Her Narukami-style name Eboshi (Japanese: 烏帽子 lit. "Raven's Cap") refers to a type of traditional Japanese cap, originally worn by adult men. It is now used in traditional ceremonies (such as prayers by Shinto priests) by both genders.
The name may be also a reference to Tate Eboshi (better known as Suzuka Gozen), a Japanese goddess and powerful oni who is said to have got married with a famous shogun and defeated evil monsters together with her husband.
