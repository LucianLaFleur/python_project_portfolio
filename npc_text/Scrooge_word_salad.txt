  Quest-Exclusive NPCs 




Scrooge is a quest-exclusive NPC aligned with the Treasure Hoarders who appears in the last leg of the Mondstadt Commission A Surprise Gift.
If the player chooses to ask Vile to help them find Rudolf a gift to give to Jilliana, the gift will cause Jilliana to run off to Whispering Woods. The player will follow her there and witness a conversation between herself and Scrooge that reveals she was formerly part of the Treasure Hoarders.
