Profile[]
Boyang is an ancestor of Yelan, and the brother of Rongzhao. He fought alongside Bosacius and Millelith against the monsters from Khaenri'ah 500 years ago at The Chasm. They contrived a stratagem to trap and seal the beasts in the depths of The Chasm by using the Fantastic Compass, a catalyst which had the power to manipulate space. In the critical moments of the fight, Bosacius and Boyang ultimately sacrificed themselves by sealing themselves along with the beasts because the compass needed constant energy flow from a mortal and an adeptus to operate.
