Profile[]
Harunosuke was an onmyouji from the Kamuna Clan, which developed the Kamuna arts utilized in modern times by the Kairagi.[4][5] The arts include paper seals that can coat weapons with elemental energy, even when the users have no Visions. Other developments he is responsible for include the art of Onmyoudou and the creation of Shiki Taishou.[3] He also owned an esoteric domain called the Mystic Onmyou Chamber.[6]

Story[]
Harunosuke, alongside Asase Hibiki and Mikoshi Nagamasa, went to Mt. Yougou to learn the Yougou Tengu's arts from Reizenbou.[7] The three thereafter became known collectively as The Yougou Three.[3] He also became familiar with Takamine the Mistsplitter,[8] after he became a servant of the Great Tengu in exchange for ownership of Thundering Pulse.[9]
During the cataclysm, Ei led a campaign against the dark forces of the Abyss,[10] accompanied by Chiyo, the Great Tengu, the Kitsune Saiguu, and Takamine. Harunosuke expresses his worry over Takamine to Hibiki.[8] Over the course of the cataclysm, Chiyo was corrupted and turned against Ei,[11] while both Takamine[12] and the Kitsune Saiguu disappeared.[13] In the "fury of his mourning," after helplessly watching Kitsune Saiguu sacrifice herself, he left for Liyue to learn the "more powerful 'way of the adepti.'"[3][13]
Some decades later, the bake-danuki Ioroi, unaware of the reason for the Kitsune Saiguu's disappearance and believing she had left him hanging during a game of hide-and-seek, ended up raising trouble in order to try and lure her out. By this point, Harunosuke had returned and was dispatched by the Shogunate to address the issue. He did so by sealing away many of the bake-danuki, including Ioroi, into stone statues.[7][14] However, he did not seal some of them properly, causing some of the bake-danuki to eventually escape their prison.
He also met Hanachirusato, a manifestation of the Kitsune Saiguu's memories, and performed a Minor Purification[15] on Narukami's Sacred Sakuras. During their first meeting, Harunosuke initially mistook Hanachirusato for Saiguu before quickly realizing her true nature as "filth." Nevertheless, he decided to not purify her as well, as she did not pose a danger to Inazuma.[16] After finishing his work, he left locked the ward he used near Saiguu's abandoned shrine, and summoned three Shikigami (the Mysterious Shadows) to guard the ward.
At some point, Harunosuke left Inazuma for Liyue, where he took the adepti arts and fused them with his transcension techniques to create the art of Onmyoudou. He used this new art to create the Mystic Onmyou Chamber and created Shiki Taishou. The chamber was intended to be used to help train the Shogunate forces to help defend their nation from the all threats by having Taishou create replicas of himself to be carried on the samurai as they fought enemies. Magical copies of these enemies would then be stored in the chambers, allowing them to train in relative safety. However, the Shogun's intervention in protecting Inazuma eventually made the existence of the chamber pointless. Shiki Taishou eventually convinced him to let go of his burdens; seeking a new purpose, no matter how long it took, Harunosuke left for areas unknown.

Trivia[]
When Harunosuke refers to "Mr. Takamine" in the Chinese and Japanese versions, he uses the honorific "Uncle" (Chinese: 大叔 dàshū; Japanese: おじさん oji-san),[8] indicating that Takamine was probably almost a generation older than Harunosuke.
Yae Miko could have studied under Harunosuke (who was closely acquainted with her predecessor, the Kitsune Saiguu) or his school, because the Chinese and Japanese names of her Normal Attack contain the term shiki ("law," "ceremony," or "formula"), which can mean shikigami in the context of mystic arts.
Kamuna Harunosuke is mentioned in the description of the following Furnishing: Stone Statue: Giichiro
Etymology[]
His name Harunosuke (Japanese: 晴之介 lit. "Clear Weather's Assistant Head") may be inspired by Seimei (Japanese: 晴明 lit. "Clear and Bright Weather") (921–1005), the greatest onmyouji both in history and in folklore, whose name is sometimes read as Haruaki or Haruakira using kun (native) reading.
As a common noun, the kanji of his surname 惟神 is read as either kamunagara (original) or kannagara (euphonic form), meaning "as the will of kami (Japanese native deities and spirits)." The Way of Kamunagara is a synonym for Shinto.
The fact he went to Liyue to study adepti's power is likely based on the historical fact that onmyoudou, a traditional philosophy of astronomy and divination in Japan, was originally inspired by the yin-yang philosophy in China (onmyou is the euphonic form of in'you, which is the Japanese reading of yin-yang).
In the third line of the sacred words Harunosuke used, his use of "fried tofu" was a nod to inarizushi, which in Japanese culture is traditionally thought to be a favorite food of foxes, the messengers of the Shinto god Inari.
"Bring forth the fried tofu!" was also something Saiguu used to say a lot when she was alive.[citation needed]
