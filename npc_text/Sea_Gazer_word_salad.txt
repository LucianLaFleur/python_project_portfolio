Such is how the world works. What one may fail to do, two may succeed. I have spent much time gazing at the sea in leisure and have seldom exerted myself, but it is my pleasure to aid others in need.—Sea Gazer, to his thaumaturge friend, "Moment of Life or Death" video description
Sea Gazer owned the Fantastic Compass, a magical device used to seal away evil monsters. He eventually became friends with a thaumaturge and gave him the device to aid him in battle, working together to exorcise demons with the compass.[1]
Sea Gazer was very close with Mountain Shaper while he was alive.[2]

Story[]
Little is known about Sea Gazer's history besides his former ownership of the Fantastic Compass and his friendship with both a mortal and Mountain Shaper. He built his abode in Lisha, which contains "his rarest and most exquisite treasures," including a massive chunk of Sunset Vermillionite.[2]

Legacy[]
As part of their efforts to rebuild the Jade Chamber, Shenhe, the Traveler, and Paimon venture into Sea Gazer's Abode in search of his Sunset Vermillionite. At the end of the domain, the Seelie that the Traveler, Paimon, and Shenhe follow comes to rest alongside another Seelie that has already been settled in its Seelie Court; however, no details are given as to whom the Seelie may represent.[2]
During the Lantern Rite of The Exquisite Night Chimes, the Mingxiao Lantern was modeled after Sea Gazer.[3]
