Dialogue[]
Available after completing Latecoming Homecoming.


Giustino: Giovanni, I've already finished lacquering these instruments.
Giovanni: Good. I didn't think you'd still remember the craft of making instruments after all these years.
Giustino: Haha... I've utterly forgotten the complex process of crafting the peg, but the painting process? Oh, I still remember that.
Giustino: It was the most basic of basics, after all. Father scolded me countless times while I was still an apprentice. Couldn't forget it if I tried.
Giovanni: Hmph. So you do remember how instruments are made. Do you remember what makes a man, though?
Giovanni: ...Forget it. Take a break first. I'll handle the rest of the work — but watch closely, and learn well.
