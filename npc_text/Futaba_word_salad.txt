Dialogue[]

Futaba: Big (‍brobroText for male Traveler/sissisText for female Traveler‍), could you tell me a story?
 What kind of story would you like to hear?
Futaba: Granny always tells me scary stories. I'd like to listen to something different this time! Something to do with gods and legends...
Futaba: Wait, are you saying that the Anemo Archon is a drunkard, and that Geo Archon [sic] never takes Mora along when he goes out? Erm... are you just messing with me?
Futaba: I think I'll just go and listen to Granny's stories.
 Are there any interesting stories about the village?
(After completing Yougou Cleansing)
Futaba: Hmm... Interesting stories... Ah, I've got one! It's said that there are bad things that appear in some scary house around here. I've always wanted to go and it see [sic] for myself.
Futaba: Takeru promised to come with me, but his legs got all wobbly when the house got in sight! What a scaredy-cat!
Futaba: If you ask me, I think there must be Tatarigami living in there! They're the scariest type of ghosts! They mess with people's minds and make them go insane.
Futaba: Why don't I go myself? Erm... I already told you, Tatarigami are super scary! It would make more sense to bring someone with me, it'd be dumb to go alone.
 Goodbye.
Futaba: You can come find me if you ever get bored. Catch ya later!
