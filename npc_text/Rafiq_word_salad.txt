(Daytime)
 Requires reinforcing...

Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Rafiq: Hi, need some commercial ship repairs done?
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

 And you are...
Rafiq: I'm a ship craftsman. I'm responsible for ship repairs and maintenance.
Rafiq: When there's no work to do, I'll carry out new research on such questions as how to expand a ship's cabin capacity without compromising the structural integrity of the hull...
Rafiq: But I'm no researcher after all. I don't have a lot of theoretical knowledge, no means to conduct experiments, and I have no friends who study in Kshahrewar...
Rafiq: I've submitted a request to the Akasha Terminal, but it seems to believe that I know enough already...
Rafiq: With regards to my daily work alone, it is indeed enough. But I really want to make some new breakthroughs...
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

 You are...
Rafiq: I'm the ship's craftsman. I'm responsible for ship repairs and maintenance.
Rafiq: When there's no work to do, I'll carry out new research on such questions as how to expand a ship's cabin capacity without compromising the structural integrity of its hull...
Rafiq: But in the end, I'm no researcher. I don't have a lot of theoretical knowledge, no means to conduct experiments, and I have no friends who study in Kshahrewar, and now that Akasha has been shut down...
Rafiq: But Qishan says that this may not be a bad thing. Now that the Akasha Terminals are gone, she says, everyone is free to obtain whatever knowledge they desire.
Rafiq: And you know what? I think she's got a point there!
 Not at the moment.
Rafiq: Okay. Come find me if you do.

Nighttime[]

Rafiq: If only we could find a way to increase the cabin capacity...
Qishan: Wouldn't that affect the ship's hull though?
Qishan: At least, simply changing the material wouldn't cut it.
Rafiq: But based on my calculations, if this cabin here could be opened up to the one next door...
Rafiq: But you said that wouldn't work, so maybe it really isn't possible...
Rafiq: Speaking of which, does everyone in Liyue know as much about ships as you do, Qishan?
Qishan: Ahem... Not necessarily.
Qishan: After all, we have people working in all sorts of industries in Liyue.
