Profile[]
Lunja is a member of the Farrokhzadan, a subgroup of The Eremites presumably descended from the legendary Agha Farrokh.[1]
After successfully completing a commission by the Fatui to kill a traitor, the Fatui paid them handsomely for the task. However, Lunja promptly spent all of it on Genius Invokation TCG and was cheated out of the money, leaving her group broke. Fortunately, the Fatui returned to her with another commission, to capture the Aranara and also acquire a Zohrah Mushroom.
One of the Aranara, Aranakin, was trailing Lunja's group, knowing that the "bad sand grains" were up to no good. Due to the Traveler and Paimon having had some affinity with the Aranara, Aranakin asked them to help them fix the forest by acquiring the Zohrah Mushroom. The Traveler would run into Lunja and her group outside a Withering Zone which the mushroom was holding at bay. Knowing they were quite strong, Lunja had Anqa and Isan follow and eliminate them; however, they were injured and forced to retreat. By the time the Traveler returned to pick the mushroom, Lunja and her men had taken it, but the Traveler quickly followed them out and confronted them.
If the Traveler chose to negotiate, Lunja reluctantly gives up the mushroom in return for a payment of 550,000 Mora in the future, although she warns them to sleep with an eye open. If the Traveler chooses not to negotiate, Lunja and her men attack, only to be driven off in the ensuing scuffle.
In Desert of Hadramaveth, Lunja and her group seem to have less luck or fortune. Records from Farrokhzadan Note mention they had their business opportunity being stolen by Azariq of the Tanit tribe. They also encounter some Fatui and lost their trained Eremite-hound to them, with implications that the dog gets closer to one of the Fatui and chooses to ignore Lunja's signal to go back to them. They also find many stone slates from ruins in Hadramaveth and plan to sell them to the Akademiya for Mora. However, after a party where all members of the group got drunk, the stone slates have become shattered fragments upon the floor and they try their best to fix and patch them up.

Etymology[]
While introducing herself as a Farrokhzadan in Starry Night Chapter, Lunja says "technically, I'm a Farrokhdokht." Farrokhdokht means "daughter of Farrokh" and is a compound name comprised of the surname Farrokh and the word dokht (a shortened form of the Farsi word دختر dokhtar, "daughter").
The name Lunja is of algerian berber origin which means Storyteller, It might also be based on the main character of the Algerian novel Lunja and the Ogre by Zohour Wanese.
