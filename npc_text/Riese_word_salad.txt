Dialogue[]

Riese: How do you do? If you are heading up the mountain, please be on your guard.
 What are you doing here?
Riese: I have orders from the Acting Grand Master to stand guard here and warn all citizens not to go up the mountain.
Riese: Just a while back, I had to stop a family of three who wanted to head up the mountain for a camping trip, and some children who were looking to have a snowball fight on the summit.
Riese: Well, I can't blame them for not being more aware — Mondstadt has been a little too peaceful lately, to the point where no one can imagine how bad conditions are on Dragonspine...
 How bad is it up on the mountain?
Riese: Well, you should wear more layers for starters, or you might freeze.
Riese: Quite a few of my colleagues haven't dared to come back after making just one trip here.
Riese: Hmm? You want to know why I don't fear the cold?
Riese: Well, it's because of my indomitable will and my frigidity-proof physique... and the three or four layers that I'm wearing under this armor. Those are keeping me very warm indeed.
 Thanks for the reminder. See you.
Riese: May Barbatos and his wind protect you!
