Dialogue[]

Takeshi: This place is off-limits. No unauthorized access for outlanders.
 You are...
Takeshi: I am a member of the Okuzumeshuu. I only take orders from the Almighty Shogun.
 "Okuzumeshuu"?
Takeshi: Generally speaking, we are the Almighty Shogun's bodyguards.
Takeshi: The reason for our existence is to make sure that the Almighty Shogun will always have a force by her side that she can always trust and deploy.
Takeshi: Loyalty is of utmost importance here.
 Even the Shogun requires protection?
Takeshi: Of course the Almighty Shogun doesn't need people like us for protection. I'm just here to protect the regular folks.
Takeshi: If someone dares to intrude into the forbidden zone, our Almighty Shogun wouldn't care what reasons they have.
 Goodbye.
Takeshi: Yes, depart now.
