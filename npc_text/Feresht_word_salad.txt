 Trust me...

During A Parade of Providence

 I've heard...
Media:VO Feresht A Parade of Providence 01.ogg "I've heard that the prize for the Interdarshan Championship includes a real treasure! *Sigh*, I'd love to get a chance to appraise it..."

Dialogue[]

Feresht: Some day, I'm going to inherit the family business and run it even better than Father!
 Adventure Challenge
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Feresht: So, this looks like a game for the master of treasure appraisal. It's not so simple!
(If the player wins the match)

Feresht: Aww, you won... But that's okay! Just wait until I come up with an even harder challenge!
 And you are...
Feresht: You may call me "Master Treasure Appraiser, Prospective Antiques Collector, and Future Prominent Businessman Feresht."
Feresht: When it comes to appraising treasure and collecting antiques, my sole objective is to surpass Father. Then there will be no one better than me.
Feresht: As for the business side of things, I have two more formidable opponents to defeat...
 Who are these formidable opponents?
Feresht: One is that sly Sulaykha. With that silver tongue of hers, she's able to sell something as cheap as a rug at a high price. I'm not gonna lose to her!
Feresht: The other is that Lord Sangemah Bay often mentioned by Father.
Feresht: I don't know who that is yet, but Father makes it sound like they're someone even more impressive!
Feresht: It doesn't matter. A powerful adversary is all the more worth the challenge. Just wait and see!
 Good luck.
Feresht: Thanks!

Event Dialogue[]
A Parade of Providence[]

Feresht: Greetings. You may call me "Master Treasure Appraiser, Prospective Antiques Collector, and Future Prominent Businessman Feresht."
Feresht: Have you heard? The Akademiya is hosting some kind of celebration along with a competition. Supposedly, the champion's prize is an extremely rare treasure.
Feresht: I think it was called... the diadem of... something. Ah. It doesn't matter. The first trick to being an expert appraiser of treasures is to avoid getting intimidated by a treasure's name!
Feresht: In terms of appraising antique collections, I'm only slightly less refined than my father. If you want to know how much a certain treasure is worth, just bring it to me and I'll let you know after a glance.
