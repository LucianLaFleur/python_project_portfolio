Profile[]
Foltz belonged to a family in Fontaine before he was promptly abandoned due to his sadistic tendencies to choke his family pets to death (which Lyney stated was out of "curiosity"), after which he was taken into the House of the Hearth. 
After meeting the Traveler in Poisson, Arlecchino tasked Foltz with eavesdropping on dissatisfied members who wished to leave, which he did without question and presented his findings when she asked for it. Following the duel against Arlecchino, Foltz offered to help Lyney back to Poisson, and called him a hero for protecting his family.
