Profile[]
Corporal Mashkov is a member of the Ninth Company, originally sent to the Chasm to help deal with a mysterious black sludge in a joint agreement with the Liyue Qixing to combat the darkness underneath. The mission failed as the device the Fatui used exploded and failed to purify anything. This resulted in the company shattering, with men going missing or dying and Mashkov assuming leadership of small group of Fatui.
As they starved due to lack of supplies, they came across fellow Ninth Company member Anton negotiating with the Traveler for food. Mashkov condemned Anton for revealing Fatui secrets and demanded the Traveler hand over their food, but he and his cohorts were weak with hunger and were ultimately defeated and forced to retreat. It's unknown if the group survived or perished deep within the Chasm.

Appearance[]
Mashkov takes on the form of a Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard.

Etymology[]
Mashkov's name may be inspired by Roman Mashkov (Russian: Рома́н Машко́в Román Mashkóv), a commander of a Soviet reconnaissance platoon of the 5th Motor Rifle Brigade of the 5th Tank Corps who fought during World War II. He survived and was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for his actions.
