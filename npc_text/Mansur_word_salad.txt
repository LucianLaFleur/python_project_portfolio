 Trying too hard...
Media:VO Mansur 01.ogg "Hmm... Am I trying too hard?"

Thoughts[]
Mansur's thoughts can be accessed by using Nahida's Elemental Skill, All Schemes to Know.


Media:VO Mansur All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Mansur: (We'd have to close the blacksmith's to treat the air, but if it gets shut down I'll have nothing to write about for my thesis... Ugh, this is so frustrating!)

Dialogue[]

Mansur: I never thought that ironworking would be so much more interesting than writing essays...
 And you are...
Mansur: I'm a researcher from the Akademiya's Amurta, I came to the blacksmith's because I'm being oppre— uh, I mean, I'm doing some research for a paper I'm writing on air pollution.
Mansur: Anyway, I never imagined that I would develop such an interest in ironworking after having a look at it, and I unwittingly became Mr. Ahangar's apprentice...
Mansur: It seems a little too late to back out now. Mr. Ahangar adopted a lot of kids, but they all either became researchers or joined the Eremites.
Mansur: And yet somehow, a researcher like me who worries over their dissertation all day has now become the only heir to his craft...
Mansur: Still, I'm telling you, ironworking is a heck of a lot more fun than writing papers. Not only has my stamina improved, my hair's even stopped falling out.
 What do you plan to do next?
Mansur: Well, at the moment, I'm simultaneously keeping the serious air pollution problem at the blacksmith's from the Akademiya while prolonging my internship here with Mr. Ahangar...
Mansur: Mr. Ahangar looked quite pleased to finally have an apprentice. I can get by well enough on my wages, so I guess I'll just take it one step at a time for now.
 What about the thesis?
Mansur: Oh please...
Mansur: Now take this... as uh, hush money! Please stop asking me about the thesis. I get a headache just hearing it.

 See you.
Mansur: See you.
