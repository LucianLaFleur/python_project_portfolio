Dialogue[]

Safie: Hello! Are you going to Sumeru City? Do you need a bodyguard? I was the one who escorted Gohar into the city!
 I don't need one. Thanks.
Safie: Whoa, you're confident. If you're that strong, why don't you join the Eremites?
Safie: You'll have a pretty good life if you can handle security jobs or escorting cargos.
Safie: I think Brother Aybak is doing it for our safety, but he always gives us jobs that don't require traveling to the city or facing any danger.
Safie: I can't deny that it's easy, but it's so boring! Even window shopping and counting Harra Fruits would be more interesting than those commissions.
 Gohar?
Safie: Oh, sorry. I forgot outsiders don't know about Gohar.
Safie: She is a beautiful lady that everyone here in Caravan Ribat likes. Whoever meets her can't help but say a few words of praise to her.
Safie: It's a pity you can't get to meet her in person. Some weeks ago, she received a letter from a Dusk Bird, then she asked me to send her to Sumeru City.
Safie: It was so much fun...! Um, I mean, it was an unforgettable work experience!
 See you.
Safie: See you. Let me know if you come across any commissions in Sumeru City!
