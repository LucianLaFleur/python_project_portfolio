Herman's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Herman is Ellin's father and a former famous adventurer. Ever since he got married and had a daughter, he has decided to retire from adventuring and focus on his family. He wanted to avoid putting himself in danger and risk leaving his family behind. He even sold his sword, the Cool Steel, as a sign of his commitment to ending his life of adventuring.[1] He is uninterested in sharing his past as he wants to be an ordinary father. While he has succeeded in keeping a low profile, his daughter has never seen any indication that he was an adventurer and does not believe that he ever was one. So, Ellin rejected his offer to supervise her training for the Knights of Favonius tryouts. Herman accepts that he can't prove it, as his responsibilities as a family man are much more important than obtaining proof of a risky profession.[2]
Since his daughter wanted to be a knight and is old enough to join, he wanted to do everything to allow Ellin to fulfill her dream. For her birthday, he wanted to gift her a new sword from the Schulz's Blacksmith but the swords were expensive. He also offered to help Ellin train but he was rejected. As a last effort to help his daughter, he remembered the wooden dummies used by Hilichurls for combat training which he saw during his adventurers. So, he asked the Traveler to collect a wooden dummy. Even if the returns with the dummy in pieces, he still fixed it and gave it to his daughter to train with.[2]

Herman: Wagner's swords are all so expensive... *sigh*
 About Stormterror...
(After completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
Herman: Stormterror? Are you asking me to...
Herman: No, no way. I'm not making a comeback!
Herman: Look at me. I... I already have a wife and a child. I have a daughter now. The adventurer Herman has nothing to do with me anymore!
Herman: My life doesn't belong to me alone any longer. Even if it's for their sake, I won't go on another adventure...
 You are...?
Herman: Who, me? Sorry, you must have the wrong guy; I'm certainly not who you're looking for.
Herman: I'm just an ordinary dad on his way to the shops. See? Ordinary as can be.
 I never said I was looking for you...
Herman: Oh I see, I misunderstood. I thought you were another one of these who'd heard my story and came here to harass me about it.
Herman: Look, whatever stories you've heard about Herman the adventurer, don't believe a word! ...Even the ones that are true.
Herman: Because I'm not the same person anymore. No more starry-eyed "ad astra" adventurer for me; the only thing that catches my eye now is my wife. And no more conquering the abyss — not when I've got a daughter to deal with!
Herman: So long as they are in my life, I don't have the right to tempt fate by going on adventures anymore.
 Who's that person?
Herman: Huh, have you... never heard of the adventurer Herman before?
Herman: ...No, this must be your way provoking me to make a comeback. I've already seen through you!
Herman: It's a shame. As I am now, all I can do is provide younger adventurers like you with snippets of my experience. I don't go out on adventures anymore.
(Obtain  Adventurer's Experience ×7)
 What are you doing?
Herman: My baby girl Ellin is almost old enough to sign up with the Knights of Favonius now. It's what she's always wanted to do...
Herman: I was going to give her a sword for her birthday this year, but it's so expensive...
Herman: Maybe it's true that I've got nothing left going for me now I'm not an adventurer...
Herman: Especially now I've spent the last of the Mora I made when I forced myself to sell my trusty sword, Cool Steel, all those years ago...
 Goodbye.
Herman: Bye. If you come across a good way to make money, let me know. As long as it doesn't involve tempting fate, that is.
