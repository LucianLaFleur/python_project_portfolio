 Sorry...

Event Dialogue[]
Of Ballads and Brews[]

Diane: Sorry, but Diona will be on leave for the duration of the festival... Oh, you're not here to see Diona? That's rare.
 I'd like to sell wine-making ingredients.
Diane: One moment please, let me have a look around for Miss Margaret's acquisition list. Now, where did I put it...
(Open menu for Selling Ingredients)
 Diona and Margaret aren't here?
Diane: Yes, Miss Diona's mood tends to sour when Weinlesefest comes around, so Miss Margaret gave her some time off.
Diane: But that's understandable. After all, the number of booze hounds at the wine market far exceeds that which you might find at the tavern.
Diane: As for Miss Margaret, she certainly wouldn't pass up the festivities just to run the business. She's probably off somewhere drinking and having a good time as we speak.
 Bye.
Diane: See you, happy Weinlesefest!
