Profile[]
He was the owner and manager of the Minghua Company that owns the Minghua Bank. In the mornings, he stares at the bank below the Adventurers' Guild while reminiscing his past glory.
He is the father of Huachu, whom he calls "Chu." However, his daughter faked her death to elope with Jianqiu when he opposed their marriage.[1] His daughter's "death" forced him to sell the bank to the Fatui for her funeral.[2] A copy of his Ad selling the Minghua Bank can be seen at the Feiyun Slope Bulletin Board.

Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Gentry De'an: Ugh, what do you want?
 Who are you...?
Gentry De'an: Typical! Young people these days! Care more about what's on their head than what's inside it...
Gentry De'an: I'll have you know that ten years ago, everyone from Feiyun Slope down to the Dockyard knew the name Gentry De'an!
Gentry De'an: Now? The bank's gone, Chu's gone... It's such a pity! I've lived this long only to watch everything fall apart at the end...
 Do you need a hand?
Gentry De'an: Hmph! (‍HeHeText for male Traveler/SheSheText for female Traveler‍) wants to lend a hand! And just how do you expect to do that? Raise the dead? Magically recover my lost wealth?
Gentry De'an: *sigh* I used to have my own bank... The Minghua Company and the Minghua Bank used to be the two proudest stores on this whole street.
Gentry De'an: But then those bankers from Snezhnaya started descending on the Liyue financial market... All thanks to backing from the Fatui, I might add, not an honest-to-god bootstrapper among them! Anyway... that marked the beginning of the end for the old guard...
Gentry De'an: If I was a young man with some fight left in me, oh you can be sure I'd be fighting to make my comeback...
Gentry De'an: But there's not much an old man like me can do now.
 The Fatui?
Gentry De'an: What about them? ...You've never heard of them?
Gentry De'an: They came over here from Snezhnaya, flaunting their diplomatic immunity, then they started poking around business circles, putting feelers out... I had a bad feeling about them from the start.
Gentry De'an: Then they started interfering with my business... They were intent on getting Snezhnayan investment into Liyue one way or another.
Gentry De'an: They were just relentless. Eventually, I had no choice but to sell off the bank to them. And the company? Who knows how much longer it will last. Business is getting worse by the day...
 See you.
Gentry De'an: Hmph, well I hope I won't see you! Stay out of my sight.

Nighttime[]

Gentry De'an: So many medicines, but no cure for heartache...
 Is something the matter?
Gentry De'an: Hmph... My story has become a byword here in Liyue...
Gentry De'an: Not a while back, I opposed my daughter Huachu's marriage to some beggar boy... and my sweet daughter, she threw herself down a well...
Gentry De'an: Why, oh why, did she have to fall for that indigent, rat-eyed schoolmaster? Ah, alas!
Gentry De'an: She'd rather live a pauper with him than let me arrange her affairs. I said but a few words, and then she... she...
Gentry De'an: How could you be so foolish, Huachu...
Gentry De'an: And you! Are you trying to rub salt in my wounds? Scram! Get lost! Don't bother me!
 See you, then.
Gentry De'an: ...Bye.
Gentry De'an: ...A father burying his daughter...
