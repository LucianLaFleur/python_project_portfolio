Idle Quotes[]

Media:VO Michelle 02.ogg "Shh! Can you hear that? It's the whispers of the wind."

Dialogue[]

Michelle: Even Barbatos needs his rest...
Michelle: Rest is only rest after a day of hard work, otherwise, it's just loafing off.
 About Stormterror...
(After completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
Michelle: Never mind my safety. I just hope that this windmill that my family has protected for generation upon generation will be fine.
Michelle: *sigh* The storm created when the dragon attacked previously was far too strong. I wonder if the windmill has taken damage.
Michelle: I wanted to climb it to have a look, but the Knights stopped me.
Michelle: They said that it was too dangerous because Stormterror could attack again at any moment...
(After completing A Long Shot)
Michelle: Seeing the windmill safe puts my heart at ease.
Michelle: The sound of the windmill spinning in the storm was frightening — it was as if the wind itself was crying out.
Michelle: How wonderful! Thanks to Lord Barbatos' protection, the windmill has returned to normal.
 What are you doing?
Michelle: Hush... I'm receiving the will of Barbatos.
 Tell me about the windmills.
Michelle: The windmills are instrumental in drawing water for Mondstadt.
Michelle: Our family has worked with windmills for generations. This is why I'm well aware of it.
Michelle: Tired of it? Not at all. I'm always full of energy as long as the wind of Barbatos blows.
 Tell me about Barbatos.
Michelle: Barbatos is a benevolent and hard-working archon.
Michelle: I'm sure the wind, or Barbatos, would listen to all of your troubles.
Michelle: However, rely on yourself, not Barbatos, on your own tasks.
Michelle: Only you can solve your own troubles, right?
 Is something troubling you?
Michelle: Yes, actually, but it isn't a serious matter... Well, do you know about Philanemo Mushrooms?
Michelle: These mushrooms just spring up all over the windmill when we're not looking. I've cleaned a portion of it, but there are just too many.
Michelle: I'm racking my brains as to how to go about cleaning at the moment. If you could take a few with you, that would be great.
(Obtain  Philanemo Mushroom ×6)
 Goodbye.
Michelle: Be respectful toward the windmills. Barbatos' wind is all around us.
