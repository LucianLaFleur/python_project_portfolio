Dialogue[]
After completing Courage is in the Heart

Arashakun: As long as Arashakun has "courage," Arashakun won't be scared no matter how many "masked monsters" come! They will never steal "courage" again! Arashakun won't allow that!
 Actually, courage can never be stolen...
Arashakun: ?
Arashakun: But after "courage" was stolen, Arashakun felt weak in hands and feet...
 The courage is rooted in your heart...
Arashakun: Hmm... what Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) said, is hard to understand...
 Yeah, so be careful with it...
Arashakun: Arashakun will!
