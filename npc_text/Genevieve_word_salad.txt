Genevieve is a former member of the Fontaine Research Institute. She ended up in the Fortress of Meropide for striking a colleague, Champvallon, in anger during an academic conference. In the fortress, Genevieve teams with Poiret to play Coupon Millionaire. During Game of the Rich, Genevieve's team gives their points to Rave. But Genevieve and Rave ultimately lose to the Kids team (Traveler, Caterpillar).[1] In Both Brains and Brawn, Poiret and Genevieve team up again to compete in the Pankration tournament and they are coached by the Traveler.[2]
