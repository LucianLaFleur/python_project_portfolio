 Xinyue Kiosk...
Media:VO Yueshu 01.ogg "Xinyue Kiosk, a place to go for classic Yue dishes!"

Dialogue[]

Yueshu: Welcome to the Xinyue Kiosk. May I have the table number of your reservation?
 Can I get food to-go?
Yueshu: Certainly! Please take your pick from the very finest that Yue cuisine has to offer.
(Opens the Xinyue Kiosk Shop menu)
 I haven't booked, can you squeeze me in?
Yueshu: The Xinyue Kiosk is the most popular restaurant in Liyue Harbor for Yue-style cuisine, and we only have a limited number of tables at specific hours of the day...
Yueshu: So unfortunately, we tend to book up around three months ahead of time. This has been the situation for quite some time now.
Yueshu: After all, the Xinyue Kiosk is an enduring favorite among true fans of classic Yue-style seafood.
Yueshu: I'm afraid everyone has to wait their turn, even employees. My husband and our children are still waiting for their lucky day too! Haha...
Yueshu: It's no surprise this place is so popular. It's the most authentic Yue cuisine you will find anywhere.
 See you.
Yueshu: The Xinyue Kiosk looks forward to serving you in future! Three months or so in the future, if you reserve soon...
