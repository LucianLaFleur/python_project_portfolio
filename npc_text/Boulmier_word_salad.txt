Boulmier is part of the Beret Society and Dougier's subordinate. Being one of the more "docile" and obedient members, Boulmier was sent to greet Wriothesley and the Traveler to put on a performance and make the Beret Society look good. Boulmier can be found organizing the books at the Beret Society gathering place. Later it is found out that Boulmier was following a script. When the Traveler confronted her later, Boulmier insisted that the Traveler not look through the books.[1]
