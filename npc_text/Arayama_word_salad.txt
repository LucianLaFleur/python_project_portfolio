Arayama is an historical figure of the Aranara. They, along with Araji and Aramaha, sealed each of the three Ashvattha's Concourses with their own rhythms, and then turned themselves into Vasara Trees. Arayama's Vasara Tree is located at Ardravi Valley.

Story[]
Araji, Aramaha, and Arayama's friendship was comparable to the friendship of the three God-Kings: King Deshret, the Goddess of Flowers, and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.[1] According to Araminali, Arayama used to stick together with Aranimba and Araminali and the three of them were so happy no matter what they did.[2]
Arayama was noted to be not fond of Nara (human), and they used to create the phantasmal barrier to mess up the Nara. One day, one Nara saw though Arayama's Ararakalari, and despite their effort, the Nara easily bypassed any obstacle that Arayama created. Afterward, they became friends.[3] Their rhythm is "Rhythm of the Beastly Trail," which is able to remove illusion and obstacle caused by Claustroflora.[4] Arayama created one such barrier for Araminali in order to protect their "happy nest."[5]
Presumably during the cataclysm, Arayama fought against the Marana. Afterward, they turned into a Vasara Tree inside a sealed Ashvattha's Concourse, and left their song behind as a method to unseal it.[6] Arayama had the idea of using flowers to hide songs, which they, along with Araji and Aramaha, all used.[7]
