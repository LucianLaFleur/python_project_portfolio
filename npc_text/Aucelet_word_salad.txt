Aucelet is part of the Beret Society and Dougier's subordinate. Being one of the more "docile" and obedient members, Aucelet was sent to greet Wriothesley and the Traveler to put on a performance and make the Beret Society look good. Later it is found out that Aucelet was following a script and was being monitored by Dougier through a security camera. When the Traveler confronted Aucelet later, Aucelet was paralyzed, not knowing how to act, fearing that he would be punished for making a wrong move.[1] Later, Aucelet is arrested by Wriothesley's guards for collusion in a scheme in the Beret Society and fraud.[2]
