Story[]
The Skyrider first attempted to fly with his sword in Jueyun Karst, but failed and was nonlethally wounded. He sold the sword in exchange for medicine, but his dreams of flying continued.[1] Instead of accepting that swords would not fly, he blamed the sword, and decided to use a larger greatsword instead. He attempted once more to fly in Guyun Stone Forest, but once again fell, this time perishing in the attempt.[2]

Trivia[]
This is likely based off the common trope in xianxia novels where cultivators can fly on their swords.
Interestingly, there is a Skyrider Greatsword stabbed into a stone platform at Guyun Stone Forest. Perhaps it landed there after his leap, though the positioning seems a bit too intentional for it to have just randomly fallen there.
Pan Guan'er finds a Skyrider Sword in Jueyun Karst. It's unclear if this is the one that the Skyrider sold, if it is from another attempt, or if this weapon is simply mass-produced and not unique to the Skyrider.
