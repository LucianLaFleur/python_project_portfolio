Little is known about Skybracer's history as an adeptus, but his antlers — his pride and joy — were a gift from Morax himself and were made from the essence of Morax's divine power, making them the hardest substance in all of Liyue.
During a certain battle in the Archon War, an opposing god slashed Mt. Tianheng, causing it to start collapsing on the village at the foot of the mountain. To save the villagers, Skybracer had an adeptus friend chop his antlers off and use them as a wedge to prop up the mountain, causing it to rise far higher than its original height. Even as blood gushed out of his head, Skybracer continued to do battle until he finally succumbed to his wounds. The blood he lost then became the Bishui River.[2][3]
