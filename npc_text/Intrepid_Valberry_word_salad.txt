Dialogue[]

"Intrepid Valberry": Uh... Huh? My eyes aren't playing tricks on me, are they? Since I can actually see you here... Have you also broken the law?
 I haven't done anything wrong.
"Intrepid Valberry": Ha! Done nothing wrong... I know you young'uns all like to save face.
"Intrepid Valberry": Eh, forget it. I won't ask. Though it seems we're somewhat bound together by fate, so if anyone gives you any trouble, you come tell me, and I'll help you out.
 How's life in the Fortress of Meropide?
"Intrepid Valberry": Do you really need to ask that? You'll know for yourself in a couple days, right?
 What orange Bulle Fruit?
"Intrepid Valberry": I used to have a buddy who really liked Bulle Fruit, and recently I saw that someone had drawn one on the noticeboard. It made me miss him all of a sudden.
"Intrepid Valberry": Never mind. Poor guy's probably long since left this world. Forget it. Remember to treasure those around you, eh?
 Bye.
"Intrepid Valberry": Don't be as arrogant here as you are out there. That's my advice.
