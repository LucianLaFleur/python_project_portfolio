Dialogue[]

(Before completing Transient Dreams)
Kouichi: Midori, Midori. Let's talk about the Outside World again!
Midori: Hehe, again? Really now...
Midori: Since you're so eager to hear about it, Let me tell you something new then! So, what do you want to know?
Kouichi: What is that place called Liyue on the other side of the ocean like?
Midori: Liyue is super famous for its rocks. You know that too, right?
Midori: But you definitely don't know that those rocks from Liyue are actually little animals. They can run, yell, and jump!
Kouichi: Wow! That's so cool... What about Fontaine?
Midori: The roads of Fontaine are all built in mid-air. The wagons that people ride fly like egrets. It only takes a short while to get from one side of the village to another!
Kouichi: Wow! What... what about Sumeru?
Midori: The Sumeru locals have it more difficult. There are grass all over the ground after all.
Midori: They eat and drink grass. There are no Egg Rolls, no Dango.
Kouichi: Poor Sumeru...
Kouichi: If only I could get out of here. I would probably be on the other side of the sea already...
Kouichi: Ugh, rocky animals, flying wagons, please wait for me...
(After completing Transient Dreams)
Kouichi: Midori, Midori. Let's talk about the Outside World again!
Midori: Well, well! Who do we have here? But since you're so eager to hear about it, Let me tell you something new then! So, what do you want to know?
Kouichi: What is that place called Liyue on the other side of the ocean like?
Midori: Liyue is super famous for its rocks. You know that too, right?

Midori: They eat and drink grass. There are no Egg Rolls, no Dango.
Kouichi: Poor Sumeru...
Kouichi: If it weren't for my parents not letting me, I would probably be on the other side of the sea already...
Kouichi: Ugh, rocky animals, flying wagons, please wait for me...
