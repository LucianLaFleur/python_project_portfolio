(After completing The Strange Tale of Suikou's Tipsy Tincture)
Fukumoto: Welcome, this is the Yae Publishing House stall that sells children's books specifically.
Fukumoto: We've got all manner of youkai tales here in Inazuma, and tales that feature kitsune, tanuki, or tengu as the main characters are very popular indeed. We've even received a significant amount of overseas orders.
