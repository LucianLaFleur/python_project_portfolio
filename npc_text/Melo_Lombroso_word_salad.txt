Story[]
In Melo's childhood, a failed attempt by Mosso Lombroso and the then-Editor-in-Chief of The Steambird to develop "Curve"'s lie-detecting modules through the newspaper caused popular opinion to violently turn against "Curve." To save his invention, Mosso falsified evidence indicating he had tampered with "Curve"'s programming and had the Editor-in-Chief publish articles which exposed him, leading to Mosso's death in the Duelists' Arena.[1]
Melo was not allowed to watch Mosso's duel, but after his death, her father gave her the Old Clockwork Locket gifted by Mosso as a memento. Years later, her then-husband Rocher inadvertently sold this locket to repay the Elegant Tableware Confrerie, who duped him into a multi-level marketing scheme. Unable to admit the truth as to how he lost the locket, he lied and told her that he lost it while gambling. Furious, Melo threw him out of the house and took the losses,[2] leading to her own loss in wealth.
During the Questioning Melusine and Answering Machine questline, Melo becomes a suspect for the identity of "Crow or Blackbird?," who wrote threatening letters to The Steambird regarding the truth behind Mosso's death and stole Sir Arthur as a bargaining chip. Euphrasie exonerates Melo and the Traveler returns the lost locket, having discovered it at the Elegant Tableware Confrerie's hideout during the investigation into Sir Arthur's disappearance. Melo also recognizes "Curve" after he recites Mosso's favorite phrase: "The different ways in which lies can exist," in response to the inscription inside the locket, "Faded under the sunlight, shining under the sunlight." After exposing Melo's photo inside the locket to light, it reveals a map to Mosso's research lab, which Talochard had been hoping to find.
After the Questioning Melusine and Answering Machine questline, Melo can be found next to Rocher's tent.
