Dialogue[]

Hajime: Sorry, I have a lot on my plate right now. I can only talk to you while I work. Would you like to buy a weapon? Or do you have a forging request?

(If nothing has been forged)
 I want you to forge something for me...
Hajime: Bring me the materials, and I will get to work right away.
(If something has been forged but not collected yet)
 I'd like something made.
Hajime: The previous job you asked me to do has been completed. See if it's to your satisfaction or not. By the way, do you have anything else for me?

 I'm looking for a handy weapon.
Hajime: These are all works of the Amenoma Art that have been approved by my master. Take a gander.
 Do you have any information about Inazuman ores?
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Hajime knows; Version 1)

Hajime: Ah, are you asking about locations where you can find our locally-produced ores? Well, I do have some intel. It's just that my work here as an apprentice at Amenoma Smithy keeps me ever so occupied...
Hajime: Speaking of which, my master gave me some Magical Crystal Ore lately. It's quite different from the usual materials I work with, and I'm not as familiar as I could be just yet.
Hajime: Let's do it like this: I'll mark the locations of the Magical Crystal Ores on your map, and you can mine them and have a look. If you figure out a way to work with them, it would be great if you could tell me.
(Rich Ore Reserves marked on the map)
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Hajime knows; Version 2)

Hajime: Ah, are you asking about locations where you can find our locally-produced ores? Well, I do have some intel. It's just that my work here as an apprentice at Amenoma Smithy keeps me ever so occupied...
Hajime: How about this, then? I'll mark these ore locations on your map. Bring them back to me, and I'll see what I can do about them.
(Rich Ore Reserves marked on the map)
(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Hajime knows)

Hajime: I'm sorry, but the nearby veins have all been mined, and I don't have any new information on hand, either. Best you come back again later.
 About yourself...
Hajime: Me? I'm just a regular apprentice swordsmith. I do whatever my master tells me to do.
Hajime: As you can see, I practice forging every day, earn a meager salary, and listen to my master's endless lectures...
Hajime: Although I'm the senior disciple, I'm not sure if the master's really counting on me to take over the Amenoma Art.
Hajime: ...Well, whatever. It's not a bad idea, as long as I get paid more.
 It's tough being a disciple.
Hajime: *sigh* You said it... It'd be bad if my master hears me complaining. If he overhears, he'll lecture me for the entire day.
Hajime: Thank you for your concern. Seeing as you are a Traveler on the move, I'll give these ores to you. If something is wrong with your weapon, they might be of use to you.
(Obtain  Crystal Chunk ×4)
 Goodbye.
Hajime: Okay, I'll see you whenever you've got another job for me.
