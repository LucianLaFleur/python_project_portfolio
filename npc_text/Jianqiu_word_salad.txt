Jianqiu's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Jianqiu was an arithmetic teacher at Chihu Rock.  He now introduces himself as an Assistant Shopkeeper of Minghua Bank.
He is currently accompanying Huachu on a "confidential" business trip—though Gentry De'an's message on the Feiyun Slope Bulletin Board suggests that Huachu has faked her death with Jianqiu's help, with the intent of eloping with her lover.

Dialogue[]

Jianqiu: Hi, what's up?
 Are you traveling?
Jianqiu: I'm going with this young lady on a big once-in-a-lifetime trip.
 Who are you?
Jianqiu: I taught arithmetic at Chihu Rock for a few years, where my students were all kids from poor families.
Jianqiu: Now I work at the Minghua Bank as Assistant Shopkeeper.
Jianqiu: I am accompanying this young lady on her travels to make sure she stays safe.
 Where are you going?
Jianqiu: Dunno, maybe Celestia.
Jianqiu: Heh. Just joking. I'm not supposed to let people know where we're headed, I'm afraid, sorry about that.
 Bon voyage.
Jianqiu: With any luck, it will be. Thanks! Same to you.
