Shurayh was a student at Alkami's training center who replaced Waiz toward the end of the Treasure and True Interest route. Despite not being in the original trio with Uzayr and Tanisha, he appears to be familiar with them and Kaveh, implying that he was one of the 17 other students in Kaveh's class that wasn't initially shown onscreen.
Following the closure of Alkami's training center, he returns to the site with Uzayr and Tanisha to discuss Alkami's exposure as a con artist, explaining that the Matra returned some of their tuition but expressing disappointment that they had wasted so much of their time attending his classes. When Uzayr suggests that Kaveh may return to teach them, as he had previously promised, Shurayh is skeptical that Kaveh would have any reason to stick around, and is the first to react when Kaveh does, informally referring to him as "Kaveh" before Kaveh corrects him to call him "Mr. Kaveh."
At the end of the route, he becomes one of Kaveh's pupils.
