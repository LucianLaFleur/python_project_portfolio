Barbara mentions Dahlia during Rosaria's official introduction as the person who asked for her help to find Rosaria.[1] Similarly, Dahlia is again mentioned in Rosaria's alternate character outfit To the Church's Free Spirit, attributed as the writer of a birthday letter given to Rosaria alongside the outfit.[2]
During the Version 3.1 Flagship Event Of Ballads and Brews, Rosaria had an open-world dialogue mentioning Dahlia. Rosaria stated that she went to Weinlesefest to skip work for the church and was watching out to make sure Dahlia or Victoria wouldn't find her and drag her to join the sung poetry event.[3]
