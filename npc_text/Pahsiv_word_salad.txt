Location[]
Pahsiv's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Pahsiv is a "fairy" that looks after and protects Erinnyes Forest. She uses a limited amount of words, most notably "pahsiv" for "yes" and "Melusine" for no. She is not aware of other Melusines, Merusea Village or the Court of Fontaine.
During the events of The Wild Fairy of Erinnyes, the Traveler and Paimon encounter her by chance when solving a puzzle in the Erinnyes Forest. The two deduce that she was trying to restore the Weeping Willow of the Lake, which had been defiled by a Root-Consuming Tumor and a riftwolf nest. They assisted her in purging the defilement; when the riftwolves attacked, she fled, though upon seeing that they restored the tree's help, she returned with several chests to reward them for their efforts.

Appearance[]
Her color scheme resembles a Primordial Bathysmal Vishap — her skin and hair are dark blue and eyes are pink with vertical pupils, unlike in other Melusines.

Trivia[]
Pahsiv is likely to be a Vishap in disguise:
Her given name, when reversed, spells out "vishap." Her skin and clothing share a similar color hue as a Bathysmal Vishap.
Like the Vassals of Watatsumi/Reptilians, Pahsiv has snake-like eyes with vertical pupils. Additionally, her eyes are the same color as a Primordial Bathysmal Vishap.
Pahsiv is also able to calm down a Primordial Bathysmal Vishap.
While the Traveler is fighting Rifthounds at the Roots of Erinnyes in the World Quest Within the Depths of Erinnyes in Series The Wild Fairy of Erinnyes, Pahsiv disappears and a vishap appears to assist the Traveler with fighting the Rifthounds.
