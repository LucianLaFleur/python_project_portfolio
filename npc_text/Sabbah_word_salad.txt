Dialogue[]

(After completing The Exile: Blooming)
Sabbah: Here for a chat? I've been wanting to talk to somebody.
 This is a Sumeru Rose that I picked.
(If this option has not been selected)
(Submit  Sumeru Rose)
Sabbah: How I miss this sight... Here, your presents are ready too. Please, take them.
Sabbah: They're all seeds of plants that won't grow here. If you have a yard somewhere else, you can watch them mature there.
(Obtain  Harra Fruit Seed ×3,  Zaytun Peach Seed ×3 and  Sumeru Rose Seed ×3)
 Which Darshan were you with, by the way?
Sabbah: Oh, I could talk for three whole days about that!
Sabbah: I was with Amurta and specialized in plant evolution, so you could say my work was evidence-based.
Sabbah: That means it is impossible to reach new conclusions without new forms of evidence. Simply put, fossils are necessary for the study of historical plants.
Sabbah: But there are only so many fossil samples available, and the Akademiya is limited in its ability to provide new ones.
Sabbah: Those were the circumstances, yet the institute still demanded results.
Sabbah: So some people would just take a previous study, revise or add something to it, and turn it in. You also find that quite pointless, right?
Sabbah: In truth, we could make new discoveries for sure if we looked towards history and geography for new materials.
Sabbah: Certain literary documents that Amurta would usually ignore could be used as well, though that would surely cross into Vahumana and Haravatat territory.
Sabbah: I was not proficient in those fields, and requesting the related files was too troublesome, never mind working with their researchers...
Sabbah: But I believe that if we could actually work together as a team, many questions of the past would finally be answered.
Sabbah: It's a shame that we couldn't continue our collaboration attempts. I must say that people in Vahumana and Haravatat have very peculiar perspectives, though...
Sabbah: I had to be very careful with my wording and phrasing in my submissions to them to avoid misunderstandings and misinterpretations.
Sabbah: Before I was kicked out of the Akademiya, I was still in the middle of an argument with someone from Haravatat. Now I can't even do that...
 How's life in Aaru Village?
Sabbah: It's alright. I have food and a roof over my head. All the essential things in life are taken care of.
Sabbah: I was banished, after all, so I can't dream of having books and research instruments here.
Sabbah: This place has been used as exiled scholars' banishing grounds for quite a while. Life is hard and practical here, so naturally, no one here is interested in academics or research.
Sabbah: I'm certainly not the first exile, and probably won't be the last.
Sabbah: All I can do is to learn to live with it.
Sabbah: Ah, I just rambled for a long time... But it feels good.
Sabbah: Before you got here, I really didn't have many friends, and it could get pretty lonely.
Sabbah: Very few people in the village are into gardening.
Sabbah: ...Well, that's not entirely true. An old man living to the north of the village also plowed a plot to grow flowers.
Sabbah: I've visited him before. He's a slightly eccentric old man.
Sabbah: I saw him planting stones, but he insisted that they were flowers, and even kicked me out.
Sabbah: It must be lonely, living all by himself. I can understand that.
Sabbah: You helped me with my Sumeru Roses... Maybe you can help him with his plants too.
Sabbah: You and Paimon should visit him if you get a chance.

(After completing A Gifted Rose)
Sabbah: The Sumeru Roses we planted and the Golden Roses in Affan's nursery have both been growing nicely. Thank you so very much.
 Which Darshan were you in, by the way?
Sabbah: Oh, I could talk for three whole days about that!

 How's life in Aaru Village?
Sabbah: Oh, I've been doing alright. Thanks for your concern.
Sabbah: The neighbors have been very kind to me, and Affan swings around to chat often, so... I'm definitely a lot less lonely than I was before.
Sabbah: Though I fear that I can't just get books or research equipment whenever I want, I believe that as long as I desire to seek knowledge, I shall find it, no matter where I am.
 Have a great day.
Sabbah: You too. Safe travels.
