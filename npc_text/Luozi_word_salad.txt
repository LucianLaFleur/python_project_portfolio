Dialogue[]

Luozi: The King of Invokations Grand Prix sure has attracted a lot of people...
Luozi: Hey there, Traveler. Are you here to take part in the Grand Prix as well?
 About Zero Hour Invokation...
Luozi: Oh, you're interested in trying this out? Sure, you can build your deck over here.
Luozi: You'll be playing against Hong'yu. Good luck!
Luozi: I never expected Zero Hour Invokation to be so popular... Hmm, I think I'm sensing some business opportunities...
Luozi: Ahem! Please build your deck here and let me know if you need any help.
Hong'yu accepted your challenge, and has come to the table...

 About the mechanical paintings...
Luozi: Mechanical paintings? Oh, you mean those paintings you can freely take apart and reassemble?

Luozi: If you're interested, you can give them a try right away.
 I've got other things to do right now...
Luozi: Alright. I'll be at this booth throughout the Grand Prix event period.
Luozi: If you have any questions, just come ask me directly.
