Madarame Hyakubei: Hello, what is your business in the Yashiro Commission?
(Reputation Level 3)
Madarame Hyakubei: It's you. Welcome back. The Yashiro Commission has received a lot of requests recently. Could you take a look at them?
(Reputation Level 7)
Madarame Hyakubei: Hello, it's been a while! Every time you come, it means that a lot of our headaches will soon disappear. Thank you very much for that.
 How's my reputation in Inazuma?
(Reputation Level 1-2)
Madarame Hyakubei: About that... if you could help finish some work here, everyone in Inazuma would really appreciate it.
(Reputation Level 3)
Madarame Hyakubei: You have helped a lot of people through your work! We'll be counting on you in the future as well. Much obliged.
(Reputation Level 7)
Madarame Hyakubei: You do good work! It's no wonder you are a trusted friend of Miss Kamisato. I'd wager these tasks are just small beans to you.
(Opens Inazuma Reputation menu)
 About yourself...
Madarame Hyakubei: I am Madarame Hyakubei, an advisor who reports to Commissioner Kamisato of the Yashiro Commission.
Madarame Hyakubei: The Commissioner is very busy at the moment, so you may talk to me if it is not something urgent.
Madarame Hyakubei: Feel free to ask for help if you need anything. You are a respected guest of the Kamisato Clan, and I shall do my utmost to help you.
 About the Yashiro Commission...
Madarame Hyakubei: The Yashiro Commission, the Kanjou Commission, and the Tenryou Commission are known as the "Tri-Commission." The Yashiro Commission is different from the other two commissions. It's responsible for cultural affairs in Inazuma, like offerings to shrines, ceremonial affairs, publishing books, and so on.
Madarame Hyakubei: Because of that, we often hear the various wishes of the people of Inazuma...
Madarame Hyakubei: Miss Kamisato is a very kind lady. She has persuaded the Commissioner to allocate funds and resources to help grant the peoples' wishes.
Madarame Hyakubei: But since the requests concern many different aspects of life here, we usually have a shortage of manpower when things get busy...
Madarame Hyakubei: Now that I mention it, would you be interested in helping us out? You will be paid fairly, of course. Once you have more experienced and a better reputation, you will receive more important and better-paying commissions.
 I won't disturb you then.
Madarame Hyakubei: Okay, on your way, then.
