In an optional segment of the World Quest The Ocean Pearl, Cui'er gives the the Traveler a letter to deliver to Chaoxi. However, when the Traveler arrives, Chaoxi is talking up Sisi and pretends the letter is from a work associate, and then gives the Traveler his reply to deliver back to her.
After completing The Ocean Pearl, Cui'er will stand on the deck of the Pearl Galley waiting for Chaoxi, unaware that he has been telling her tall tales to attract her attention, and has no intention of making good on his promise to take her away.

Cui'er: How do you do, honored guest? Forgive me for being indisposed to serve you at the moment. I am... waiting for someone.
 Waiting?
Cui'er: I am waiting for my lover. His name is Chaoxi, and he is a brilliant sailor.
Cui'er: Mr. Chao always tells stories of his adventures. The last time, he talked about a duel with a giant sea creature, and before that, he told us about the time he destroyed a pirate crew by himself...
Cui'er: His stories truly are spellbinding. I only wish I were there to experience those magnificent events alongside him...
Cui'er: Regardless, we have made a pact, that when next we meet, he will take me away from here...
Cui'er: Though waiting like this is torment, my heart is already set on him, and so I will continue waiting...
 Goodbye, and good luck.
Cui'er: Please, enjoy yourself to the fullest.
