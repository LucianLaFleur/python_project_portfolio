Profile[]
Mizri is one of the leaders in Ayn Al-Ahmar, an Eremite group that shuns Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and favors King Deshret. He and his men learned that a Divine Knowledge Capsule had been lost and was recently seen in Port Ormos. They were competing against Alhaitham, who was also looking for the capsule to study it. After insulting Tariq due to him conning scholars out of their Mora, Tariq arranged a fight between him and the brigade.
Alhaitham brought the Traveler along to assist in the battle after learning they could manipulate elemental energy. Prior to the fight, Mizri also acquired the capsule and took it just as his men had been defeated by the two. Having fallen into a state of madness, he nearly beats Tariq up before Alhaitham destroys his Akasha Terminal. The Matra then arrive to apprehend Mizri, who mutters "World... forget me.", the same words the Traveler heard from the Irminsul tree when they arrived at Sumeru.

Appearance[]
Mizri takes on the appearance of an Eremite Linebreaker.
