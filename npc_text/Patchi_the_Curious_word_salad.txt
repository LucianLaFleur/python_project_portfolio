Dialogue[]

Patchi the Curious: There must be a better point of entry, there has to be— oh, sorry. Hello, traveler.
 What's happened?
Patchi the Curious: I am a researcher of ancient ruins. I simply have to find a way to get inside and investigate... But how in the world is one supposed to get past a Ruin Guard?
Patchi the Curious: My acquaintance Doolan, an adventurer, was once injured by a Ruin Guard when he, too, sought to venture inside these ruins. We are discussing how to approach it.
Patchi the Curious: *sigh* But after hours and hours of discussion, we have made no progress whatsoever...
 Are you running into some difficulties?
Patchi the Curious: Yes... In the interests of his safety, Mr. Doolan seems to think that there is no such thing as being what I would call overcautious.
Patchi the Curious: Sometimes the discovery to be made is so valuable that it merits taking on a certain amount of risk... but he sees that view as just an excuse for being rash and impulsive.
Patchi the Curious: Neither of us will be persuaded by the other, and he also keeps interrupting me... *sigh*
 He seems like a bit of a shady character.
Patchi the Curious: Oh, I wouldn't go that far... Sure, he's not with the Adventurers' Guild, but he's an adventurer all the same.
Patchi the Curious: He has much more adventuring experience than me, and as a result he can discern the risks far better than I in many scenarios.
Patchi the Curious: I just think it's a bit difficult communicating with him; sometimes I barely understand what's coming out of his mouth... Maybe I'm just being too rigid and inflexible?
 About your research?
Patchi the Curious: Why do I research ancient ruins? Out of curiosity, naturally! Surely you find the tantalizing traces of history inside irresistible too?
Patchi the Curious: Reading The Mondstadt Tower was what first got me interested in history.
Patchi the Curious: Everyone describes it as a historical romance, but... Personally, I didn't see what was so romantic about it when I read it.
Patchi the Curious: If you've never read it, you should take this copy. Seriously, it's a good read.
(Obtain  The Mondstadt Tower (I))
 Goodbye.
Patchi the Curious: Okay, bye. I'll keep mulling this over...

Event Dialogue[]
Invitation of Windblume[]

Patchi the Curious: What sort of flower is a "Windblume"? The one who solves this particular enigma will certainly leave their mark on the academic world.
Patchi the Curious: And that's why some researchers have teamed up with adventurers to search for clues as to the "Windblume"'s identity.
Patchi the Curious: Unfortunately, they haven't made much headway.
Patchi the Curious: But we don't give up! We will find that true "Windblume." That is our solemn duty as researchers!
Patchi the Curious: Speaking of which, Mr. Doolan often tells me that we should go to Cape Oath to have a look. What a curious idea. It's not as if there are ruins there or anything...

Windblume's Breath[]

Patchi the Curious: So, just what kind of flower was the Windblume from Old Mondstadt?
Patchi the Curious: Modern Mondstadters have every opinion in the world about Windblumes, but they all seem to lack the desire to seek out tangible proof.
Patchi the Curious: It might be that the atmosphere of the festival is too leisurely. I'm seeing wandering couples play at being adventurers without properly understanding what a real adventure is.
Patchi the Curious: Hmph, I'm not like them. As a true scholar, I want to discover the truth behind the question, and won't be deterred by anything else!
Patchi the Curious: Speaking of which, Mr. Doolan often tells me that we should go to Cape Oath to have a look. What a curious idea. It's not as if there are ruins there or anything...
