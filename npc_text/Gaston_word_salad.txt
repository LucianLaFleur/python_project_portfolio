Dialogue[]

Gaston: I must ask these questions once that "Lord" of theirs returns...
 What are you doing?
Gaston: I traveled all the way here from Fontaine just to interview the owner of this place.
Gaston: I inquired about it everywhere, while people are constantly praising the architect who designed this place, no one knows who owns it.
Gaston: Isn't that an obvious scoop for me!?
Gaston: I may be just be a trainee reporter from The Steambird, but I can't let that stop me. If I want to write an intriguing article, then I must be the first to eat the Specter!
Gaston: So no matter how hard it is, I'm going to meet the owner of this place!
 Persistence is the key!
Gaston: You're right!
Gaston: That's what my teacher taught me: A journalist needs to have an adventurous spirit to make my news report the biggest blast!
(Obtain  Adventurer's Experience ×4)
 See you.
Gaston: You're leaving already? Bye then. I'll be waiting a while longer.
