Uncle Ghast's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Uncle Ghast's moniker comes from the village children, from the fact that he is never without a ghost story to tell. He carries many a tale of ghost stories, and somehow even has hold of Dusky Ming's story.

Appearance[]
Uncle Ghast is an elderly man with a slim build and midnight eyes. He wears a straw hat and has a goatee. He wears gray capri pants with triangular dark gray tidings near the bottom, paired by low dark brown shoes. His dark teal tang suit is accompanied by an open dark brown vest, held together by a hazel belt.

Dialogue[]

Uncle Ghast: Ho there, youngster.
 And you are...?
Uncle Ghast: Hehe, the brats in the village call me Uncle Ghast, for I am never without a ghost story to tell.
Uncle Ghast: Well, would you like to hear a story too? Well then, ground yourself well, lest a single scare sets your legs to trembling!
 Sure.
Uncle Ghast: There was once a young lass called Dusky Ming, a cute and precocious girl, but one whose luck was poor. She suffered from a terrible illness, and died young.
Uncle Ghast: Her mother washed her face with tears, and would not leave the house, for the blow was too much for her to bear.
Uncle Ghast: But one day, there was a knock, knock, knock at their door. Frightened, her mother carefully pushed the door open...
Uncle Ghast: ...and when she looked, there was a piping hot bowl of meat soup and a plate of cooked meat, but not a soul in sight. Not comprehending this, Dusky Ming's mother followed the trail of that wonderful aroma...
Uncle Ghast: Only to stumble right into a hilichurl camp. Quickly, they surrounded her, and oh, how her eyes grew wide with fright.
Uncle Ghast: But the moment passed, and all she heard was the chanting of "Dada... Dada..." The mother opened her eyes as quickly as she dared, and what did she see?
Uncle Ghast: The hilichurls dancing, dancing Dusky Ming's favorite dance!
Uncle Ghast: Just then, she felt something bump into her from behind, and though she could see no one, she could smell a familiar fragrance.
Uncle Ghast: Tears rolled down the mother's face, for then she knew that her Dusky Ming was not lonely in the afterlife, no indeed — she had instead made herself many an adorable friend...
 I feel rather moved instead...
Uncle Ghast: What are  you babbling about? Dusky Ming is a ghost — is that not enough to frighten folk?
Uncle Ghast: How does your mind even tick...
 That was a little scary.
Uncle Ghast: Hehe... This is the ghost story I am most proud of, after all. It has never failed me yet!
Uncle Ghast: Most important of all, this story is as real as real can be.
 I'll pass...
Uncle Ghast: Hmph. And here I thought you would have a little more guts than those brats.
Uncle Ghast: Well, it's alright, it's alright.
 See you.
Uncle Ghast: As you please, youngster. If you ever want to hear another story, come and find me any time.

Event Dialogue[]
Unreconciled Stars[]

Uncle Ghast: Oh? Come and have a chat, kid. Who knows — if the influence of those meteorites gets any stronger, there'll be no one to talk to but in your dreams. *chuckles*

Trivia[]
Uncle Ghast wrote an advertisement for Ms. Bai's Almond Tofu on the Qingce Village Bulletin Board because her handwriting was apparently too bad. However, nearing the end, he put his own spin on it, turning it into a ghost story. A note was added afterwards telling him not to promote his own ghost stories because he would scare away the guests.
