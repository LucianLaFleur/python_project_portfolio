 Narukami Island's path...
Media:VO Kobayashi 01.ogg "Narukami Island is up ahead. You cannot pass without a permit."

After completing Transient Dreams

 So much easier...
Media:VO Kobayashi 02.ogg *sigh* "This job's so much easier now that I don't have to check everyone's travel permits."

During Hues of the Violet Garden

 So lively!
Media:VO Kobayashi Irodori 01.ogg "Yae Publishing House really came through with this one. This festival is so lively!"

Dialogue[]

(Before completing Transient Dreams)
Kobayashi: Hmm? What is it?
 Where does this road lead?
Kobayashi: There's a place called Konda Village up ahead.
Kobayashi: ...Walk along the main road after leaving the village and you will find yourself near Inazuma City.
Kobayashi: Oh right. Do you have the permit to enter and leave Ritou?
 Permit?
Kobayashi: I'm referring to the Travel Permit. It is a document issued by the Tenryou Commission or the Kanjou Commission that allows you to travel freely within Inazuma.
Kobayashi: ...You don't actually have one, do you?
Kobayashi: If you don't have one, just stay in Ritou.
 Travel Permit... do you mean this? (Available after obtaining the Travel Permit during Chisato's Letter)
Kobayashi: Let me see... Yeah, that's the one. You are good then. You may pass here.
 Goodbye...
Kobayashi: Hey! You can't run around without a permit!
(After completing Transient Dreams)
Kobayashi: Hmm? What is it?
 Where does this road lead?
Kobayashi: There's a place called Konda Village up ahead.
Kobayashi: ...Walk along the main road after leaving the village and you will find yourself near Inazuma City.
Kobayashi: Oh, yes. You don't have any contraband items on your person, right?
 Contraband items?
Kobayashi Um, like... compasses that automatically search for treasure, bottles that allow you to fly, or boats armed with large cannons...and things like that?
Kobayashi I mean, I'm just guessing, really. I'm honestly not sure what counts as contraband.
Kobayashi And I mean, even if some dangerous does get through, they'll have to face the might of the Tenryou Commission when they're in the city!
 See you...
Kobayashi You take care now.

Event Dialogue[]
Hues of the Violet Garden[]

Kobayashi: Hello, are you here to take part in the festival?
Kobayashi: Ritou hasn't been this lively in ages, and we've got outlanders of all kinds walking the streets as well.
Kobayashi: I'm going to go have a walk once I finish work. My luck's been pretty good so far, so who knows? I might just snag the grand prize.
