Dialogue[]

Ottnit: Hello! Are you looking for Sigewinne? I'm afraid she's not here right now.
 Are you one of the inmates here too?
Ottnit: Mm? No, I'm not! Though a Melusine who committed a crime would be punished the same as a human, it so happens that I am an innocent citizen.
Ottnit: In fact, it's practically the opposite! I'm a member of the Marechaussee Phantom. But it's my day off, so I've come here to speak with a friend, that's all.
 So you're a friend of the head nurse?
Ottnit: Yeah. And here infirmary is quite spacious, it's perfect for us to get together and chat over milkshakes.
Ottnit: Sigewinne's vision is much closer to humans than most Melusines. We all like to hear her describe the surroundings, and then draw them.
Ottnit: ...But as we're still in the Fortress of Meropide we have to keep things low-key.
Ottnit: The terrain here is quite complex, but that's ideal for us smaller types to move about without anyone noticing.
 Very impressive.
Ottnit: Hoho, Since your praise is well deserved, I'm very happy to accept it.
Ottnit: Why don't I return the favor? I found this while I was swimming nearby. Pretty isn't it?
(Obtain  Lumitoile ×4)
 I'll come back later then.
Ottnit: Okay.
