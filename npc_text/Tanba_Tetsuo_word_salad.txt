Story[]
Little is known about Tetsuo's life or history. However, it can be assumed that he was part of the Iwakura Clan while Iwakura Mitsunari was its clan successor. When the Vision Hunt Decree was enacted, Mitsunari had his Vision taken and decided to join the Shogunate forces.[1] Many of the other clan members saw this as a betrayal of their clan's pursuit of righteousness and deserted him, choosing to fight against the Shogunate or falling into banditry. Based on his dialogue, Tetsuo fell into the latter camp.
When the Traveler encounters him, Tetsuo attempts to kill them out of bloodlust. The Traveler is left with no choice but to kill him in self-defense. After receiving word that a Traveler has been going around killing Iwakura Clan members, two expelled members, Okazaki Toraemon and Yanagiha Arashi, find his corpse and collect his sword to create a memorial at Byakko Plain.[2][3]
