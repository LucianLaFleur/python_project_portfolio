Dialogue[]

(Prior to completing Bookworm Swordsman)
Sturdy Wu: Huh? What're you doin'?
(After completing Bookworm Swordsman)
Sturdy Wu: Oh? You again?
 Ahh, hello? Where are we right now?
(Before completing Bookworm Swordsman)
Sturdy Wu: Don't recognize this place? This is Gentry Maocai's residence. He's an ore mogul.
Sturdy Wu: If you haven't made an appointment, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. He's not seeing people right now.
(After completing Bookworm Swordsman)
Sturdy Wu: This is Gentry Maocai's residence. He's a big trader in the gem industry.
Sturdy Wu: Though apparently not long ago there was a leak in some sensitive business information, and as a result he ended up getting overcharged by someone from the Feiyun Commerce Guild.
Sturdy Wu: Who could be so careless as to let out such influential information?
 Why do you look like you're up to something...?
Sturdy Wu: W-What're [sic] you talking about?
Sturdy Wu: I just guard the door. I know nothing.
Sturdy Wu: Even if I did occasionally overhear business secrets, there's no way I'd go leaking information to people. Don't go spreading baseless rumors...
 Right... We'll be going now.
Sturdy Wu: Yes, go. Go!
