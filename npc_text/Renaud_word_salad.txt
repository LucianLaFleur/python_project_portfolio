Dialogue[]

Renaud: If I'm to be honest, you're a lot sturdier than I imagined...
Rodamonte: Assess as you wish. I don't care.
Renaud: ...Your rationality is most admirable, too. It is something I lack. But I can't help but worry about you — it must be hard, being unable to speak to those around you.
Rodamonte: I do not wish for their understanding. This is the price of keeping a secret.
Rodamonte: Also, are you done beating around the bush? Let's get to the meat of the matter. I'm busy.
Renaud: The meat of the matter... Um...
Renaud: So, uh, have you found anything else lately?
Rodamonte: You want it all?
Renaud: Well, of course I'd like to see them, too. I mean, I trust your decision-making, right?
Rodamonte: How did this become my decision? The key is your view. What do you say?
Renaud: Um, what should I say...

Trivia[]
Renaud and Rodamonte are both named after characters from Orlando Innamorato and Orlando Furioso, two major works in the medieval literary cycle of the Matter of France. Renaud is named after Renaud de Montauban, a knight in service to Charlemagne.
