Dialogue[]

Okazaki Erika: Have a seat, and let me know if you want anything.
 So, how did you meet the owner?
Okazaki Erika: You're asking about us? Well, that's a tough question. It's a long story with a side of karma, that's for sure.
Okazaki Erika: When I was still young, I was ordered to monitor an important figure at the Tenryou Commission. Somehow...
Okazaki Erika: *sigh* Forget it. I can only thank the archons that this person eventually retired, and we could finally get married after that. Thank the archons, indeed!
 See you.
Okazaki Erika: Hope you ate well. Come back soon!
