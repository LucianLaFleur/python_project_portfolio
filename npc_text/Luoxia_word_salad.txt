Dialogue[]

Luoxia: Welcome to the Pearl Galley. I believe that I have the honor of addressing the rumored Traveler, yes?
Luoxia: I wonder, whose invitation are you here on?
 What is this place?
Luoxia: This is the Pearl Galley, where you can forget all your worries and troubles...
Luoxia: Do not be alarmed. Everything that happens here has the tacit approval of the Liyue Qixing.
Luoxia: As long as you are here, you can enjoy to your heart's content... *giggles*
 Who might you be?
Luoxia: This one's humble name is Luoxia. I handle... many things onboard this ship. But do not misunderstand. I am not the master here.
Luoxia: Our boss is Rouran. There are very, very few who have the privilege of meeting the boss...
Luoxia: If I may say one more thing... If you do indeed meet our boss, do be mindful of your actions.
Luoxia: Our boss may seem like a delicate flower, but you will find few thorns to match in all of Liyue Harbor.
Luoxia: I will say no more, but do bear what I have said in mind.
 I'll be taking my leave.
Luoxia: As you please... and may you be happy.
