Location[]
Masseira's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Masseira was an elder of the Tanit tribe. Per Babel's order to eliminate other elders, Jeht assassinated most of the elders, except Masseira. His name was on Jeht's hit list, but due to reasons unknown, he was spared and continued to serve the Tanit until the event of the World Quest Series The Dirge of Bilqis.
Masseira had a daughter named Tadhla who he was training to become one of the tribe's Falcons. When she failed to return from a trip, Masseira asked the Traveler to find her, eventually discovering her captured by the Fatui. He was disappointed in his daughter's inability to focus, but nonetheless continued with her coming-of-age ceremony by hunting three Consecrated Beasts across the desert.
After the beasts were hunted down and prepared, Masseira ordered Tadhla to hunt the Traveler at the ruins of Gurabad. When the Traveler defeated her, they returned to the tribe grounds to confront Masseira, but he had already left, having anticipated that she would fail in her task. In a letter he left behind in his tent, he told the Traveler that he was already in a safehouse in the valley and not to blame Tadhla for her own decision, ending with a warning that the hunt was not over and it was just beginning.
According to the event recorded in Nameless Researcher's Notes, which presumably happened after the end of the tribe, Masseira fled to Gavireh Lajavard and got into conflict with members of the Order of Skeptics located there, but managed to escape them alive. Jeht and her newfound mercenary group were on a quest to hunt Masseira down.

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before meeting Masseira in Wisdom Has Built Her House, She Has Hewn Out Her Seven Pillars.


Masseira: The winds will inevitably sweep the dust and sands aside, but from what may we find the power to invoke the presence of wind itself...
 Wind?
Masseira: Hmm... To regard an outlander such as you...
Masseira: Never mind. Cast it from your thoughts. Mellifluous though the voice of the canary may be, how, yet, can a mere melodious voice rupture the webs of affection.
 I don't understand what you're trying to say...
Masseira: Then, stranger, perhaps you should regard my words as but passing wind.
 See you around.
Masseira: Farewell, stranger... May your path be barren of sandstorms.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after meeting Babel in Wisdom Has Built Her House, She Has Hewn Out Her Seven Pillars.


Masseira: Spoken to Babel, have you? Ah, she's probably busying herself somewhere else again... You would sooner stop the wind than stop her.
Masseira: Haha... You know, youngster, speaking of the wind... I'd like to remind you of a kind of desert wind that we call "Zibri."
Masseira: At first, you won't sense anything, until the sandstorm rises over the horizon, and the air itself begins to ascend and burn. Only then will you realize...
Masseira: ...That you can no longer smell anything, for the heated air has smothered your sense of smell, seared your nostrils...
Masseira: By then... Heh. By then, it will be too late.
 I'm afraid I didn't catch your drift...
Masseira: It's nothing... I just mean to say that you should be careful of the sandstorms.

Dialogue Set #3[]
Available after meeting Liloupar in The Temple Where Sand Flows Like Tears.


Masseira: Hehe, so it's you... Youngster, I have heard that you and Jeht went into the accursed city. Ah, and you would like to know how I know this, yes?
Masseira: Hunters have falcons and hounds to be their eyes and ears, naturally. But young one, I must remind you that this word, this "curse," comes not out of thin air.
Masseira: A venom, the root of all tragedy, that drives all humans add [sic], is hidden within a facade of flowing gold.
Masseira: Perhaps it shall be so this time as well, that greedy prey shall fall into a trap, where they cannot be saved...

Dialogue Set #4[]
Available after completing Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part I.‍[verification needed]


Masseira: "Flap, flap, flap," and the little canary returns! Hehe! Congratulations!
 What?
Masseira: Look at you! Look. At. You. The little canary got the poisonous scorpion all tied around itself without even knowing what happened... Amazing! Truly amazing!
 I'm no canary.
Masseira: Oh, and are you a little falcon, then? Hah, but you must overcome my falcon first for that to be the case!
Masseira: But... that little wildcat, like you, is so very ignorant of the great net she has found herself in, relying only on intuition and instinct to struggle and strain...
Masseira: "Ripping, tearing..." Will she sink deeper, I wonder?
 What are you even saying?
Masseira: Oh, oh! I have aroused your anger, I see!
Masseira: Haha. It is nothing... Please, take care of her, for she is a good child.

Dialogue Set #5[]
Available after completing Step 13 of Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part III.


Masseira: How utterly stupid. The tiger pulled out her fangs and smoothed her teeth just to welcome a bride.
Masseira: Now that the tiger is just one step away from her goal, she just gives up everything else — The tail? Useless! The ears? What are they for!?
Masseira: But remember, "If not handled well, your scimitar's blade could be turned against yourself." Hmph, I'm not talking about you, golden canary. I speak of...
Masseira: You'd better watch out for your friend Jeht. Take care of her, hide her fangs, and smooth her raised hackles.

Dialogue Set #6[]
Available after completing The Eternal Dream, Ever Lush.


Masseira: Ah, if isn't our esteemed guest...
Masseira: Color me impressed! What you did was a feat for the ages.
Masseira: Perhaps one day, should I ask for your help, I hope that you'll still be willing to offer it.
 Sure, but shall we play a round of cards first?
Masseira: Cards? With you? It will be my pleasure.
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
 I'll give you a hand when the time comes.
Masseira: Then I thank you in advance.

Dialogue Set #7[]
Available after completing Tadhla the Falcon.


Masseira: Ah, the distinguished Master of the Jinni. If you are here for Tadhla, it might not be a convenient time.
 About Tadhla...
Masseira: I am her Father, she is my Falcon. Although she is not the only Falcon that has grown up under my tutelage, she is the one I trust the most.
Masseira: Trust is invaluable. It is something that concerns life and death in this tribe.
 About you...
Masseira: I am a hunter in the tribe, but I'm getting old and not as strong and agile as before... In time, your friend Jeht will take the place of old timers like me.
Masseira: So, I have high hopes for Tadhla. When the day comes that I have to retire, I need to have at least one Falcon that I can trust.
 About the tribe...
Masseira: Tanit is our tribe, our home.
Masseira: In the desert, no one can survive without the protection of the tribe. Also, if the tribe needs to take someone's life, how can they escape under the omnipresence of the "eyes" and "claws" of our Falcons?
 Bye.
Masseira: May patterns on the sand dunes guide your way, esteemed Master of the Jinni.

Dialogue Set #8[]
Available after completing "The Falcon's Hunt".


Masseira: Ah, if isn't the esteemed Master of the Jinni. What can I do for you?
 About Tadhla...
Masseira: She likes you, I can see that.
Masseira: Don't worry, I'll leave her be. To be young... Right?
Masseira: I'll encourage her to express her feelings. As her elder and father, this is a duty to which I am bound. There's no need for you to worry about her. Truly.
 About the "coming-of-age ceremony"...
Masseira: Thank you for helping her complete her coming-of-age ceremony. I was right to trust you.
Masseira: Next, she will accept her first hunting mission as a qualified Falcon.
Masseira: By then, hehe, please witness her growth in person.
