I decided that if my research could not help them, and was only good for publishing reports, then it would not be worth very much at all.—Hosseini, Spike Self-Circulation Report: Conclusion (Part 1)
Hosseini hails from Vimara Village and is a member of Spantamad, the school which specializes in researching ley lines. As part of his thesis, and in his supervisor's interest, he went to collect a perfectly preserved Irminsul Fruit discovered by Liyue's Adventurers' Guild. While transporting it, however, they were ambushed by Treasure Hoarders and the fruit exploded into multiple fragments, much to Hosseini's chagrin and Yingzhu's subsequent annoyance. Fortunately, the Traveler arrived and helped reclaim the fragments from the monsters that had taken interest in them before taking them to a Domain with an Energy Amplifier to gather data.
Afterwards, Hosseini and the Traveler have stumbled upon each other on multiple occasions through Hosseini's commissions to the Adventurers' Guild. Hosseini has displayed a particular interest in utilizing ancient technology, including the Energy Amplifier and Pursina's Spikes, lamenting how the latter was left to gather dust in the Akademiya's warehouses. He also idolizes great inventor-researchers like the Pursina who invented the Spikes and Ayesha, the inventor of Ayesha's Chaos Prospector.

Appearance[]
Despite being under 30 years old, Hosseini has the appearance of a middle-aged man. His hair has turned near-gray as a result from the stress of trying to complete and submit his papers for approval.

Story[]
Hosseini is a Driyosh, or traveling scholar, in Spantamad who has met various troubles in completing his thesis and graduating. In the past, he was greatly aided by the House of Purbiruni, which is why he later takes up a commission from Khedive, a member of the school of Purbiruni, who was researching changes in The Chasm.[1]
Hosseini was researching Irminsul Fruit for his thesis, which was also a major area of interest for his supervisor. Sumeru Akademiya commissioned the Liyue Adventurers' Guild to explore a ruin, where they found a perfectly preserved Irminsul Fruit. Hosseini spent a great fortune to travel to Liyue and retrieve the Fruit, only for the plan to unravel when a Treasure Hoarder ambush caused the Fruit to explode into fragments — a possibility neither he nor the Adventurers' Guild was aware of. The Traveler managed to partially salvage his project by collecting the fragments and gathering data on the Energy Amplifier by utilizing those fragments inside a Domain.[2]

Journey to Inazuma[]
Despite the Traveler's best efforts in retrieving the fragments, the damage to the Irminsul Fruit meant Hosseini could no longer pursue that angle for his thesis.[2] He traveled to Inazuma hoping to research Tsurumi Island's weather conditions, only to run into the Kanjou Commission's exorbitant Residency Permit requirements. Using some "contacts" — smugglers — he managed to venture to Tsurumi, but was unable to make any headway due to his lack of knowledge on how to navigate the fog. Before returning to Ritou, he caught a glimpse of the Anomalous Model Ruin Grader in a spot unaffected by fog and posted a commission to investigate it. However, the adventurer who took up his commission discovered its regenerative properties and, flustered by the experience, dropped the commission without explaining the situation. Hosseini's commission was left unaddressed until the Traveler took it up. Upon learning about the Ruin Grader's strange properties, Hosseini suggested using Pursina's Spikes, an ancient device with the ability to disrupt ley lines, which he had requested some of his countrymen to send him shortly beforehand. Because of the rough voyage, as well as Inazuma's environment, Pursina's Spikes had to be repaired by using Ayesha's Chaos Prospector in other ancient ruins to find the parts needed for Pursina's Spike.[3]
After much effort, the Traveler managed to gather all the parts to repair Pursina's Spike. Hosseini also made some adjustments to the device to make it suitable for Inazuma's environment, although this meant requiring a constant source of Electro energy for the Spikes to function.[4] After performing several tests, the Traveler was able to use the device to successfully take down the Ruin Grader for good. Unfortunately, the Traveler also completely obliterated the machine in the process, leaving nothing for Hosseini to perform research on.[5]

Return to Liyue[]
With little research funds remaining, Hosseini returned to Liyue by catching a trip with The Crux to focus his research on the Energy Amplifier, which had previously been acknowledged by the Akademiya. En route, however, he fell overboard and caught a cold. When the Traveler encounters him, they fail to recognize him, much to his consternation. Nevertheless, they take up his request to venture into Domains with the Energy Amplifier and record the results of their battles.[6]
At Khedive's request, Hosseini went to The Chasm to investigate the sudden, uncontrollable spread of Dark Mud while Khedive posted a commission about it with Liyue's Adventurers' Guild. Due to the dangers involved, nobody was willing to take up the commission before the Traveler's arrival. Katheryne directed them to Hosseini, who was chagrined to find that the Traveler and Paimon once again did not recognize him. Hosseini informed them of his plan to utilize Pursina's Spike again to disrupt the ley lines' ability to access external elements, which would theoretically stop the source of the Dark Mud.[7] However, his failure to account for the different environment — hard rock instead of soft soil — instead caused the Dark Mud to proliferate even more and affect monsters that were not standing in the Mud. After making the appropriate adjustments, Hosseini had Hu and Tao, who volunteered to help with his operation, move Pursina's Spike into the mining complex.[8]
Hosseini explained to the Traveler that Pursina's Spike was designed to handle the sorts of issues they were currently facing; the Spike could seal the ley lines causing the Dark Mud's proliferation while operating by absorbing the energy within the Dark Mud, which also reduced the Mud's contaminant properties. Restating his awe for Pursina's talents, Hosseini mused that his research could give him more insight into Pursina's ability to manipulate ley lines using the devices they invented, going as far as to wish to win the Akademiya's Pir Kavikavus Prize for his research.[4]
After running into Dark Mud that made progression into The Chasm impossible, Hosseini chides Tu's foolhardy insistence on pressing forward, quoting the Sumeru Akademiya axiom of "Your own life is of utmost importance" and ordering Hao and Tu to rest at the camp while he and the Traveler cleared out the Dark Mud.[9] However, while pondering how to best deal with the issue of transporting the Spike, Hosseini came into contact with the Dark Mud himself and experienced a severe negative reaction to it. As a result, he had Hao and Tu package the Spike into a container, which would be transported further into the mine with hot air balloons.[10] In the end, the Traveler successfully activates the Spike within the depths of The Chasm, drawing the issue to a close. Hosseini vows to mention the Traveler in his full report to the Akademiya regarding their insight into Pursina's Spike.[1]

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(During Energy Amplifier Initiation)
Hosseini: What a terrible, terrible situation... Progress on my thesis will completely grind to a  halt..
 What's wrong?
Hosseini: Can you believe it? One minute, a priceless research material is almost within my grasp... the next, it's exploded, and that's that.
Hosseini: My sole purpose in coming all this way to Liyue was to retrieve this Irminsul Fruit. What a waste of a trip!
Hosseini: How could that happen?
 Sounds like you've been dealt quite a tough hand.
Hosseini: *sigh* I don't even know if I'll be able to get my travel expenses reimbursed by this point. Getting here from the Akademiya was exorbitantly expensive.
Hosseini: The Irminsul Fruit is more than just my thesis topic. It's a major area of interest for my supervisor... Ahem, I mean, for the Akademiya.
Hosseini: So as well as delaying my research, it also means I've failed to complete my assignment. It's all a great big mess.
 How come you still haven't graduated?
Hosseini: ...What do you mean, "still"? I'm not even 30 yet. I'm hardly an exceptional case.
Hosseini: And anyway, even graduating after the age of 30 is not so uncommon at the Akademiya.
Hosseini: ...Quit staring at my hair! This is the price one must pay for the pursuit of wisdom!
 Goodbye.
Hosseini: Yes, it's "Goodbye, thesis" for me... *sigh* Never mind.

Dialogue Set #2[]

(During Shadow of the Ancients)
Hosseini: This round of fieldwork has really been a headache...
 Hello.
Hosseini: ...Hello there. Odd to see you not busy for once. Have you come to chat?
Hosseini: I've been in a bit of a rush recently, so I've barely had the chance to get a few lines in.
Hosseini: Really, it's quite a surprise meeting you here in Ritou. Well, strictly speaking, maybe not. We are all outlanders in the Inazumans' eyes, after all.
Hosseini: Before they get a Residence Permit, all outlanders must remain in Ritou. All that considered, I suppose meeting you here isn't so much of a surprise after all.
Hosseini: In any case, I'm still waiting for the Outlander Affairs Agency to review and approve my application for a Residence Permit, so I can't leave at the moment.
Hosseini: I have been waiting for a while now, though. I wonder when the approval will come down.
Hosseini: Each day spent here is another day's worth of expenses expended and research left undone. Most frustrating indeed...
Hosseini: So far, I've only been able to ask someone to help me find some "ways and means" to go to other Inazuman islands and conduct some preliminary research.
Hosseini: What about you? Since you've been able to go to Tsurumi Island, I suppose that your Residence Permit has been processed, right?
Hosseini: Might you have ideas as to how to speed that up, by the way?
 I took a backdoor, actually.
Hosseini: Ah, to think that you'd have such connections. Well, for someone like me who lacks them, even getting that permit done is quite the strenuous effort.
Hosseini: Since you had a contact, I suppose that the Outlander Affairs Agency didn't charge you a processing fee either, then?
Hosseini: When I went to get my documents processed, I specially mentioned that I was a registered researcher with the Akademiya, to be distinguished, of course, from folklorists or other such academic hobbyists.
Hosseini: Only then did the inspector waive some of the fees. Even so, this is a rather troubling process...
 "Ways and means"?
Hosseini: Huh, it seems that you're not aware.
Hosseini: Well, since we're partners here, I suppose I could tell you. But don't spread it around, alright?
Hosseini: Now, there's a certain fellow here in Ritou named Harrison. He's an outlander too, just like us, and he has his ways.
Hosseini: If you wish to go somewhere else "on the quiet," you can look for a way near Harrison's store.
Hosseini: That's all I can say. You'll have to find the way yourself.
Hosseini: And don't get caught by the Shogunate's people, alright? And if you do, don't mention me.
Hosseini: I don't have the Mora on me to pay any fines.
 How's your research going?
Hosseini: Smoothly enough, I suppose. Before arriving at Ritou, my previous research topic was "The Practical Uses of the Energy Amplifier."
Hosseini: Although things went wrong and our research sample was destroyed, we were able to rescue the situation by recovering some sample data.
Hosseini: I have you to thank for that save, Traveler.
 It was nothing.
Hosseini: No need to be so humble. I would never have been able to wrangle with those monsters who had stolen those samples.
 I wouldn't call that previous incident easy either.
Hosseini: That is true. Indeed, it was a most close shave, what with the monsters having made off with the fragments of our sample, after all. I doubt that I would've been able to collect any data by myself.
Hosseini: With that data on hand, I reorganized my research into a report that tackled the problem of "how to use the Energy Amplifier to conduct energy conversions."
Hosseini: The Akademiya rated my report quite highly. I believe that they must recognized the academic value of this line of inquiry.
Hosseini: I even daresay that this research has filled in a large gap in our understanding of the Energy Amplifier.
Hosseini: It is of great comfort to me that its value was finally recognized by my seniors in the academic world.
Hosseini: With that under my belt, I can be said to have graduated successfully. I will not stop here, of course.
Hosseini: I've applied to look into a new research topic. I believe that as long as I keep working at it, I will receive the requisite acknowledgment for that work.
Hosseini: One day, I will make Dastur... maybe even Herbad!
Hosseini: And that's why I'm here in Inazuma, of course, to work on this new topic. It's just a shame that I got stranded here on Ritou before I could make any headway...
 Dastur?
Hosseini: Oh, that? It's an honorific we use for researchers. Unfortunately, I do not yet have the qualifications to be a Dastur.
Hosseini: I'm still an ordinary traveling scholar from the Aramati, so I'm often sent out to conduct filed research.
Hosseini: If I make Dastur, then I might be able to stay at the Akademiya more often.
Hosseini: And when that time comes, I might be able to join such luminaries as the great Pursina and the sagacious Ayesha, and bestow my name upon the fruits of my research, to be used by future generations...
 Herbad?
Hosseini: Ah, that is an honorific we use for researchers. Those who earn the name Herbad are knowledgeable beyond the pale, leaders among scholars.
Hosseini: In my department, the number of great talents who study alchemy and the function of the ley lines are many indeed.
Hosseini: By contrast, I am not their equal in talent. Truly, I wonder if I can ascend to such heights within my lifetime...
Hosseini: But if I can, then perhaps I might be able to join such luminaries as the great Pursina and the sagacious Ayesha, and bestow my name upon the fruits of my research, to be used by future generations...
Hosseini: And there will be Hosseini Machines, Hosseini Methods, and Hosseini Formulas used throughout the scholarly realms of Sumeru...
Hosseini: Ah, just thinking about it makes my soul sing!
 All the best, then. See you!
Hosseini: All the best to you too!
Hosseini: Let's just hope this goes smoothly...

Dialogue Set #3[]

(During Energy Amplifier Fruition)
Hosseini: *cough* Once I'm done with this Energy Amplifier affair, I should... *cough*
Hosseini: Head back to the Akademiya as soon as I can... *cough*
 Are you unwell, by any chance?
Hosseini: Oh, it was a small matter... and it's a little embarrassing, really.
Hosseini: I adjusted my research focus several times, which caused me to remain in Inazuma for a time.
Hosseini: On the return trip, I decided to look for a reliable crew to take me across the ocean.
Hosseini: After much effort, I was able to make contact with the Crux Fleet.
Hosseini: The ocean view was truly spectacular. I have taken a few walks down Sumeru's harborfront as well, but I don't actually have much experience traveling on ships themselves.
Hosseini: The vastness of the ocean was even more awe-inspiring than any book could have described. It was truly... *cough* magnificent.
Hosseini: But there was a price to pay for such wanton admiration... That is to say, I fell overboard by mistake, ahaha—*cough*
Hosseini: So let's just say you're the type of person who is prone to seasickness, spending your days on the boat retching and vomiting...
Hosseini: And at the same time, you cannot swim at all, and were only discovered to have gone overboard by the sailors after some time.
Hosseini: Those were my circumstances... *cough*... I came down with a little something as a result.
Hosseini: But it is no matter. Nothing of consequence at all. It's just that I shall likely have to request sick leave when I return to Sumeru.
 Will we meet again at the Akademiya?
Hosseini: Oh? You'd like to enroll at the Akademiya?
Hosseini: Good, good! I can see that you are a true lover of knowledge, intelligent and agile in your thoughts. You certainly have the talent for it! *cough*
Hosseini: You can even use the elements to boot, and are brimming with experience adventuring outdoors. Indeed, I'd say that you'd be a perfect fit for the Spantamad, which primarily studies the elements and the ley lines.
Hosseini: By the way, I'm a member of the Spantamad myself.
Hosseini: Given your skills, of the Six Darshans... I would deem the Haravatat my least recommended option.
Hosseini: The Haravatat spends much time with ancient runes, and its members are as eccentric in speech as they are few in number. I don't think there's much to look forward to there...
Hosseini: So when it comes to picking your own personal research path, I'd recommend the Spantamad over the Haravatat.
Hosseini: *cough* Well, that's assuming that you do manage to enroll in the Akademiya, of course.
 Until next time.
Hosseini: Yes, see you again... *cough*

Map Icon Description[]
Energy Amplifier Initiation[]
Hosseini, a young scholar from Sumeru, has been dispatched by the Akademiya to obtain the Irminsul Fruit, a highly-valuable research material. Unfortunately, the Fruit has been damaged. To minimize the academic losses, he has to collect data from the Irminsul Fruit's fragments. In despair, Hosseini has resorted to his other research subject, the Energy Amplifier. This ancient relic can direct and enhance energy, and should it be damaged... he'll probably never be able to graduate.

Energy Amplifier Fruition[]
The young scholar Hosseini from Sumeru has returned from his traveling studies in Inazuma, intending to go back to the Akademiya via land route through Liyue. Unfortunately, he did not discover enough to satisfy the Akademiya while in Inazuma, and no amount of passionate academic ideals can save you if you continue failing to meet its exacting standards.As such, the fretful Hosseini is doing all he can to save his academic career. Be bold, young man!
