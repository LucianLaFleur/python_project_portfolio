Dialogue[]
Dialogue #1[]

(Before completing The Chasm Delvers)
Hao: Are you looking for work around here? If you are, I'd advise that you leave. There's nothing left to mine.
 Then why are you here?
Hao: Me? Well, I don't have any other talents other than mining, and you've got to make Mora somehow, am I right? Heh. Don't worry, I reckon I can still make ends meet this way.
Hao: Still, people like us miners... We aren't an awfully talented lot. We tend to stick to this one path, unlike you adventurers. Going out and seeing the world as you like... If only I could do that.
 Well, there are other people around.
Hao: Oh, you mean Tu? He's just like me. Not a talent in the world apart from mining, and not a lot of connections, either. *sigh* I wish I could be like him, you know? Being lost in his own happy little world like that.
 See you.
Hao: See you!

Dialogue #2[]

(After completing The Chasm Delvers)
Hao: Ah, so you're the rumored Traveler, our hero and savior! Thanks to you, we can finally get back to mining and earning a living.
Hao: I mean, it just feels like I'm missing a little something in my day when Tu's not boasting away somewhere. Nor do I really know what he's been pondering recently, anyway.
 Well, he's not very far off.
Hao: I know. I actually met up with him two days ago. But though we weren't that far from each other, he had his business and I had mine, so we didn't speak much.
Hao: But our manager, Muning, bless his heart, has allowed him to continue doing some odd jobs. If not for that, he'd have nowhere to go.
 Save Mora?
Hao: That's right. Once I save up enough, Tu and I will go to Liyue Harbor to have a look around. The way I see it, he's a pretty good storyteller... Who knows, he might be able to do this for a living at some point.
Hao: Well, as for me, I'm quite used to doing hard labor to earn my Mora, so I wouldn't be too sure about such prospects myself.
 See you.
Hao: See you. Say hi to Tu for me!
