Inaba Kyuuzou's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Inaba Kyuuzou is a man in his thirties,[1] married to Inaba Shizuko and the father of Masa and Matsu. Over a decade ago, he joined the Inazuma Shogunate and became a samurai, dreaming of glory and heroic deeds. However, once war broke out between the Shogunate and the Watatsumi Army, Kyuuzou realized that his enemies were not the monsters in the tales of old; they were ordinary people and even acquaintances. He grew disillusioned with the brutal realities of war, regardless of how "just" or "unjust" they might be, and deserted from the army.[1] However, he continued fighting against vagrants and pirates around Nazuchi Beach, and had taken up residence inside an abandoned Sangonomiya vessel when the Traveler encounters him.[2]
After completing the Archon Quest Chapter II: Act III - Omnipresence Over Mortals, Inaba Shizuko posts Missing Person Posters across Inazuma's bulletin boards in hopes of finding him, presumably to no avail. (The messages appear regardless of whether the player completed Fate of a Fighter, and there is no follow-up for players who have.)

Story[]
Kyuuzou joined the Tenryou Commission around ten years ago, yearning to one day live out the tales he heard about heroes who fought during the cataclysm. However, once war began a year ago with the announcement of the Vision Hunt Decree, he realized that war was far from the glorious tales he listened to in his youth. The rest of his allies died around Yashiori Island, where they had been slaying Nobushi and Kairagi. Rebels, Shogunate troops, and pirates alike were driven out of Yashiori Island by the effects of the Tatarigami after Orobashi fanatics in the Watatsumi Army, with Nathan's guidance,[3] destroyed the Narukami Pillars suppressing the phenomenon.[2] A naval battle at Nazuchi Beach destroyed many ships, and although the Shogunate won,[4] Kyuuzou had by then decided to hole himself up in one of the wrecked Sangonomiya ships instead of returning to the Army.[2]
The leader of a pirate group, Onitaka, tasked his crewmates with taking care of Chouji before he headed to Sumeru with Chouji's Mother. They planned on taking Chouji into their group after killing Kyuuzou and taking over the wrecked ship,[5] but Kyuuzou proved far stronger than they expected and one of their members was slain. They swore revenge,[6] leading them to continue harassing Inaba. Their mission to take care of Chouji is never fulfilled, and the Traveler independently meets the boy near his home during the World Quest Gazing Three Thousand Miles Away.

Present Day[]
At the start of Fate of a Fighter, the Traveler and Paimon encounter Kyuuzou cornered by pirates and come to his rescue. Despite his wounded pride, Kyuuzou asks them to clear the pirate camp near the beach. Upon their return, they insist on helping him gather medicine for his wounds and provide him with some Naku Weeds. By this point, he feels a level of camaraderie with them and encourages them to return later. His attitude towards the Traveler began to become friendlier, and he expressed a desire for the Traveler to come back and chat with him after some time.[2]
During their next encounter, Kyuuzou calls his survival a "pity" and informs the Traveler that he would not return to the Tenryou Commission out of fear of Kujou Takayuki, who pushed for the capture and punishment of deserters. However, as a soldier, he also could not sit idly by until peace was restored, either. After remarking that if he died, he would die without regrets, he informs the Traveler of an Inazuman tradition to offer a Dendrobium flower on the graves of fallen samurai, and remarks that he should pay his fallen comrades a visit himself.
In their next encounter, Kyuuzou makes a bet with the Traveler to clear out the nearby pirate camps. The Traveler returns to find Kyuuzou gone and in his place, a letter titled "Inaba Tousaburou Kyuuzou's Final Words," expressing Kyuuzou's clear intent to die. They go to the site mentioned in the letter, where they find a sword mound and three Kairagi: Dancing Thunder at a campsite. Defeating the Kairagi yields the Wonders of the World achievement Oh, the Humanity!, with the description "Witness the fate of the Samurai."[2] The sword mound likely represents Kyuuzou's grave, and Kyuuzou may have either willingly died at the Kairagi's hands or committed ritual seppuku with them as witnesses. It is also possible that the Kairagi were unrelated to Kyuuzou's death and were either trying to loot or defile the grave, given his enmity with the vagrants in life.

Idle Quotes[]

(While giving the Naku Weeds in Fate of a Fighter)
 Yes, thank you.

Trivia[]
Kyuuzou's fallen comrades may be the same ones at the graves visited during the Hidden Exploration Objective "Pay Your Respects," in which the Traveler places Dendrobium Flowers at grave markers scattered across Yashiori Island. However, "Pay Your Respects" does not have Fate of a Fighter as a prerequisite, leaving this connection unconfirmed.
While the quest description for the last part of Fate of a Fighter says "Go to the location designated by the final testament," no location is actually mentioned in his letter.
