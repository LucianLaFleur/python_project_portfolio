 Tell me a little about yourself, please...
Ms. Yu: My name's Ms. Yu, and I'm a resource manager with the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Ms. Yu: By resource management, we don't just mean the management of material goods. We also manage information and human resources.
Ms. Yu: I trust that you, too, understand how important resource management is to a city that prizes commerce as much as Liyue does.
