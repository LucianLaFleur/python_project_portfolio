Dialogue[]

Payne: Take a seat! Today, the drinks are on me!
 About Stormterror...
(After completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
Payne: What? Stormterror? Whatever are you talking about? Hahaha, that's a real good joke, that is! Haha!
Payne: ...
Payne: *sigh* It seems as though my self-hypnosis isn't working...
Payne: Well, if I'm drunk enough, I won't have to think about such things. Boss, another ten mugs over here!
 Never mind...
Payne: Don't be shy, come on... Children of Barbatos are one big family...
Payne: No, wait a second — You're an outlander? Or an imp?
Payne: *sigh* Such a shame.. I was too drunk to see you clearly just now.
 Goodbye...
Payne: Bartender! One more!
