Dialogue[]

Little Zuo: Excuse me, have you seen my frog?
 What frog?
Little Zuo: I just caught a frog, and his back was really slippy, and then I let him get away by accident.
Little Zuo: He's a lively little froggie, I was lucky to catch him the first time...
 What do you want the frog for?
Little Zuo: I wanna give him to my little sister to play with.
Little Zuo: My sister is that girl over there, the one who is always trying to catch her shadow... even though you can't catch your shadow. I don't get why she likes to do that...
Little Zuo: Maybe she just feels bored. At least if I catch her a frog, cashing him will be more fun than chasing her shadow.
 Why don't you play with her?
Little Zuo: I think she doesn't like me very much. She doesn't wanna listen to anything I say, let alone play with me.
Little Zuo: I don't get it, I'm always trying my bestest to find her things she wants, so why won't she be happy with me?
 Best of luck to you.
Little Zuo: Thank you! Frogs are super hard to catch, though...
Little Zuo: So far all I've managed to grab is a few lizards, and even then only the tails...
Little Zuo: Maybe you could take them? I've gotta keep trying to catch a frog, and I definitely can't do it with my hands full of lizard tails.
(Obtain  Lizard Tail ×3)
 Goodbye.
Little Zuo: Byeee!

Event Dialogue[]
Fleeting Colors in Flight[]

Little Zuo: Those two weirdos are up to it again...
Little Zuo: I often see them coming here to read, but I never expected to encounter them during Lantern Rite as well.
Little Zuo: All I hear them talking about is "evil spirits" or somesuch, though. Are they writing a story, by any chance?
