Profile[]
Callirhoe is a Fontainian who took part in the Neighboring Nations Congenial Poetry Gala. Her true identity is an Oceanid who settled in Springvale, after the death of the previous Hydro Archon Egeria.[5]
She once befriended Old Finch and Diona in their childhoods, but has since stopped speaking to them due to the differences between Oceanid and human lifespans.[5] Through some unknown means, she had the power to bless Diona with the ability to make delicious drinks, regardless of the ingredients.[6]

Appearance[]
In her human form, Callirhoe has watery-blue hair and eyes and wears Fontaine-style clothes in a matching color.

Story[]
According to Springvale's legends, the Spring Fairy saved a mother and her sick son by filling the barren hole with water and forming a spring, whose waters miraculously healed the child. Rumors of the healing spring water drew people to the area and a settlement grew around it, becoming known as Springvale.[6]
In another legend, as told in the book Heart of Clear Springs, the Spring Fairy was initially powerless after arriving in Springvale, having lost much of her former wisdom. She was slowly regaining her power when a weeping boy made a wish at the spring. Although she could not grant his wish, she believed that she could share his burdens. He shared stories about his life with her, and she eventually gained the ability to tell him about Fontaine and her own memories that she had recovered. The boy fell in love with her, only for the Spring Fairy to realize that the differences in their lifespans would mean she would live far longer than he would. Afraid of the inevitable parting and the pain of loss it would bring, she left him a parting kiss and thereafter refused to meet him again in spite of her own loneliness. The boy, however, continued to believe in the Spring Fairy up to his dying day.[7][8]
The actual story is close to the legend, except that Callirhoe never kissed Finch before saying farewell, and also that Finch has not yet died and has still continued to wait for her at the spring.[9]

Present Day[]
Old Finch, the man whose tale Heart of Clear Springs is based on,[9] continued to wait for Callirhoe even into old age, and became known as one of the few people in Springvale who continue to believe in her existence.[10][11]
During Diona's childhood, she would occasionally visit Springvale's waters and bare her feelings and loneliness to the spring. Callirhoe listened to Diona and came to pity her, and decided to reveal herself to her on Diona's seventh birthday, giving Diona a blessing that would make all her drinks taste delicious no matter what. Afterwards, she never showed herself again, and Diona came to believe that the Spring Fairy she saw was just a dream.[6]
During the events of Wishful Drops, the young Oceanid Endora ended up in Mondstadt while pursuing the target of her admiration, Rhodeia of Loch. Rhodeia, believing that Endora was an assassin from Fontaine, tried to destroy Endora instead. This caused the waters flowing into Mondstadt to become extremely bitter, with the sole exception of Springvale. To investigate this matter, the Traveler, Paimon, and Endora travel to the village and talk to Old Finch. Endora revealed that she sensed Callirhoe's presence, but received no response to her questions.[11] After Endora developed enough to properly communicate, they revisited the spring. Endora finally received a message from Callirhoe for Old Finch and relays the message imploring him to move on with his life.[5]
Later, during the events of Waterborne Poetry, Callirhoe gained enough magical energy to temporarily assume a human form. Inspired by the Neighboring Nations Congenial Poetry Gala, Calliroe participated in the Gala and wrote poems on leaves, leaving them to drift in the Bishui River. Some of the leaves were caught by Traveler and friends, and they subsequently found Callirhoe surrounded by monsters, upon which she reverted to Water Droplet form. She explained to the Traveler, Paimon, Diona, Chongyun, and Mika that she was an Oceanid of Springvale, and confirmed with Diona that she had not been a dream and was the one to bless her. After the encouragement of Mika and Diona, she finally chose to meet Finch again after many years and returned her feelings for him. To help ease his loneliness, Callirhoe gave him a condensed droplet of her water so that she could be with him in spirit and revealed that she had not forgotten about Diona either with her gift. Before her form expired, she gave Finch a kiss to fulfill the promise they had made back then.[9] Even after losing her physical form, Callirhoe and Old Finch continue to communicate.[10]

Trivia[]
Under the effects of Elemental Sight, she is indicated to be affected by Hydro, like Idyia.
The "Holy Water" that Hopkins the Marvelous retrieves from her spring has the ability to restore 1 HP every second for 20 seconds, but it's unclear whether some of the Spring Fairy's power has seeped into the water or if it is a property of ordinary water.
Callirhoe is mentioned in the description of the following Furnishing: Heart of Clear Springs
Etymology[]
In Greek mythology, Callirhoe (Greek: Καλλιρρόη "beautiful flow") is, amongst other so-named characters, one of the fifty Oceanids.
