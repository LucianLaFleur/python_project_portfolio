 Ah, I got fooled...
Media:VO Jones 01.ogg "Ugh, I got lied to. Why is this job so hard?"

After completing Transient Dreams

 Never again...
Media:VO Jones 02.ogg "Ugh, I'm never going back to Inazuma, not for a million Mora!"

Dialogue[]

(Before completing Transient Dreams)
Jones: Darn it. If I knew that this was the case, I wouldn't have taken this job...
 What's with the long face?
Jones: I'm regretting getting duped into coming to Inazuma.
Jones: I was making a living by doing some menial labor at Dornman Port before this. And then I ran into people from the Kanjou Commission who were recruiting sailors.
Jones: Their supervisor told me that it wouldn't be a tiring gig and that it paid well. I could even travel to Inazuma!
Jones: Because of the lockdown now, regular people can't come to Inazuma at all. Only cargo ships affiliated with the Kanjou Commission may pass through.
Jones: I figured that it might be a good job since I could visit the outside world and make some money. That's why I boarded the ship with them.
Jones: Who knew that I would not even have a chance to walk around freely once I got here...
Jones: This job is hard and tiring, and I can't even return to Mondstadt if I don't finish the job here! What kind of crap is this?
 Goodbye.
Jones: Goodbye. *sigh* Maybe I could swim back to Mondstadt... Actually, never mind. I don't think that's a good idea.
(After completing Transient Dreams)
Jones: Thanks to be the Anemo Archon. I swear I'll never leave Mondstadt again...
 Why's that?
Jones: Well, it all goes back to Inazuma.
Jones: I was making a living by doing some menial labor at Dornman Port before all this. And then I ran into people from the Kanjou Commission who were recruiting sailors.
Jones: Their supervisor told me that it wouldn't be a tiring gig and that it paid well. I could even travel to Inazuma!
Jones: Back when we were all locked down, regular people couldn't come to Inazuma at all. Only cargo ships affiliated with the Kanjou Commission could pass through.
Jones: I figured that it might be a good job since I could visit the outside world and make some money. That's why I boarded the ship with them.
Jones: But the moment I got there, I was stuck in Ritou, and had to do all kinds of hard, exhausting labor!
Jones: So you bet you that last Mora the moment the Sakoku Decree was abolished, I was on the first ship back home.
Jones: Thank you, Lord Barbatos, for blowing the winds of freedom toward Inazuma...
 See you.
Jones: Take it from me, friend: Don't go running off to other nations as and when you like!
