Pam: Care to buy some fresh fish? However you cook it, there's no better dish to complement your wine!
 What do you sell here?
Pam: We sell seafood caught fresh every day, so you never have to worry about quality.
(Opens the shop menu)
 And you are...
Pam: I'm a self-employed fishmonger. Running a small business means selling more for less.
Pam: It's all about making the most of local resources.
Pam: Getting fresh seafood and seagrass daily from the sea doesn't just fill our bellies, it keeps my family afloat, too.
Pam: I can live a free life, and it's all thanks to the bounty of the sea.
 See you.
Pam: Take care. Remember to come back if you're ever looking to buy fresh seafood!
