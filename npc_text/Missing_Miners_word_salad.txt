While the miners were working at The Chasm, they were hypnotized by Jiu and led to the Dragon-Queller, where they were forced to dig to break the seal on Azhdaha. Forced to work to the point of exhaustion, Mao, one of the four miners, ran out of the cave near the Dragon-Queller and fainted nearby. Fortunately, the Traveler, Zhongli and Kun Jun found him. After taking him to a tent to rest, they continued onward and immediately discovered the remaining three miners, who attacked them; however, Zhongli protected the group from the miners' attacks until Jiu appeared to forcibly take them to Azhdaha. After Azhdaha was defeated and sealed again, all four workers were brought back safely to Liyue Harbor by Uncle Dai.
