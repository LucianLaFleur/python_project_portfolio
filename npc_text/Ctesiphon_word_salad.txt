 Assigning work...
Media:VO Ctesiphon 01.ogg "Hmm... How is the work assigned in the tea supply chain?"

Dialogue[]

Ctesiphon: From the planting, picking, and processing of tea to transportation and sale... How is the work distributed in such a complex chain of trade?
 Why are you researching all this?
Ctesiphon: Hah! See, now you're asking the right questions.
Ctesiphon: I'm Ctesiphon, a researcher from the Akademiya Vahumana, and I'm currently studying the unique ecosystem of the tea trade in Chenyu Vale.
Ctesiphon: I have to say, the reasoning behind the tea farmers, teahouses, the Communications Office, and other organizations' distribution of work is quite ingenious...
Ctesiphon: To produce crops of the same quality and do so at scale, it's necessary to study the proper division of labor...
 You want to learn how to grow tea too?
Ctesiphon: The important thing isn't the tea itself, but an organizational model capable of mass-producing high-quality cash crops sustainably over long periods.
 I shall take my leave.
Ctesiphon: Ah! It seemed someone wanted to speak to me just now, yet was scared off by what I was muttering about... Are organizational questions that scary?
