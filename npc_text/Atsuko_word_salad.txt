Profile[]
Atsuko is from Inazuma and is the daughter of Yoh and Michiru. From an early age, Atsuko strove to be independent, having learned to cook by the time she was seven or eight years old, and being able to sail out to sea by the time she was a teenager. She helped out at her family's store, and claims to be skilled at delivering goods. After escaping from Inazuma, she planned to find work at the wharf as a sailor and thus travel the world, but has no idea where to even begin looking for that job.
Due to the events related to Rex Lapis, the whole city is shocked, so she thinks that there isn't any place that would be willing to give a job to an outlander. She made advanced preparations for finding work opportunities by asking around, and in response was referred to approach Manager Kuan, Clerk Zhao, and Nervous An. She postponed talking to them due to her unfamiliarity with how locals interact.
Atsuko did not get too far in job seeking when she heard from the Crux's sailors that the Shogun had abolished the Sakoku Decree. She decided to return to Inazuma, where she found many of the policies changed for the better and returned to her parents, who were more than thrilled to see her again. Seeing how they had aged considerably since she last saw them, she decided to remain with them for the time being. She had also learned of the incident regarding a bake-danuki impersonating her and hoped to see it in the future, believing it to be of use to her.

Appearance[]
Atsuko is an adult female with fair skin, brown eyes, and straight, black hair styled in a bob. She wears Inazuman-style garb that is primarily green and black, with sandals that have white socks underneath.

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Home Lies Over the Ocean.


Atsuko: Hello, hello. Oh, ah, I mean, good fortune! I'm still not accustomed to using the local greetings.
 You are...?
Atsuko: Haha, I'm so sorry, my name is Atsuko, it's lovely to meet you.
Atsuko: I've never seen this many outlanders before back in Inazuma.
 Inazuma?
Atsuko: Yes, my home, back on the other side of the ocean.
Atsuko: Though I don't wish to speak ill of my homeland, the pressure back home is just too much.
Atsuko: If you want to leave, you have to go through several stages of application and approval with the Kanjou Commission. Most people never get the chance to see the outside world.
Atsuko: Perhaps the Shogunate really knows best in having such strict control, but the allure of the open sea and the freedom it represents grew inside me until I couldn't take it anymore.
Atsuko: So... One day when I was gazing out to see, something in me just snapped. I just took the nearest vessel I could find and set out to sea.
Atsuko: So if you see anyone wearing clothes similar to mine, they're probably from Inazuma. Please, if you see such a person, you cannot breathe a word of this to them, they cannot know I'm here. Please, I beg of you.
 That's not great, surely...
Atsuko: What's wrong with it? You mean, breaking Inazuman regulations?
Atsuko: I think it depends on the person. Some people are quite content to spend their whole lives within the fences of their farm...
Atsuko: But not me! If there's anything that can fence me in, it's somewhere beyond these lands, beyond the seas, beyond the stars!
Atsuko: If you can't understand the value of freedom, let me be the one to explain it to you!
(Obtain  Guide to Freedom ×1)
 Hi there! You don't seem to be from around here either.
Atsuko: That's right, I'm from Inazuma. It's been a long road getting here.
Atsuko: Facing the crashing waves before me, whilst trying to escape the forces behind me... My raft sank, my money got swept away by the sea...
Atsuko: Was a good thing the locals helped me, otherwise I wouldn't be standing here today. I've decided I want to get a job on a boat and travel all around the world.
 Goodbye.
Atsuko: Okay, stay safe!

Dialogue Set #2[]

Available after completing Home Lies Over the Ocean and before completing Transient Dreams.

Atsuko: Hello, hello. Oh, ah, I mean, good fortune! I'm still not accustomed to using the local greetings.
 About the letter to your family...
Atsuko: Ah, you've delivered it to my parents, have you? Thank you very much. It's a relief to know that they're doing well.
Atsuko: My mother would most likely keep worrying, while my father would try to comfort her while keeping his own worries in his heart...
Atsuko: *sigh* It was only after leaving that I realized how much they must miss. I'm... really sorry for making them worry.
 About your homeland...
Atsuko: Sometimes I miss the sights that I used to see in my home... The tranquil Chinju Forest, the lovely Sacred Sakura... I grew up with them.
Atsuko: But after the Sakoku Decree was implemented, Inazuma really became such an oppressive place. For someone who loves freedom like me, it was simply unbearable.
Atsuko: If we wanted to leave, we'd have to go through several stages of application and approval with the Kanjou Commission. Most people would never get the chance to see the outside world.
Atsuko: Perhaps the Shogunate really knows best in having such strict control, but the allure of the open sea and the freedom it represents grew inside me until I couldn't take it anymore.
Atsuko: That's why I eventually just grabbed the nearest vessel I could find and set out to sea.
Atsuko: The journey was tough, but thanks to the intervention of some locals from Liyue, I now have my freedom!
 Freedom...
Atsuko: Perhaps everyone has a different understanding of and way of pursuing freedom...
Atsuko: Some people are quite content to spend their whole lives within the fences of their farm...
Atsuko: But not me! If there's anything that can fence me in, it's somewhere beyond these lands, beyond the seas, beyond the stars!
Atsuko: Only by breaking through these boundaries and going out into the world can we understand the value of freedom!
(Obtain  Guide to Freedom ×1)
 Goodbye.
Atsuko: Okay, stay safe!

Dialogue Set #3[]
Available after completing Home Lies Over the Ocean and Transient Dreams.


Atsuko: We meet again! It's great to see you here in Inazuma...
 Hello there, Atsuko.
Atsuko: It has been a long time, Traveler.
Atsuko: Previously, we would only meet in Liyue Harbor. I never expected that I would run into you again here.
Atsuko: It seems that you travel between nations quite frequently. That's very impressive.
 Have you heard about that other "you"?
Atsuko: Oh? You mean the one who was staying with my parents at one point?
Atsuko: Um, how should I put it... It's such a strange story...
Atsuko: That said, I'd love to meet "her" if I have the chance.
Atsuko: Who knows, "she" might be able to help me out a bit.
 You've returned home, I see.
Atsuko: I heard from the Crux Fleet's sailors that the Almighty Shogun has abolished the Sakoku Decree.
Atsuko: So I thought to myself, maybe the samurai at the Police Station might give me a pass and let me return home.
Atsuko: So I boarded a ship bound for Inazuma. I found upon my return that many things have changed.
Atsuko: But the biggest change was... Well, my parents had aged a lot. They had been concerned for my safety this whole time...
Atsuko: Still, they were all smiles when they greeted me. That was something that didn't change.
Atsuko: That's why I've decided to stay for a while longer to accompany them.
 Still want to travel the world?
Atsuko: Haha, you remember that? Thanks for the concern.
Atsuko: I'm still serious about that dream. I'm sure you understand me as only a fellow traveler could.
Atsuko: Now that Inazuma's policies have changed so much, going out to travel is no longer such an arduous task... So if a suitable opportunity comes along, I'll continue my journey.
Atsuko: But for now, I'll continue to stay with my parents.
 I wish you the best of luck.
Atsuko: Thanks!
Atsuko: Though this has been quite the bumpy ride, it does not seem so hard while freedom yet stirs in my heart.
Atsuko: I hope that your future journeys will go smoothly as well!
(Obtain  Guide to Freedom ×1)
 See you around.
Atsuko: Goodbye. Safe travels.
