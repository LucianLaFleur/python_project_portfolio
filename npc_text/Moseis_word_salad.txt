Profile[]
Beynuni was a Kshahrewar scholar who was interested in dreams. When he enrolled in the Sumeru Akademiya, he met Emira and the two reciprocated their feelings. However, Emira was afflicted with Eleazar and soon died from complications, causing him to grow depressed. However, he soon began to experiment to create a "hyper-realistic" person through the dreams, using the Akasha System to power his experiments. To further invest in the experiment, he soon uploaded his consciousness into the Akasha. He also had other unwilling test subjects enter his dream under the pretense of treating mental illnesses.
During the events of Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises, Nahida eventually turned the Akasha System off, causing him to become trapped as he had no way to return to his body. Initially in a panic, he then realized he could draw on a person's energy, which he proceeded to do by using his "patients" as energy sources to sustain himself and his dream. This eventually caught the attention of the Traveler and Nahida due to his subjects unintentionally putting themselves in danger during their dreams, during which they managed to locate his dream and confronted him. To protect his experiment, he began to use the dream to summon monsters, but it eventually spiraled out of control when he tried to summon stronger ones, which also "killed" Emira in the dream and transformed her into a Rockfond Rifthound.
After "Emira" was killed, Moseis became depressed and resigned himself to die, but Nahida refused to let him off easily and uploaded his consciousness into a Knowledge Capsule. When she returned to the real world, she and the Traveler discovered his true name and told Sitt to inform the matra of what occurred so he could be punished.
