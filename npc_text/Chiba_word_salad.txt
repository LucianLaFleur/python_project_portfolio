Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
Chiba: Do you need anything?
 What is this place?
Chiba: This is the Outlander Affairs Agency, which is under the jurisdiction of the Kanjou Commissioner.
Chiba: What is it? Are you here to apply to stay in Ritou? Come in, then... and remember to keep your wallet at hand.
 Wallet?
Chiba: Hmph, you'll see when you're in there...
 What if I want to go to Narukami Island...
Chiba: You want to go to Narukami Island? Then it's not just something that can be taken care of with just Mora.
Chiba: Even Inazuma locals must come here for approval if they want to go to Ritou, let alone an outlander such as yourself trying to leave it. You can forget it.
Chiba: Unless you can get a Travel Permit, but it's not something that can be obtained so easily. Even I don't have a way to get it. As for you... good luck to you.
 Goodbye.
Chiba: Yes...

Chiba: What is it? Are you here to apply to stay in Ritou?
 What if I want to go to Narukami Island...
Chiba: You want to go to Narukami Island? You need to apply for a Travel Permit first.
Chiba: You've come at a good time.

Chiba: You've come at just the right time, really. As long as you have the required materials at the ready, it should be much easier to apply than before.
 See you.
