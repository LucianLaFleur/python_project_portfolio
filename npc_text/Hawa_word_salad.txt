Hawa is an open-world NPC located in The Akademiya, Sumeru City, Sumeru at night, where she can be found talking to her older sister Iris. Hawa is a member of Rtawahist, although Iris' daytime dialogue and their conversation at night indicates Hawa specializes in studying the runes of King Deshret's civilization.

Dialogue[]

Iris: Are you sure you've found the correct semantic field for these ancient runes?
Hawa: Of course I'm not sure. I'm only speculating.
Hawa: Besides, I discovered that there are overlapping marks on the ancient runes on this stone wall.
Hawa: So, I have reason to suspect that they may have been carved by people over several generations.
Iris: Well, that complicates things... In my history researches, the meanings of runes like these can differ significantly from era to era.
Iris: When will Father finish his desert expedition again? We should ask him what he thinks when he gets back.
Iris: Or ask Rifaet. Maybe he has some leads.
