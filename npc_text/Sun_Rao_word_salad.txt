Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available at Yilong Wharf.


Sun Rao: Oars made from new bamboo feel better. Would you like to go to Qiaoying Village by raft?
 Ride the bamboo raft to Qiaoying Village
Sun Rao: Please, take your seat and we'll set out.
 Bamboo? Oars?
Sun Rao: Oars are made from new or old bamboo based on each ferryman's preference.
Sun Rao: Strictly speaking, old and new bamboo from Qingce Village have the same strength so long as they're cut at the right time and processed the right way.
Sun Rao: But every ferryman's hands are different, so they make different choices.
Sun Rao: The ferryman who taught me to sing said that it's just like tea, where the same leaves have different flavors after being processed by different tea makers.
Sun Rao: Some of us are accustomed to using oars made out of new bamboo, and some are accustomed to using oars made out of old bamboo. We each have our unique boating rhythm and hum melodies in unique ways...
 Folksong?
Sun Rao: Every boatman in Chenyu Vale will hum songs while sailing, and these songs are passed down to the young from the old.
Sun Rao: Nobody knows who composed these songs many years ago, but they have been subtly engraved into the memories of most locals...
Sun Rao: The line that touched me the most is...
Sun Rao: "Sun and earth from each other divide, the eternal whirlpool that never churns, the beautiful jade concealed within..."
 Not now, maybe next time!
Sun Rao: No worries. There will always be a boatman waiting for you by the river here in Chenyu Vale.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available upon arriving at the Qiaoying Village docks.


Sun Rao: We've arrived at Qiaoying Village. May we meet again, if fate wills it so!

One of the songs is sung in Chinese in all dubs of the game. The lyrics of the song can be pieced together from the two ferrymen's dialogue:
幽谷涟涟泉响圜，灵龛先出东北岸，幽峦岸峻藏西南；乾阳临坤自相隔，长流涡不转，美玉藏其间。 Yōugǔ liánlián quánxiǎng huán, língkān xiān chū dōngběi àn, yōuluán ànjùn cáng xīnán; qián yáng lín kūn zì xiānggé, cháng liú wō bù zhuǎn, měiyù cáng qíjiān.The spring's cries ripple through the vales, the shrines depart from northeast shores. The heights and shallows in the southwest hide, sun and earth from each other divide, the eternal whirlpool that never churns, beautiful jade concealed within.
