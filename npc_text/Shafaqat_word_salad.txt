Story[]
Rose, oh roses, grant me my wish. Blooming from the stone, the Golden Rose sang to me.No land but folk songs bore my spirit. Songs shall defy my fate, and overcome my destiny.They will surpass me, surpass time. They will surpass the ever-lasting withering of life...—Shafaqat's folk song
Shafaqat was a top researcher at Sumeru Akademiya, presumably in the Amurta Darshan due to his cultivation of a new species of flower called the Golden Rose. However, for some reason, he was ultimately exiled to Aaru Village. Despite his circumstances, he managed to cultivate a garden in the barren desert and befriended the children there.[2]
As the years went on, however, Shafaqat became more and more disillusioned by his situation. Realizing that his daughter, whom he had been forced to leave while she was still a child, was by now grown up, he came to despise children and his demeanor gave him the nickname "old ghost" among the villagers. Only Affan still respected him and treasured that which Shafaqat left behind after his death.[2]
