Fadhlan is a scholar from Sumeru Akademiya who traveled to Liyue Harbor sometime in the past. He compiled the drafts for Customs of Liyue, which was then edited by local scholars before being published.[1] His history- and records-related research makes him a likely member of either the Vahumana (history and social science) or Haravatat (runes and linguistics) Darshans.
