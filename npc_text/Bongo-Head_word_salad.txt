Profile[]
Bongo-Head was originally a Floating Hydro Fungus that lived in the wild. During the first iteration of the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament, the Traveler and Paimon caught several fungi to make their team for the tournament, which included Bongo-Head. They would go on to win numerous matches, only to discover that the tournament was actually a plot by the Elchingen, a Fatuus, and Kautilya to control the fungi and take over Sumeru. Unlike the other fungi, Bongo-Head was able to resist Elchingen's control due to sharing a stronger bond than the backdoor control implemented in Elchingen's orb. 
After the truth of the tournament was revealed, Haniyyah decides to take the fungi into her care until the Wisdom Orb technology was improved upon. Bongo-Head would stay with Haniyyah alongside Blitzara, Kindlejoy and Twirly-Whirly and would catch up with its owner from time to time.
