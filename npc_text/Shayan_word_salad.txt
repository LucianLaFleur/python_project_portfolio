Dialogue[]

Shayan: Hi, can I help you?
Shayan: If you run into smugglers, careful not to fall for any of their scams. Report them at once.
 Is there a lot of smuggling going on?
Shayan: This is Sumeru City's small port. Since it's right under the Akademiya's nose and is garrisoned by the Corps of Thirty, it's much easier to deal with smuggling problems here than at Port Ormos.
Shayan: But there will always be a handful of people who don't have their heads on straight and try to pull a fast one here.
Shayan: Hmph. I'd urge them to really think it through first.
 Excuse me.
Shayan: See you. Please tell me the moment you come across any smuggling activity.
