Dialogue[]

Futuh: Mold's going to grow on my head if this goes on...
 Mold...
Futuh: No kidding. Even sand can grow mushrooms if it's surrounded by this damp and sticky air every day!
Futuh: I just want to finish this, get my payment, and go sunbathing in the desert...
 About the desert...
Futuh: Oh, I didn't mean that I actually plan to return to that lousy desert, I meant Aaru Village on the desert's border.
Futuh: I heard from the village elders that Aaru Village used to be a part of King Deshret's Citadel! How amazing!
Futuh: If you think about it, Aaru Village may be in the desert, but life is pretty nice there. You don't have to endure wet weather, and you can go shopping at Caravan Ribat too.
Futuh: You probably won't make much money there, but you'll find everything else in that place pretty neat.
 See you.
Futuh: See you... I really hope I can leave soon...
