Raimondo's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Augustus Lovelace claims that "ever since Raimondo and Mr. Choiseul took over the reconstruction project, the spirit of research at the institute has been in freefall."[2]
Raimondo and Choiseul initially struggle to keep the Institution afloat, but upon meeting the Traveler, had them assist Nacker. Unfortunately, Nacker had ulterior motives and nearly caused the Institute to blow up in the foreseeable future, but Raimondo, with the Traveler's assistance, manages to salvage the situation. He would later try to track Nacker down, leading him to Lumidouce Harbor where he tasked Fusilier with continuing the investigation. As a reward for helping him and Choiseul out, they bestowed them with the title "Honorary Senior Researcher". Eventually, the Traveler comes upon him at Lumidouce Harbor and assists him in tracking Nacker down.
After Nacker and Edwin were brought back to the Institute to take responsibility for their actions involving the facility's near-destruction, where Edwin claims that the Institute's inspiration would wither and die. Raimondo told him that he sparked much inspiration, but the Institute should calm down. Edwin then accuses him of not being worthy to lead the Institute, but Raimondo states that he at least knew how to keep it up and running properly and that he should avoid research and Arkhium. Having called the Maison Gardiennage over, he watched as the two were taken away to the Fortress of Meropide.

 A promising project
Media:VO Raimondo 01.ogg "Heh, this project seems to have a lot of potential."

Dialogue[]

Raimondo: This project looks promising. This one... requires further deliberation...
 How are the Institute's research projects going?
Raimondo: Some projects were restarted, some have been suspended, some of the researchers have returned to duty, some were furloughed...
Raimondo: It's just as Monsieur Choiseul said, everything is in order, and that is enough. I'd rather not have another "explosive surprise".
Raimondo: Order. That is what the highest priority is...
(Obtain  Teachings of Order ×3)
 Why do you think Nacker stole the core?
Raimondo: Do you still remember when I was flipping through the pictures Ms. Chronie took in the ruins?
Raimondo: There's one of Nacker working in front of the suppression device. It's quite blurry... but I'm quite certain that his actions are definitely not part of any operational procedure.
Paimon: That doesn't really mean anything, though. Maybe... maybe a thief came flying across from the nearby mountain and stole the core?
Raimondo: Heh, that's most definitely impossible. The energy flow of the Arkhium in the ruins is the best anti-theft measure there is. No ordinary person can withstand it.
Raimondo: Besides, the timing of the Experimental Field Generator's activation is simply too perfect. It cannot be a mere coincidence...
Raimondo: I have a preliminary conjecture. Nacker — or should I say, the one who stole the core — likely removed the Arkhium Kinetic Core early on, activating the backup energy source.
Raimondo: However, Pneumousia Cores are relatively inefficient energy sources, and they have to keep up a continuous output of energy to reach the activation threshold of this contraption here.
Raimondo: Hence, this person intentionally activated that large Arkhium chunk, creating a modest, but rather noticeable explosion.
Raimondo: This way, when the Institute sent someone to investigate, they would be certain to fix the Arkhium Inhibitor first.
Raimondo: And by the time they realized that theey'd have to go to the Experimental Field Generator to retrieve the backup energy supply, the Generator would have already finished charging.
Raimondo: From a technical perspective, such a modus operandi is highly probable, and those within the Institute capable of doing this would only be Edwin, Mr. Nacker, and myself.
Raimondo: I doubt Edwin had the opportunity to do anything to that effect... which leaves two remaining suspects. Myself, and Mr. Nacker.
 Maybe this was all your doing, then.
Paimon: Yeah! You said that Nacker lied, but you've also been lying all along!
Paimon: Maybe this was all just part of your plan, and you tricked us into escorting you here so you could grab whatever it was you wanted.
Raimondo: Your accusation is not entirely baseless. After this, I will also apply for and submit myself to the Institute's credibility review.
Raimondo: As far as I'm concerned, though, Mr. Nacker is the one more likely to have committed this act. If this really was his doing, then he should be the one with the most to gain from it.
Raimondo: Even if I am listed alongside him as a suspect... his chances of being convicted are certainly greater than mine.
 Have you found any good projects?
Raimondo: Projects... Haeh. Honestly, I haven't found anything worthwhile that we can get underway quickly.
Raimondo: Of the ones I've examined, the best have, at most, "relatively optimistic future prospects."
Raimondo: But what can we do? After all, all the valuable projects were personally destroyed by Mr. Edwin Eastinghouse.
 About Nacker...
Raimondo: The Institute has already opened up investigations matters concerning Mr. Nacker, and has dispatched several special investigators. However, we have not yet found any useful leads.
Raimondo: Hmph... Personally, I sincerely hope that both Mr. Nacker and the Arkhium Kinetic Core were both blown to pieces.
Raimondo: ...Although I am also painfully aware that the Fontaine Research Institute is unlikely to be that fortunate.
 I'll let you continue.
Raimondo: Do what you need to do. I must continue working.
