Story[]
While at Sumeru Akademiya, Alva Nikola researched how Electro Abyss Mages manipulated Electro and with this knowledge, developed a theoretical weapon dubbed the Nikola Coil. However, his research was lost, ostensibly to a fungal infection.[1]
One of his quotes is listed on the Bimarstan's Proverb Column.

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
Alva Nikola's surname is derived from Nikola Tesla, a Serbian-American inventor and engineer best known for his work in developing the alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. The Nikola Coil is a reference to Tesla's Tesla coil.
Alva Nikola's given name may be derived from the middle name of Thomas Alva Edison, an American inventor known for creating early versions of the light bulb and compared to Tesla so often that popular culture often portrays them as adversaries.
