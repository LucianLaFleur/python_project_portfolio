Story[]
Priscilla's background and origins are a mystery, although it is implied that she committed some kind of "sin(s)" in her past. She was taken on as a servant by Eberhart, who reassured her that he did not care about her past and that he wanted her by his side.[1] During her time as a servant, she became familiar with several members of the nobility, including Luther.[2]
However, unbeknownst to most of the nobles, she was one of Eberhart's co-conspirators in his plan to eliminate the corrupted aristocracy — even if it led to the deaths of the others. While the expedition to Dragonspine was underway, Priscilla stayed behind in Mondstadt. If the nobles in the city were to find out about Eberhart's plot, she was to light a torch at Stormbearer Point as a warning for Eberhart.[3] They indeed discovered what was happening; she presumably lit the torch as directed, but never saw any ship come from the cape. She was presumably killed at the hands of the nobles.[1]
