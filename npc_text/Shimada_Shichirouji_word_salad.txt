Profile[]
Shichirouji has been a member of the Iwakura Clan since Eiin was the clan head. He was apparently never particularly skilled with the blade, based on Iwakura Mitsunari's remarks; Shichirouji remained at Shoden rank — the lowest known rank in the Iwakura Art — throughout both Nabatane and Mitsunari's tenures as clan heads.
When the Vision Hunt Decree was enacted, Mitsunari had his Vision taken and decided to join the Shogunate forces.[1] Many of the other clan members saw this as a betrayal of their clan's pursuit of righteousness and deserted him, choosing to fight against the Shogunate. Shichirouji went to Fort Mumei, though he apparently still retained a sense of loyalty to the Iwakura Art master; it is unclear whether he meant Nagatane or Mitsunari, however.
When the Traveler encounters him, Shichirouji attacks them for the "dishonor" they brought upon the Iwakura Art master. The Traveler is left with no choice but to kill him in self-defense. After receiving word that a Traveler has been going around killing Iwakura Clan members, two expelled members, Okazaki Toraemon and Yanagiha Arashi, find his corpse and collect his sword to create a memorial.[2][3]

Dialogue[]

(Upon approach)
Iwakura Art: Shimada Shichirouji: The dishonor you brought upon our master shall be cleansed by your blood!
(Upon defeat)
Iwakura Art: Shimada Shichirouji: The Iwakura Art... shall not be defeated...

Trivia[]
Even if Shimada Shichirouji is the first Iwakura Art Disciple the Traveler meets and defeats, his dialogue does not change, leading to a slight continuity error, because the Traveler could not have brought dishonor to the Iwakura Clan or their Master. Even if the player is to assume Shimada Shichirouji is placing the blame of his Master fighting for the Shogunate upon the Traveler, seeing as the Traveler is visionless and therefore "immune" from the Vision Hunt Decree, his words still make no sense. Its possible he is either delirious or delusional from his time in the wild and is simply lashing out at swordsmen in general.
