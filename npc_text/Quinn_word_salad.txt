Profile[]
Quinn is the owner of Quinn's Fruit, a fruit stall located near the Mondstadt's main gate. During daytime, he can always be found speaking to his childhood friend Beatrice, whom he sometimes calls Abby. Quinn is oblivious to her infatuation with him, and takes her attempts to flirt with him as a serious attempt to haggle for lower prices on his fruit.

Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Quinn: Fresh fruit only at Quinn's Fruit!
Beatrice: Quinn!
Quinn: Oh, it's you again. What will you have today?
Quinn: Just a reminder: No discounts!
Beatrice: Not even for a friend?
Quinn: I've said this before, and I'll say it again.
Quinn: No discounts on the goods, because they're worth the price!
Beatrice: Oh, come on!
Beatrice: What if I bring you lunch?
Quinn: No discounts. No matter what you say!
Beatrice: Please! Pretty please?

Nighttime[]

Quinn: 1 Mora for three apples...?
Quinn: What is she thinking... *hic*
 Who are you?
Quinn: *hic* Oh, it's you...
Quinn: That's right. I'm Quinn of Quinn's Fruit. My booth is at...
Quinn: Fresh fruits only at... Quinn's Fruit...
Quinn: Wait... Have we met before?
Quinn: (I'm feeling light-headed...)
 Apples...
Quinn: *hic* No fruits at night... No discounts too...
Quinn: *hic* Come again...
 Who's she?
Quinn: Oh, you mean Bea?
Quinn: Dunno, what she's thinking.
Quinn: Bargaining with me everyday... Even if she's a close friend of mine...
Quinn: I couldn't sell her three apples for 1 Mora even if I wanted to...
Quinn: You'd agree, right? *hic*
 See you.
Quinn: *hic* A... Another!

Event Dialogue[]
Invitation of Windblume and Windblume's Breath[]
Daytime[]

Beatrice: I'm being serious, there really are heart-shaped Sunsettias around Cape Oath...
Quinn: Bea, your eyes must have been playing tricks on you. Sunsettias just don't grow into that shape. It's against the laws of nature.
Quinn: And even if they did exist, there's no way that they could be sweeter than the ones I'm already selling.
Beatrice: Well, why don't we just go over to Cape Oath to have a look? It won't take long...
Quinn: No. This has to do with my convictions! Using visual attraction to sell fruit is just a cheap trick. I would never do that.
Beatrice: ...Oh come on, why won't you just get it already...
Quinn: Hmm? Come again?
Beatrice: *cough* Uh, nothing... Come on, just consider it for a second!

Nighttime[]

Quinn: Even if she's a close friend, my resolve won't be shaken... *hic*
 Who are you?
(Dialogue options and responses are the same as normal)
 Who's she?
Quinn: Oh, you mean Bea?
Quinn: Dunno what she's thinking.
Quinn: Ever since the Windblume Festival began, she's been bugging me about Cape Oath and heart-shaped Sunsettias...
Quinn: Sunsettias of that kind just don't exist...
Quinn: You'd agree, right? *hic*
 See you.
Quinn: *hic* A... Another!

Of Ballads and Brews[]
Daytime[]

Beatrice: Quinn!
Quinn: ... It's you again, you're not gonna drag me into giving you another discount, are you?
Quinn: Before you saying anything, I'm way too busy for this Weinlesefest!
Beatrice: Even if you're busy, you shouldn't forget about me!
Beatrice: No matter fruit or fruit wine, for the sake of childhood friendship, can't you get me a discount?
Quinn: I've told you many times, the fruit is not on sale. And I'm just helping deliver fruit to the drink stands. How can you insist on a discount?
Beatrice: Come on, hook a sister up!
Beatrice: I know you love wine. I'll get some and share with you. Then I'll help you make some refreshments. Could you just give me a discount?
Quinn: No discounts. No matter what you say!

Nighttime[]

Quinn: Weinlesefest...is truly and amazing festival!
Quinn: If it never ended, everyone would be able to have Dawn Winery's Weinlesefest specialty everyday...
Quinn: Eh, I really needed this to relax and forget about that nag...

Trivia[]
Quinn is one of the Four Drunkards, local legends of Mondstadt on par with the Grand Master Varka, and is nicknamed "Sir Dullwits the Oblivious Merchant" due to him being oblivious towards Beatrice's feelings.[2][3]
