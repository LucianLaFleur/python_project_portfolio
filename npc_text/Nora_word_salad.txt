Nora's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Nora is usually alone playing by the Anemo God statue because Patton, her father, is too busy working at the Angel's Share tavern. She does not mention her mother, so it can be assumed her mother is either not present or has passed away. Sister Grace, who prays by the Anemo God statue, takes care of her instead.[2]
In Venti's Story Quest, "Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land", Nora is seen playing with her imaginary friend.

Appearance[]
Nora is a small girl with pale white skin of Caucasian ethnicity. She has light brown hair tied back into two twin braids at the back of her head. Her eyes are turquoise or blue-green in color. She wears a blue short-sleeved pleated Victorian-style dress bare-legged with white ankle-length socks and brown Mary-Jane shoes.

During A Child's Secret

 Guess what? Clouds can swim!
 A big huge cloud can swim just like a little goldfish!
 Let's climb up onto the statue's hands to get a better view!

Dialogue[]

Nora: What's this? You want to play with me?
 About Stormterror...
(After completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
Nora: Daddy said that Stormterror must have come because I wanted to climb up the god's statue...
Nora: I'm sorry! I won't ever climb the god's statue ever again... *sobs*
Nora: Lord Barbatos, please don't be angry... *sobs*
 Where are your mom and dad?
Nora: My dad is Patton!
Nora: He's at that place where all the drunken uncles go.
Nora: Dad has a busy job, so I play by myself a lot.
 Hey kid, what are you doing?
Nora: I like playing by the god statue!
Nora: It's so big and so pretty.
Nora: Have you ever climbed to the top? I tried to climb it once but got told off by Grace.
Nora: Grace is a nice lady, I don't want to make her mad again.
Nora: But if you go up there, I wanna hear what the view is like!
 Goodbye.
Nora: You're going? Oh well, bye!
