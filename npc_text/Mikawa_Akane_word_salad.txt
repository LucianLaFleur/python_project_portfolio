 Yeah, the temperature of the Royal Hot Springs...
Media:VO Mikawa Akane 01.ogg "The temperature of the water in the Royal Hot Springs is just right."

Dialogue[]

Mikawa Akane: Hello, this is the Royal Hot Springs at the headquarters of the Tenryou Commission.
Mikawa Akane: You don't look like someone from the commission. Did you get lost?
 Who are you?
Mikawa Akane: I'm Mikawa Akane, manager of the Royal Hot Springs. I'm in charge of serving and arranging accommodations for the lords from the Shogunate who are here for the hot springs.
Mikawa Akane: Traveler, you must have just arrived in Inazuma. I can tell you stories about the Inazuma hot springs, if you'd like.
 I'd like to know about these hot springs!
Mikawa Akane: Unlike Natlan, there are actually no natural hot springs created by volcanic activities in Inazuma.
Mikawa Akane: A long time ago, after hot spring culture had been introduced to Inazuma, the locals became fascinated by the warmth and relaxation brought about by the hot water. So they tried every possible way to create a hot spring in Inazuma.
Mikawa Akane: In the end, Lord Hiiragi Hiroshi from the Kanjou Commission introduced a high-efficiency boiler from Snezhnaya, which could bring up the temperature to the level of a hot spring. The water was also mixed with precious minerals and plants collected from various nations. Thus, the first Inazuma hot spring was created.
Mikawa Akane: Although there are also hot springs for the commoners in Inazuma, I don't think they can afford these minerals due to financial restraints. As such, they don't really have the same benefits as the Royal Hot Springs.
Mikawa Akane: But if it's a hot spring funded by the Kanjou Commission, the outcome could be different... Hehe.
 May I try the Royal Hot Springs?
Mikawa Akane: I'm sorry. I can't let you do that.
Mikawa Akane: The Royal Hot Springs are only for those from the Shogunate. Access priority is based on a strict hierarchical system.
Mikawa Akane: With private rooms and very few customers, it is also often the place for our lords' private discussions. No outlanders allowed.
 Goodbye.
Mikawa Akane: Okay, goodbye.
