According to Mona, "Megistus" (meaning "great") is a suffixal identifier and functional surname of mages under Barbeloth's tutelage.[2] Barbeloth was already once known as Barbeloth Megistus, but renamed herself "Trismegistus" (meaning "thrice as great") to distinguish herself from her students. According to her, Barbeloth is a visionary,[7] someone who is so skilled at astrology that she can read the fortunes of entire nations, Teyvat and the world itself. Mona's greatest wish is to overtake Barbeloth in hydromancy and become known as the world's greatest astrologer.
Barbeloth is also the friend and rival of Alice,[8][9] a famous adventurer and powerful mage. She is only talented in astrology, whilst Alice was well versed in a variety of magical fields.
Though Barbeloth initially did not understand what Alice saw in Andersdotter, she later grew to respect her and realized that her acuity for the world's operating principles could sometimes surpass that of astrology.[10]

I'm not sure you'd understand even if I told you. But since you ask... The method I use is called hydromancy. The art of inferring fate from the illusory reflection of the stars on the water's surface. The inverted reflection in the water is an image of the heavens from within which the truth of our world can be observed. ...It is the one and only success story of that old lady's research endeavors.More About Mona: IV Media:VO_Mona More About Mona - 04.ogg Media:VO ZH_Mona More About Mona - 04.ogg Media:VO JA_Mona More About Mona - 04.ogg Media:VO KO_Mona More About Mona - 04.ogg Mona Megistus, the Astrologist — we came up with that name together, the old lady and me. She said it had a nice ring to it... But then she started calling me 'Meg' for short, which is obviously unnecessary, because clearly 'Mona' is already suffice for a shorter name— No! You are NOT allowed to call me that, it's embarrassing! Gah! I knew I shouldn't have told you!

Trivia[]
Barbeloth has a fondness for picking out hats, and helped Alice pick Klee's hat.[11]
Barbeloth wrote Vol. 2 of The Little Witch and the Undying Fire.
Etymology[]
"Barbeloth" may stem from the Gnostic aeon Barbēlō, a supreme, androgynous entity in Gnosticism known as God's first thought, being His "feminine aspect" and the Mother-Father of the aeons.
Barbēlō is also called "Barbeloth" in many historic texts and is thought to be a corruption of the original name.
"Trismegistus" is derived from Hermes Trismegistus (Ancient Greek: Ἑρμῆς ὁ Τρισμέγιστος "Hermes the Thrice-Greatest"), a legendary figure associated with the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth and considered the father of Egyptian alchemy.
Notes[]

Ascertaining this is akin to reading the fortune of the whole world. I'm afraid that this is not something that just anyone can do. If I could do it, you would no longer call me an astrologist... but a visionary. [...] The old hag could do it, and I'd bet there are others amongst those Hexenzirkel colleagues of hers who could do something similar.
