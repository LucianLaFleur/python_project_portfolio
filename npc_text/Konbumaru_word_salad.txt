Neko describes "Konbumaru" as a good and smart child, who loves to sleep in high places. Neko had initially heard of the name "Konbumaru" from Asase Hibiki, who was talking about Takamine the Mistsplitter, and believing that she was talking about a good thing of some sort by Hibiki's expression, decided to name a cat "Konbumaru" every generation.[1]
