Dialogue[]

Shajar: I'm still conducting inspections, so if you have something to say, quick and simple's best.
 And you are...?
Shajar: I'm an officer of general affairs here at Bayda Harbor. Call me Shajar, or Boss. Either's fine.
Shajar: I'm not the sort to insist on honorifics. People should win respect through their actions.
 About Bayda Harbor...
Shajar: Bayda Harbor's a place where many influential forces criss-cross, but the peace has been kept so far — it's my job to make sure everyone stays in their corner, after all.
Shajar: So don't worry. Ordinary smugglers know better than to try anything cute here.
 That's amazing.
Shajar: It's just my job. Some people don't trust my origins, and if there's one thing I hate above all, it's doubters.
Shajar: Oh yeah, I almost forgot. I used to be an Eremite Mercenary... and then I accepted the Akademiya's employment offer. So now I run things here.
Shajar: No difference between those jobs, if you ask me. "Get paid," "do stuff," and tack on a little "don't mess with me." Easy game.
Shajar: Judging by your looks, you're that sort of person yourself, I'll wager?
 Uh...
Shajar: Alright, that's enough chit-chat. I've got duties to get back to.
 How about big-time smugglers?
Shajar: If you mean the local Eremites, I was one of 'em once. I know how they do things.
Shajar: As for those smugglers from Liyue and Fontaine...
Shajar: Hmph. I'd be tipped off well before they could move a muscle, and I'd know their movements like the back of my hand.
 Secret letter?
Shajar: Well, we've got too many outlanders here in Bayda Harbor, so some... diplomatic measures are necessary.
Shajar: I've got "friends" in Lumidouce Harbor and Yilong Wharf, so we exchange tips and such. Good deal as far as I'm concerned.
Shajar: *sigh* I'd originally come here to relax a bit. Didn't think this place would be as busy as Port Ormos...
 Actually, it's nothing.
Shajar: Well, no news is good news. See you.
