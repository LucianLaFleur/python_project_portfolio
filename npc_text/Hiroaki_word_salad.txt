Appearance[]
Hiroaki wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the ashigaru (Japanese: 足軽) of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient shitagi with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray kobakama, and waraji sandals without the socks. Although not visible, the Sangonomiya Clan's crest is imprinted on the back of the shitagi, below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with sode (shoulder armor), han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it.
