 Another tea-seller...

Dialogue[]

Chubo: All I know is that selling tea isn't enough. I've still got to live...
 And you are...?
Chubo: Oh? Outsiders, are you? Hello there, greetings!
Chubo: As you can see, I'm just a plain fisherman, barely scraping by...
Chubo: But I feel blessed to be able to fish in a place as pristine as Chenyu Vale.
Chubo: If you like fishing too, I can recommend several good spots where you can catch tasty fish!
(Obtain  Fish ×5)
 Seems like you're worried about something?
Chubo: Fewer and fewer people are fishing... Or to be precise, far fewer youths are willing to engage in agriculture nowadays.
Chubo: Tea does bring in a lot of money, of course, but you can't just bite and eat Mora.
Chubo: As far as I know, Qiaoying Village's grain production is barely self-sufficient, but many other crops must be purchased from outside.
Chubo: We're situated in the mountains, so if anything were to happen to the mountain path and stop the delivery of goods, now that be terrible news for us, wouldn't it?
Chubo: What's more, youngsters nowadays are all busy learning how to grow and prepare tea.
Chubo: It worries me terribly. Fewer and fewer fishermen like me, youngsters unwilling to take up grain production... Won't our local produce soon come to lack variety?
 You really care about everyone, don't you?
Chubo: The people in our village are a good lot, and the tea they produce is precious. I can't stand to see good people and precious things suffer.
Chubo: A place gains stability from the balance of its produce. I hope more youngsters will realize this...
Chubo: And stop focusing on just growing and selling tea, but consider the future of the entire village.
Chubo: I'll talk to Uncle Luo about my suggestions some other day...
 Goodbye.
Chubo: *sigh* What to do, what to do...
