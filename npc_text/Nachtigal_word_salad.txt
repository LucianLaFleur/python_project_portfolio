Media:VO Nachtigal All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Nachtigal: (Would Sumpter Beasts like to eat Sunsettias?)

Dialogue[]

Bonifaz: Aha! I have it. I know what we can do to keep Cyrus safe and make a living at the same time!
Nachtigal: Well, let's hear it then.
Bonifaz: Let's take Cyrus back to Mondstadt.
Bonifaz: I'll wager that the people of Mondstadt have never seen a beast as honest, strong, and lovable as our Cyrus. They'll pay good Mora to see him!
Bonifaz: Well, he'll have to spend a bit of time in a cage, the poor lad, but once we've got enough Mora, we can purchase a large field and bring Dandelions and Windwheel Asters here too.
Nachtigal: Seriously? Come on. Mondstadt has never been under anything like Inazuma's Sakoku Decree. If this method of yours would work, don't you think that the land there would be chock-full of Sumpter Beasts by now?
Nachtigal: Not to mention how we haven't paid off the debt we incurred when purchasing those Sumpter Beasts. We can't even leave Sumeru right now!
Bonifaz: Oh, right. Uh... I'll give this some more thought...
Nachtigal: Don't even think about it... Sumpter Beasts are meant for transporting goods.

Trivia[]
His name is derived from "Nachtigall", which is the German term for the common nightingale.
