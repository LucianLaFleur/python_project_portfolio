Profile[]
Setaria hails from the Great Red Sand. At some point, she became a scholar and joined the Sumeru Akademiya, eventually serving as Azar's entourage. She became involved with the sages' plan to create a new god out of Scaramouche, despite her misgivings.
She was initially seen accompanying him to confront the Zubayr Theater over their celebration of the Sabzeruz Festival, although her later appearance in the festival was actually a copy made to continue the dream samsara created by the sages to harvest the Jnana energy of the inhabitants of Sumeru City to power Scaramouche's ascension.
Despite the sages' efforts, the dream samsara was broken, although they appeared to have gotten the desired result nonetheless. Nahida, possessing the puppet Katheryne, suggested using Setaria's connections to her homeland as a means to convince her to join their cause. She managed to convince her after manipulating several others into declaring themselves followers of King Deshret, although unbeknownst to her, the sages had planted a listening device on her. Setaria attempted to acquire incriminating papers from the Akademiya, but was caught and detained.
Setaria's meeting with Nahida made her realize that she should become a teacher and bring knowledge to her people. Like the meaning of her name, she wants become a star for the people and share knowledge to her people who were deprived from learning. So, she resolved to return to the desert and proceeded to muster the courage to tell Azar of her decision to leave the Akademiya, but when she arrived at his office, he was nowhere to be seen and Cyno informed her that he was removed. She later accompanied him to meet with Rahman at Aaru Village, where they were discussing ways to increase the quality of life for the people of the desert, as they had been severely neglected by the former Akademiya.

Appearance[]
Setaria has long navy blue hair, brown eyes and tan skin. She wears one of the basic Sumeru Akademiya uniforms typically seen on members with high prestige in the Akademiya, as well as a diadem only seen on very high ranking members such as the Sages.

Trivia[]
Based on Kulsoom's dialogue, Setaria may hail from Aaru Village.
The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin (I) mentions the "dancers of Setaria," which suggests that there was an ancient city-state or group of people in the desert also named Setaria. Setaria shares this trait with Tighnari, whose name is shared with the people of Tulaytullah, who were known as the Tighnarians.
She shares her English voice actress, Cat Protano, with Skirk.
Etymology[]
The name Setaria is most likely derived from the word Sitara (Sanskrit: सितारा) meaning "star."
