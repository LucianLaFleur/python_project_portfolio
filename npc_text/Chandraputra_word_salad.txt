 This is all great, but...
Media:VO Chandraputra 01.ogg "This is all great, but have you heard any uh... weird noises recently?"

Dialogue[]

Chandraputra: So, uh, Ms. Paula... Have you heard any funny noises lately?
Paula: I think you make funny noises, Uncle. Does that count?
Chandraputra: No, no, I don't mean that kind of funny! I mean something that might be useful to a creative process! If not, my "The Shadow Over Petrichor and the Liliacruces Riddles" is going to...
Chandraputra: *cough* Anyway, Ms. Paula, have you ever heard something weird that you wouldn't be believed about even if you told the adults?
Paula: Hmm... Now you mention it, I think I've heard some strange noises in my sleep...
Chandraputra: Oh! And then what? Then what? What do you think that was, Ms. Paula? Have you heard it before?
Paula: Hmm, let me think... How about this, then? Let's play another round of Genius Invokation TCG! If you win, I'll tell you!
Chandraputra: Huh? Wait... Look, we've played for days now. And still...
Paula: Eh? Well, it's alright if you don't wanna know. I'll just play with Ms. Contarini then.
Chandraputra: No, wait! Wait! I'll play with you, alright? But please, stick to the deal we made, alright?
