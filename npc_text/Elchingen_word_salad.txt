Profile[]
Elchingen claimed to be a wealthy, experienced businessman from Fontaine who has lived in Sumeru for a while and thus has adopted their clothing and traditions. However, other businesspeople attending the tournament remarked that his business decisions indicated that he was a rookie merchant who suddenly gained a fortune and did not know how to capitalize on it,[1][2] while Yae Miko was suspicious of how he amassed such a large fortune without attracting any fame.[3] It is unknown how much of his background is true after the revelation that he is a member of the Fatui.
In reality, Elchingen was a subordinate and admirer of Il Dottore's who sought an opportunity to cause chaos in Sumeru and to that end, bribed Kautilya, who had discovered a way to modify the Capturing Device and Withering Potion previously designed by Amurta scholars; the Capturing Device was modified into the Wisdom Orb, while the Withering Potion was the basis for Floral Jelly. The two used the tournament as a ploy to gather Fungi and make people drop their guard around the elemental creatures. After holding the contest a few times and integrating Fungi into people's everyday life, they would use a backdoor command installed on the Wisdom Orbs to take control of the Fungi and use them to cause destruction throughout Sumeru.[4][5]
When the Traveler and Paimon appeared as contestants and made it to the Ultimate Trial, Elchingen decided to use the opportunity to make a name for himself in the Fatui by eliminating the Traveler with the Fungi, posing it as an unfortunate accident, and let Kautilya take all the blame. However, he overestimated the effectiveness of the Wisdom Orbs' backdoor command and Bongo-Head remained loyal to the Traveler. Yae Miko also easily broke the technique Elchingen used to seal the domain for Ultimate Trial and brought herself, Layla, and Haniyyah into the arena. After rousing their respective Fungi from Elchingen's control, they proceeded to use their elemental companions to defeat Elchingen's minions.[4]
Elchingen fled the arena, only to find the Matra and the Corps of Thirty awaiting him. He and Kautilya were arrested and were set to be transferred to prison.[5] While awaiting his transfer, Elchingen managed to escape capture and sought to seek help from nearby Fatui divisions. However, an unnamed Fatui commander, who saw him as a liability and a danger to the Fatui, anticipated his actions and ordered Yurochka to rendezvous with Elchingen around Chatrakam Cave, posing as an ally and assassinating him when the time was right, then eliminate the rest of Elchingen's subordinates.[6] Based on the relevant description for the Special Wisdom Orb, Yurochka succeeded in disposing of Elchingen,[7] although the Traveler can encounter Yurochka and either defeats or kills him, leaving his status on the rest of his task unknown.
