When the Traveler and Paimon seek out the adeptus Mountain Shaper, they encounter Li Ding, who reveals that he and Li Dang came to Jueyun Karst in search of the treasures. Li Dang, however, was trapped in an amber prison and Li Ding implores the Traveler to save him. After they do so, the two vow to renounce their treasure-hoarding ways and leave.
They also appear in Hu Tao's character demo trailer, "Hu Tao: Let the Living Beware." In it, they obtained a treasure map from Bao'er for hidden treasure in Wuwang Hill. Hu Tao, who was in the area to perform funeral rites, plays pranks on them before defeating them in battle and sending them running. It is unknown when this occurs relative to the Archon Quests.
