Dialogue[]

Katayoun: Hello, are you here to borrow books? Do you have your access permit as a student or teacher?
 About the House of Daena...
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

Katayoun: The House of Daena is the library of the Akademiya. Researchers and students can borrow many books on general knowledge.
Katayoun: Some books are only open to higher-level researchers for use in their literature reviews.
Katayoun: After all, most knowledge can be obtained through the Akasha. Many people who still read just want to see the source of knowledge with their own eyes.
Katayoun: I'd say the House of Daena is more like a museum in spite of being known as "the library of Sumeru."
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

Katayoun: The House of Daena is the Akademiya's library. Researchers and students can borrow many books on general knowledge here.
Katayoun: Some books are only open to higher-level researchers for use in their literature reviews.
Katayoun: In the past, most knowledge could simply be obtained through the Akasha, so many people only read books to personally ascertain the source of any knowledge they gained.
Katayoun: For a long time, the House of Daena was really more of a museum than a library.
Katayoun: But ever since the Akasha was shut down, the number of applications requesting access to it has increased greatly. I believe that the Scribe is presently hard at work dealing with that matter.
Katayoun: I reckon that more people will find their love of books rekindled soon.
 About yourself...
Katayoun: I'm the librarian who's in charge of lending and sorting books.
Katayoun: My family has been in this line of work for generations. I've had a thing for the smell of newly-printed books since I was a kid. So I'd say I've landed a dream job.
Katayoun: But the work turned out to be more simple than I'd imagined.
Katayoun: Many come here not to borrow books, but instead to look for a quiet place where they can contemplate issues.
Katayoun: So I don't really have much work to do except for tidying up the bookshelves.
 See you.
Katayoun: See you.
