Hugues was a former staff member at the Fontaine Research Institute who was sent to the Fortress of Meropide to serve jailtime for the crime of modifying a Gardemek.

Idle Quotes[]

 Need those parts...
Media:VO Hugues 01.ogg "...I really need those parts. What's taking him so long?"

Dialogue[]

Hugues: I wonder if Lucelle's doing alright...
 Lucelle?
Hugues: *sigh* An old companion of mine. It could have lived free after I modified it, but then they took it away from me.
Hugues: There was no time to take anything back, because they then gave me a new workplace — the Fortress of Meropide.
Hugues: By the way, before Lucelle belonged to me, it was a Gardemek with the Gardes.
Hugues: It didn't resist when I modified it, so I took that as consent.
 And that's how you landed a new job in jail.
Hugues: ...Yes.
Hugues: Even so, this job has some perks over my previous work at the Fontaine Research Institute.
Hugues: My time in Meropide was more conducive to creativity, to be honest, given the lack of complicated processes and boring summary meetings.
Hugues: Even my daily meals were delivered by clockwork machines. Such an enviable situation! A shame, though, that the canteen manager refused to sell me that machine.
 Alright, such an innovative spirit should be praised.
Hugues: I doubt this is a compliment.
Hugues: No matter what, such an innovative spirit deserves praise.
Hugues: I have some materials of various sorts, please take some. See if you can come up with some innovative ideas.
(Obtain  Condessence Crystal ×4)
 Not too sure about what you're saying here.
Hugues: No problem, just take it as me talking to myself.
