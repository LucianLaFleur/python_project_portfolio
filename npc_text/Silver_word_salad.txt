Profile[]
Silver is the younger of Navia's two attendants.
During the events of Deluge of Wrathful Waters, Silver was dissolved by the Primordial Sea while trying to save other people when the water began flooding Poisson. His consciousness was forged into an Oceanid, where he and Melus protected Navia from the collective of other Poisson victims after she nearly fell into the water, who wanted to absorb her consciousness. The act was long enough for Neuvillette to save her from being completely dissolved, where he gave his final farewell to her.

Appearance[]
Silver wore a white shirt under his dark gray suit coat, accented with a navy tie. He wears black pants, gloves, and shoes. His hat is dark with an ochre ribbon. Silver had black sunglasses and dark purple hair.
