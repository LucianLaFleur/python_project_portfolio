Dialogue[]

(First interaction)
???: Greetings, my yet-to-be-friend! Be you a traveler who frequents these trails?
???: Apologies for halting you halfway along your path but... Um, could you enlighten me as to the events that transpired here?
 I'm (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Pleased to meet you.
Tanjiyy: Tanjiyy, Vahumana Dastur, at your service. I came here to provide... educational assistance to the... Ah, yes, the Tanit.
Tanjiyy: This whole affair is most odd. This should be the right place, but... Oh, how did things turn like this...
 It's... a long story.
Tanjiyy: Could be a tribal warfare, or some kind of internal conflict, hm? Very interesting. It's been centuries since a conflict occurred in these sands that saw an entire tribe annihilated.
 Maybe they... migrated.
Tanjiyy: Migrated? No. Look, the supplies and the tents are right where they used to be. There's ash and signs of former habitation everywhere... Hm. Honestly, it's more like a great disaster swept through suddenly and upended all their lives.
Tanjiyy: Additionally, I discovered signs that I found most... ominous. I recommend against checking yourself. It's... revolting, and will likely make you retch.
Tanjiyy: Perhaps it might have been the work of survivors among them — survivors who later returned to gather most of the... abandoned belongings. Alas, I cannot be sure. Either way, it was a highly disquieting scene.
 ...
Tanjiyy: *sigh* How did I encouter something like this? I feel like I've witnessed an event that'll make into the history books...
Tanjiyy: Ahem. Anyway... would you like to play cards?
Tanjiyy: I found a few decks in those tents, and they're still in a decent state — after some cleaning, that is. If you're interested, perhaps we could have a game or two...
 I don't mind.
Tanjiyy: Haha, then let's begin! Let's see... I have three decks here. What do you think, which one do you want to challenge? For the record, I'm really good at this.
 (Challenge the deck with dark-colored stains on its card box...)
 (Challenge the deck with blade marks on its card box...)
 (Challenge the deck with claw marks on its card box...)
 Uh, I'll pass...
 Sorry, I'm not in the mood.
Tanjiyy: Ah... Mm, I understand. My apologies... Take care.
(Consequent interactions)
Tanjiyy: Ah, it's you! Never thought you'd come back!
 You're still here?
Tanjiyy: Haha, yeah, I've reported everything I discovered to the Akademiya and applied for a new project...
Tanjiyy: Now, I'm going to figure out what on earth happened here...
Tanjiyy: Mm, this will add a nice footnote to my historical research.
Tanjiyy: Don't worry about my safety. The General Mahamatra's keeping an eye out for us. He's promised to provide abundant supplies and protection for the researchers sent here.
 Historical research...?
Tanjiyy: Yeah, why do you look so surprised?
Tanjiyy: The legend of the God King is part of history, Parvezravan's family affairs are part of history... and so is the mysterious tragedy of the Tanit.
Tanjiyy: To put it simply, think about these questions: How do we piece together the fragmented truth?
Tanjiyy: What purpose did the record-keeper hold when they wrote down those words? What were they thinking?
Tanjiyy: ...All of them are history.
 Did you find anything?
Tanjiyy: Did I find anything? Hmm... How about a remianing belief in the Goddess of Flowers? Eh, I'm afraid whatever is left of that belief has been wiped out now — it's gone for good.
Tanjiyy: And... I found many books smuggled out of the Akademiya. The amount is very huge if I do say so.
Tanjiyy: Some of which are completely foreign to me... Uh, for instance... these are books about "films." What did they want these for?
Tanjiyy: But apparently, we were wrong to presume that the desert folks were illiterate fools who would turn their noses up at knowledge... They were truly extraordinary.
 How about a round of Genius Invokation TCG?
Tanjiyy: Haha, a fellow player, huh? Lucky me!
Tanjiyy: I have three decks here. Take a look. Which one do you want to challenge? Just for the record, I'm pretty good at this.

 Bye.
