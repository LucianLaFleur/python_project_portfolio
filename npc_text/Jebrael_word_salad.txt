Profile[]
Jebrael was a member of the Eremites who used to live in the desert. He was originally part of the Tanit tribe.
Both Jebrael and Samail were part of an expedition team sent by Babel to explore the ruins of Gurabad.[1][2] Babel's true plan included eliminating adherents of King Deshret,[3] so she also hid a mole within the expedition team, Tarafa, tasked to assassinate the entire team. Jebrael faked his own death and struck down Tarafa before he could target Samail, leaving Samail and Jebrael as the only survivors. The two left the Tanit tribe afterward, which irritated Babel and led Jebrael to be considered a traitor to the tribe.[1][4]
Jebrael and Samail eventually joined, or founded, a group of Eremites known as Thutmose. Thutmose was interested in the legends of secrets of Al-Ahmar, hiring researchers to help out. One of these researchers was Ufairah, and Jebrael ended up having a daughter, Jeht, with her. After the birth of his child, Jebrael began to have second thoughts about continuing his work and attempted to flee the desert with Ufairah, but Samail saw through the plan and killed Ufairah. Jebrael was still able to escape with Jeht and they left the desert. He was thereafter known by Thutmose's remaining members as the "Treacherous Grit."[5][6]
Jebrael and Samail would not meet again until the events of the Golden Slumber quest series. During their investigation across the ruins, Jebrael ran into Samail, who had begun collaborating with the Fatui to find Al-Ahmar. After finding Khaj-Nisut, the group discovered King Deshret's throne when Samail and his lackeys arrived. Jebrael managed to trick Samail into sitting in the throne and reciting a prayer to send him to the Golden Slumber, but underestimated his will, as Samail proceeded to wrestle complete control over the Golden Slumber and attempted to drag them with him, sealing off the exit as they tried to flee. With no other choice, Jebrael willingly went inside the Golden Slumber himself to confront Samail and allow the others to escape, sacrificing his life in the process.
