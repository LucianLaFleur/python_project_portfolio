Dialogue[]

Louis: The tastiest food in the world, get it here! Come, dear friend, would you like some?
 Do you have a menu?
Louis: Over here, dear. Take your time reading it — tell me what you'd like, whenever you like.
 Could I have your name?
Louis: Friend, they call me the face of street food.
Louis: If I were to be given some high-flown title like some great figure, they would call me "Fish-and-Chips Louis." Simple and elegant, no?
 Do you have recommendations?
Louis: Ah, you've come to the right man, friend. We make the best fish and chips in the world here!
Louis: Fish and chips for breakfast, to energize you in the morning. Fish and chips for tea, beloved by all the children...
Louis: And do I need to mention fish and chips for a walk through town? Their crispness and fragrance are praised by the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol Captain and seagulls alike!
Louis: Why, I cannot imagine what would become of Fontaine if fish and chips did not exist!
 Is it really that delicious?
Louis: Heh. Dear, let me pack this up for you. You'll know it once you take a bite.

 See you.
Louis: If you should ever want some fish and chips, I shall see you then.
