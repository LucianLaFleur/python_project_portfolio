Profile[]
According to Uncle Ghast, in the distant past, Dusky Ming succumbed to a fatal illness when she was a child, leaving her mother greatly bereaved. For whatever reason, Dusky Ming's spirit remained in the mortal world. She prepared food for her mother and even brought her to a nearby hilichurl camp where she was promptly surrounded. Instead of attacking, however, the hilichurls began dancing Dusky Ming's favorite dance — the girl had befriended the hilichurls from the afterlife.
Some time later, Dusky Ming moved into the Wangshu Inn, where she spent her time spooking visitors as entertainment. While Verr Goldet was aware of her presence as Xiao had told her, she found the ghost benign and made no attempt to drive her off. However, the inn's cook, Smiley Yanxiao, had not been notified of this and became terrified when Ming began messing around in the kitchen, refusing to cook. The Traveler and Paimon chase Ming, who then possesses a Ruin Hunter. After disabling it, she promises not to haunt the inn in return for them being her playmates.

Appearance[]
Dusky Ming is the spirit of a young girl. She has black braided-hair and black eyes, and wears a traditional Liyue dress.

Trivia[]
Qiqi has a Voice-Over line about Dusky Ming, in which she senses that Dusky Ming is doing stretches with her, but the zombie is unable to see the ghost.
This currently makes her the first NPC who is specifically mentioned by a playable character through their voice-over.
Dusky Ming is also alluded to in a message on the Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board.
Little Yi claims to have met Dusky Ming, suggesting that she has wandered over to Qingce Village in the past.
The song that Dusky Ming likes singing is Hu Tao's "Hilitune," suggesting that she has either met the funeral director personally, or overheard it on her ghostly travels around Liyue and took a liking to it.
