Profile[]
"Kichiboushi" is a bake-danuki who gave Ioroi company. He was sealed alongside many of his kin by Kamuna Harunosuke; however, as Harunosuke did not properly seal all of the bake-danuki away, some of them were able to escape their confinement, "Kichiboushi" being one of them. During the events of cleansing the Sacred Sakura, Ioroi has "Kichiboushi" bring the Traveler and Paimon bring them to the corrupted Sakura roots underneath Chinju Forest.
Some time afterwards, Paimon and Traveler decided to visit Ioroi on a whim. Ioroi, remarking on the other lands he saw prior to his petrification and that he had no knowledge of them, decided to have "Kichiboushi" accompany the two outside Inazuma as he was excited to play with them again and wanted to train more. When the Traveler remarked that they wanted to talk with "Kichiboushi" during their travels, Ioroi gave them a bake-danuki feast so they could understand what "Kichiboushi" was saying. The training mostly consisted of taking "Kichiboushi" around various places across Mondstadt and Liyue.
At the end of the trip, "Kichiboushi" was brought back to Chinju Forest and promised to uphold and remember what the Traveler and Paimon had taught him.

↑ Japanese: The kanji for bou in Kichiboushi is normally supposed to be read as hou, but it was likely romanized as bou as a result of Rendaku. Also, an alternative reading of 吉法師 is Kippoushi, the childhood name of Oda Nobunaga.
