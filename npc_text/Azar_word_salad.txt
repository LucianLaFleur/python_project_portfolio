Profile[]
Azar was the Grand Sage of the Sumeru Akademiya. At some point after Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death, he and the other sages wished to have a new and proper god after her replacement, Lesser Lord Kusanali, was a disappointment in their eyes.
Expelled scholar Il Dottore, now a Fatui Harbinger, returned to Sumeru and offered to make them a new god, which Azar and three other sages accepted without hesitation. The other two, who opposed the plan, were subsequently locked up under his orders. Azar oversaw a large-scale preparation to create their new god, creating a dream samsara to harvest the energy of the city's inhabitants and various other resources needed to create the vessel for their new god to reside in. Dottore provided the sages with Scaramouche for this operation. During the Sabzeruz Festival, he threatened Nilou and ordered her to tear the stage down before deciding to ban public art performances.
When Cyno noticed anomalies in the data he submitted into the Akasha System, Azar declined his request to investigate and outright told him he had no right to judge him, causing him to resign as General Mahamatra in protest.
After Kusanali was freed from the sages' custody, Cyno apprehended Azar and forced him to repent in front of the Archon. After hearing that Nahida had restored Irminsul, Azar and his accomplices supposedly repented, and they were subsequently exiled to the Avidya Forest, where they now spend their time cultivating their wisdom.[1]

Appearance[]
Azar has orange eyes, white hair, and a fair complexion. He wears a purple sherwani styled with beige and green decorations. He also wears a purple cap with a copper eight-pointed star, alongside the akasha terminal on his left ear.
