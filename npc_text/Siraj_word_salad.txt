Siraj is a scholar from the Vahumana Darshan, currently incarcerated for participating in activities considered illegal by the Akademiya. He was known for working on a thesis regarding a "collective consciousness" which would unite multiple bodies into one mind; this idea would be vetoed by Azar, then the Akademiya's Grand Sage, on Alhaitham's advice, on ethical and practical grounds, infuriating him.
Refusing to believe that his thesis was rejected on running the risk of endangering lives, which was a violation of the Akademiya's code, and viewing it as a personal slight against him by Alhaitham, Siraj decided to proceed with his collective mind regardless, and began recruiting a number of socially-isolated scholars to assist him with this project; one notable scholar Siraj recruited was Ilyas, by "peer pressuring" him to join when he was at his lowest point. Each scholar Siraj recruited would be named for him, followed by a number, with the number increasing with decreasing importance. Siraj's idea of this collective consciousness was to have these multiple individuals serve his purpose; he also implanted thoughts of hatred for Alhaitham into their minds. With this hatred in mind, these individuals would set out to kill him if he approached them; in the event they did kill him, Siraj would then install himself as the Akademiya's new grand Sage and "lead them towards a new future".
Once he had completed his collective consciousness, Siraj sent out Ilyas to lure Alhaitham into the hideout containing his collective consciousness; Ilyas successfully lures Alhaitham into the hideout and reveals to him his true colors. With Alhaitham now in the hideout and in range, Siraj attempts to kill him out of spite; Alhaitham however manages to exploit a weakness in the collective consciousness using Ilyas, causing it to become unstable. Panicking, Siraj attempts to regain control of his collective consciousness but ultimately fails as the negative emotions of the other members of the collective are too much for him to bear; in his vain attempt to wrest back control of his collective consciousness, he loses his footing and falls over a platform as the negative emotions assault him, to which he can only scream in agony in response. After the destruction of the collective mind, Siraj and the other members are arrested and escorted away by the Matra, with Siraj dejectedly admitting defeat.
