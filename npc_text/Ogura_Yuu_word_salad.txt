Ogura Yuu's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Ogura Yuu is a Shogunate Samurai who is stationed in Kannazuka and the older brother of Ogura Mio. He deeply misses her, and longs for the day that the war between the Shogun's Army and the Watatsumi Army ends so that he can go home and help her with their shop, Ogura Textiles & Kimonos. He also wants to take his sister to Liyue to see Silk Flowers in person.

Appearance[]
Ogura Yuu wears a standard uniform modeled from the ashigaru (Japanese: 足軽) of feudal Japan. He wears a purple-gray shitagi, lavender kobakama, white socks, and waraji sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with pale gold accents consists of dou (breastplate) with the Inazuma Shogunate's crest, kote (armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves). He is equipped with a juumonji yari (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead.

Dialogue[]

Ogura Yuu: Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!
Ogura Yuu: This is a watch tower. If you don't bring any urgent news, please find another route, traveler.
 Is something on your mind?
Ogura Yuu: I have a sister who's taking care of our family business, Ogura Textiles & Kimonos, in Inazuma.
Ogura Yuu: My sister and I grew up around textiles and have been making clothes since we were little. If my military duties didn't force me to be stationed here at the watch tower, I would be home helping out with the shop.
Ogura Yuu: If the disputes between the Shogunate and the Sangonomiya can someday be resolved, I can go back home to be reunited with my family and help my sister with the shop.
 About Ogura Textiles & Kimonos...
Ogura Yuu: Ogura Textiles & Kimonos is a shop that my family has run proudly for many years. We only use the best quality materials and pay very close attention to the details. Many samurai lords used to come to the shop to purchase high-grade silk from Liyue.
Ogura Yuu: Have you ever been to Liyue? The Feiyun Commerce Guild there produces silk that is as smooth as flowing water. It's used to make top shelf clothing.
Ogura Yuu: I hear that it's because of a locally-grown red flower named Silk Flower that they can produce of such quality.
Ogura Yuu: If I get the chance, I'd love to bring my younger sister to Liyue and take a look at the Silk Flower fields...
 Goodbye.
Ogura Yuu: See you. Be careful out there.
