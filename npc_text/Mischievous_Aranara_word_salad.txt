  Open-World NPCsAranara 




Mischievous Aranara are part of the Aranara located in various areas of Dharma Forest, Sumeru.
There is a total of 8 Mischievous Aranara. They can be spotted with Seed Mirrors which have been activated using Electro. If the hiding Aranara is found while the Seed Mirror is still affected by Electro, it will relocate nearby and can be interacted with. After being spoken to, they will not give any reward directly, but instead leave behind two one-time investigation points.
Finding Mischievous Aranara does not require completing the Aranyaka World Quest series or activating a Sumeru Statue of The Seven, which is a requirement for starting Aranyaka (the Traveler encounters Aranara for the first time after unlocking any Statue of The Seven in Dharma Forest).

Dialogue[]
Aranara #1[]

(Talk to the Mischievous Aranara after discovering them)
Mischievous Aranara: Oh no, you found me...
Mischievous Aranara: Hmm... Maybe Aranara should ask other Aranara for tips on Hide-and-Seek. Who would be better at this, Aranishat or Aralila?

Aranara #2[]

(Talk to the Mischievous Aranara after discovering them)
Mischievous Aranara: You found me? Aranara thought it was a good hiding spot... If Aranara went into the dirt, then Nara would be at a total loss, right?
Mischievous Aranara: Ah! If Nara doesn't find Aranara and just walks away... Then for how long does Aranara have to lie in the dirt? No, that's not acceptable at all!

Aranara #3[]

(Talk to the Mischievous Aranara after discovering them)
Mischievous Aranara: You found me? So, Nara do have sharp eyes like those birds that only come out at night.
Mischievous Aranara: But I heard birds in some regions have red eyes at night... That's scary!

Aranara #4[]

(Talk to the Mischievous Aranara after discovering them)
Mischievous Aranara: Knock-knock! It's Aranara! You found Aranara. Aranara openly showed up, and will openly exit the game!
Mischievous Aranara: Being found doesn't mean you lost the game! Nara successfully found Aranara. Aranara has been successfully found. It's a win for both, hehe.

Aranara #5[]

(Talk to the Mischievous Aranara after discovering them)
Mischievous Aranara: Getting found by Golden Nara... This is a "lucky" thing, right? It must be.
Mischievous Aranara: Golden Nara is "lucky" to find Aranara today!

Aranara #6[]

(Talk to the Mischievous Aranara after discovering them)
Mischievous Aranara: Eh? Found me already? What do I do now? Oh, right, that...
Mischievous Aranara: Good Nara! Nara doesn't see anything here. There's no Aranara! Not a single one!

Aranara #7[]

(Talk to the Mischievous Aranara after discovering them)
Mischievous Aranara: You caught me... Even though I was not literally "caught," I was still spotted...
Mischievous Aranara: U—Uh... "Finders do whatever they want!" Hmm... Am I saying it right?

Aranara #8[]

(Talk to the Mischievous Aranara after discovering them)
Mischievous Aranara: Whew, I can finally come out now! Only a true friend of Aranara could find me so fast!
Mischievous Aranara: I wanted to hang out with Nara more... Will Nara come back again? What would Nara say? "We'll see about that!" Right?
