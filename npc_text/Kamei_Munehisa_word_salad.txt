Profile[]
Kamei Munehisa was a yoriki that served in the Shogun's Army. When the Vision Hunt Decree was enacted, Kamei felt that the Shogunate's actions were wrong and left the army. Instead of becoming a ronin like many deserting samurai had done, Kamei opted to live an honest lifestyle and tried to look for employment, but many shunned him, believing him to be a ronin himself. As a result, Kamei would occasionally go out to forage for food, but had difficulty trying to keep himself afloat.
Some of Kamei's friends resorted to banditry and attempted to convince him to join the group, but he refused each and every time they came, citing his morals.
Kamei would encounter the Traveler and Gourmet Supremos during his travels, having encountered them after clearing a group of hilichurls and taking what he needed. Sometime later, he was confronted by his former friends yet again. When they saw Julie, they assumed he had joined another clan to kill them. Kamei fought the group off as best he could and was eventually saved by the Traveler. The Gourmet Supremos then decided to take Kamei with them for extra security as he could fight off human enemies; while he would not be paid particularly well, he would not have to worry about food. Kamei accepted the offer and gave the Traveler a recipe for Sashimi Platter as a reward, which he had learned while working with the Shogunate.

Appearance[]
Kamei Munehisa wears a  lavender shitagi, indigo kobakama, and he is barefoot in waraji sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with dark gold accents consists of dou (breastplate) with the Inazuma Shogunate's crest, han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves). He is also wearing sode (shoulder armor) on his left shoulder. Kamei carries a katana at his hips on the left side with the blade facing down.

Etymology[]
His given name 宗久 (Munehisa) can be also read as "Soukyuu" by using the Sino-Japanese reading of the kanji. As such, his name may be an homage to Imai Soukyuu (Japanese: 今井宗久),[1] a 16th-century Japanese merchant and tea ceremony artist. He was largely influential in the development of Japanese aesthetics and cuisine and is considered to be one of the Three Great Tea Masters of Japan in his period.
His surname Kamei is perhaps a word play on that of the historical figure. Ima (Japanese: 今) in Imai means "now" or "present," whereas kame (Japanese: 亀) in Kamei means a "turtle," which is regarded as a symbol of longevity in Japan.
