Profile[]
Teucer is a young boy from Snezhnaya and the younger brother of Tartaglia, Tonia and Anthon.[3]
After learning of the Traveler through Tartaglia's letters (and feeling lonely without him), Teucer took a boat from Snezhnaya to Liyue to look for him. Teucer somehow managed to wander out of the harbor and into Lingju Pass where he encountered a massive "Mr. Cyclops", which the Traveler ran into and destroyed. Upon learning of the situation from him, they brought him to Northland Bank where he reunited with his older brother. Childe, not wanting to let Teucer know of his relationship with the Fatui, asked the Traveler to help babysit him, but Teucer quickly grew bored, wanting to see his brother at work. Following two awkward run-ins with Childe, he promised to leave when he saw Liyue's "Institute for Toy Research", a facility that Il Dottore had abandoned. When the visit concluded, Teucer took the boat back to Snezhnaya.

Appearance[]
Teucer is a young boy with pale, freckled skin, blue eyes, and orange hair, strongly resembling his older brother. He is seen wearing what is likely traditional Snezhnayan clothes, including a brown and white bomber hat.

He treats me just like family. Oh, and speaking of family — Tonia and Teucer are always telling me about the pastries and other gifts he brings them when they write. So while I've been away from Snezhnaya, he's kept his promise to take care of my family.More About Tartaglia: III Media:VO_Tartaglia More About Tartaglia - 03.ogg Media:VO ZH_Tartaglia More About Tartaglia - 03.ogg Media:VO JA_Tartaglia More About Tartaglia - 03.ogg Media:VO KO_Tartaglia More About Tartaglia - 03.ogg However far away my motherland may be, we all live under the same sky. That snow-white moon... My family must be able to see it too. I hope my siblings... *sigh* I hope that they have turned out to be formidable warriors as well.
