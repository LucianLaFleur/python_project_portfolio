Story[]
Thompson Reed was from Fleuve Cendre. He learned to live by "survival of the fittest", using lies to move upwards in life. When met Leticia in her journey to Fleuve Cendre, he saw it as an opportunity to gain prestige via connection to House Randolph.[1] He compelled her to experience the world with her for some time.[2]
Leticia joined Eduardo Baker's resistance group.[2] The pair later participated in the occupation of Poisson.[3] Thompson tried to convince Leticia to leave the resistance group prior, describing how their children "should not be born amidst cannon fire, or grow up amidst the mud and filthy waters", even saying that the goals of Eduardo's group were "confused dreams" and it had a "mission with its outlook yet unknown".[1] However, Thompson had already planned to betray the resistance group.[1] He informed the Marechaussee Hunters of secret paths by which to invade Poisson.[2] It is not clear what happened to Thompson during or after the Siege of Poisson.
At some point, Leticia and Thompson formed a pact.[2]

Trivia[]
There is evidence that suggests that Leticia and Rosa Reed, the woman mentioned in Fleuve Cendre Ferryman, may be one and the same:
Leticia had abandoned her name and taken on the name of the rose, which fitted with the name Rosa.
Her husband is named "Reed"
Leticia had a child, and Rosa was holding an infant during Karl Ingold's photo session.
Therefore, Leticia's husband and Rosa Reed's husband are one and the same: Thompson Reed.
Thompson Reed was likely part of Eduardo Baker's entourage from the beginning.
Baker's operations began in Fleuve Cendre, which was Reed's hometown
In Verdict, Reed mentions a "Boss". This "boss" says "Let all that the sun shines upon belong to them, and let the Fleuve Cendre belong to us," a quote attributed to Baker in Fleuve Cendre Ferryman.
