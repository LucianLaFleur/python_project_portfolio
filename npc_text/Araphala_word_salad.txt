Araphala's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Araphala and his "family" met the Traveler's Sibling sometime before the cataclysm, where he and his brothers became interested in cooking after watching them cook. However, they quickly ended up arguing and were kicked out of Vanarana (Subarea) by Arapacati, where they went their separate ways.
Araphala ended up near Devantaka Mountain to pick sunsettias, as he had done so with the Golden Nara and hoped that if they returned, he would share it with them. However, he ended up getting attacked by a Ruin Drake, causing him to enter a cave and enter a slumber. After the Traveler discovered the Aranara, they were tasked by Arapacati to find her brothers to begin Festival Utsava.
The Traveler found Araphala in a cave near Devantaka Mountain, using Dendro to wake him up. After explaining that he ran from a "scary monster," the Traveler found it was a Ruin Drake and destroyed it, allowing Araphala to resume his training. He offered them the "Unrivaled Fresh Fruits," although they were not modified apart from being sliced.
Araphala thanked the Traveler for finishing his training and returned to Vanarana, where he and his brothers were scolded by Arapacati. When the festival began, the Traveler gave them a serving of Radish Veggie Soup. While Araphala did not like the taste, he remarked on how delicious the "unrivaled fresh fruit" was.

Appearance[]
Araphala has a large Aranara build with a predominantly green hue to his body and arms. His hat is full of sunsettias.
