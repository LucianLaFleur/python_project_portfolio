Profile[]
Florent serves as the Spina di Rosula's Senior Advisor.
During an investigation into wondering who was responsible for sending Clockwork Meka to assassinate Navia, Melus considered Florent one of three primary suspects. However, he was quickly ruled out as he did not have enough funds to afford them.
After Melus was dissolved while evacuating the people of Poisson, Florent now handles some of the roles that he originally dealt with.
