Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing ???)
Akim: You get what you pay for. Do you think the work I do is the same as everyone else's?
Harim: Doing things differently from others doesn't mean your work is worth more.
Harim: Besides, everyone can learn masonry from the Akasha. What makes you so different?
Harim: If it weren't for the fact that we're old pals, I wouldn't be going out of my way to make sure you're getting business.
Akim: The knowledge foundation might be the same, sure, but what gets built on it is different!
Akim: Unlike other people, I'm an innovator! I've also tried more kinds of clay...
Harim: Aha! Caught ya! And you said you weren't asking me for more money because you wanted to buy new materials!

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After completing ???)
Akim: You get what you pay for. Do you think the work I do is the same as everyone else's?
Harim: Doing things differently from others doesn't mean your work is worth more.
Harim: Besides, everyone can learn masonry from the Akasha. What makes you so different anyway?
Akim: Hah! I wouldn't speak so soon. Akasha's been shut down... and anyway, everyone does things differently!
Harim: Alright, alright! Let's just say that you win, and your unique craftsmanship is why I buy your goods! Sheesh. If it weren't for the fact that we're old pals, I wouldn't be going out of my way to make sure you're getting business.
Akim: Hah. The foundational knowledge might be the same, sure, but what gets built upon it is different!
Akim: Unlike the others, I'm an innovator! I've also tried more kinds of clay...
Harim: Aha! Caught you, haven't I? Didn't you claim that you weren't asking me for more Mora because you wanted to buy new materials?
