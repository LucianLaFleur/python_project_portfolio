Zuria is an art dealer who originated from a place named "Destree." She and her family eventually came to Fontaine, and made "Destree" their surname. Subsequently, her husband died in an accident.[1]
During the events of Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures, Zuria commissioned Freminet to create Thelxie, a mechanical penguin named after a supposed Water Imp of legend. She claimed her son Lescot Destree had been suffering from "Loneliness Syndrome" since he was eight years old, and often fantasized about the Water Imp, to the point where he could no longer differentiate between reality and the fantasy world he made where Thelxie was a prince of the Kingdom of Water Imps; Zuria said that her son started believing that he was Thelxie himself. Zuria then planned to "guide" her son's fantasies by creating a storybook from the adventures the mechanical Thelxie would undergo in hopes that his loneliness syndrome would be cured; she subsequently got the help of Freminet, the Traveler, and Paimon to act out Thelxie's adventures.[2]
However, it was revealed that Lescot had already died one month prior to the events of Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures; before he died, Zuria left him as she had been organizing an art exhibit specifically prepared for him, and was not able to see her son one last time. Stricken with grief, she contracted the same loneliness syndrome that Lescot was afflicted with and even started to believe that Thelxie was her actual son. To aid Zuria, her companions completed Thelxie's adventures, helping her finish her storybook and giving the closure she needed.
She eventually started to recover from her illness and decided to continue her art exhibit, with her storybook and experience with guidance therapy included to help those suffering with the same illness she and her son contracted.[1]
