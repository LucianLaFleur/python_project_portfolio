Dialogue[]

Takugen: The theme isn't bad, but as for the plot... I wonder if it's good enough...
Takugen: Ah, Traveler! My apologies. I got distracted for a moment thinking about light novels...
Takugen: Is there anything I can help you with?
 About Zero Hour Invokation...
Takugen: Oh, that's right, I'm the one in charge of Zero Hour Invokation. Are you here to play?
Takugen: You're welcome to build your deck here. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me.
Takugen: Your opponent Secchu Tou is ready to begin. You may start the match anytime once you're prepared.
Secchu Tou accepted your challenge, and has come to the table...

 About the mechanical paintings...

Takugen: It's such a pleasure to enjoy works like these...
Takugen: Ah, I'm sorry... Let's get back to the topic.
Takugen: If you're interested in trying the mechanical paintings, you should head over and take a look.
 I've got other things to do right now...
Takugen: That's alright, I won't be going anywhere for a while. I have a job to do after all...
