Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Kamran: If it wasn't for the forest's alleviating effect on the disease... Someone with Eleazar would have never been allowed to be a Forest Ranger.
 Eleazar?
Kamran: Huh? Who are you? What are you doing here? Why are you asking about that?
 I'm just passing by.
Kamran: Right.
Kamran: This is Gandharva Ville. You can rest here if you're tired.
Kamran: If you don't want to be "educated" by the Forest Watchers, then take a look at the stuff on the noticeboard.
Kamran: Forgive me for being unable to say more.
 Goodbye...
Kamran: Oh, bye then.

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Kamran: I never thought I'd see the day when someone would be cured of Eleazar... though I suppose that'll mean the end of that young girl's time with the Forest Rangers soon.
 Who are you referring to?
Kamran: Huh? Who are you? What are you doing here? Why are you asking about that?
 I'm a friend of Tighnari's.
Kamran: Oh, you're that Forest Watcher's friend, are you? My apologies.
Kamran: I'm referring to a Trainee Forest Ranger who's been stationed with us.
Kamran: She was here as part of her recuperation process from the first, so I reckon that she'll be leaving now that she's recovered.
Kamran: Now, she has said that she wouldn't mind staying on as a Forest Ranger, but you know — people change their minds all the time.
Kamran: You can't even trust what the sages say nowadays, so I'm not sure how hopeful I should be about anyone or anything else, you know?
 Goodbye...
Kamran: Oh, bye then.
