  Quest-Exclusive NPCs 




"Mary-Ann" is a quest-exclusive NPC who first appears in the World Quest Mary-Ann's Story in Series Ann of the Narzissenkreuz: Act III - "If She No Longer Dreams of You...". "Mary-Ann" is a hybrid consciousness Oceanid formed by the merging of Lyris and Mary-Ann Guillotin (also referred to simply as Ann).
During the conflict between the Marechaussee Hunters and the Narzissenkreuz Ordo within the remains of Elynas 400 years ago, Mary-Ann Guillotin was gravely wounded by the explosion. In her dying moments, Lyris dissolved and absorbed Mary-Ann's consciousness. Lyris then returned to Annapausis and took on the appearance of "Mary-Ann." She also created Ann, a young Oceanid with parts of her memories and dreams.

Profile[]
When Mary-Ann Guillotin was alive, she was raised in the Narzissenkreuz Institute up until the cataclysm 500 years ago, after which she and her brother Alain were adopted by Emanuel Guillotin at the behest of the Institute's late Vice Director, Basil Elton. After Alain, Rene de Petrichor, and Jakob Ingold all joined the Institute of Natural Philosophy, Mary-Ann often visited to assist her brother whenever his assistant, Carter Scherbius, had bouts of ill health.[1] Mary-Ann was far more cheerful and personable than her older brother, a trait appreciated by their friends, and Carter noted how "Rene and Jakob like Alain's sister a lot, too."[2]
After Mary-Ann became a member of the Marechaussee Phantom, Alain built her the mechanical assistant Seymour. As Rene and Jakob's research became more and more radical, Mary-Ann was assigned to capture the fugitive elements from the Narzissenkreuz Ordo as they were deemed to be a threat to Fontaine. This led to an altercation within the remains of Elynas, where a large explosion caused multiple human casualties, the destruction of many metal animals, and damage to Elynas' remains.[3] During the struggle, the Oceanid Lyris, who was part of the Ordo and the former director of the Narzissenkreuz Institute, ended up absorbing the personality of Mary-Ann for reasons unknown. After the battle, Mary-Ann was presumed deceased. The merged consciousness of Lyris and Mary-Ann became the Oceanid "Mary-Ann." "Mary-Ann" constructed the dream world of the Annapausis, hiding herself within a fairy tale that the human Mary-Ann had told Lyris many years ago[4] to avoid confronting the harsh reality of all that had happened, and waiting for everyone else from the Institute to return. As a result of this dream, "Mary-Ann" accidentally created the Oceanid Ann, who possesses the memories of both the real Mary-Ann and Lyris, while acting in the role of the hero that Mary-Ann Guillotin dreamed herself to be in the fairy tale.[5]

Appearance[]
Mary-Ann appears in Mary-Ann's Story as a young woman with short, bright blue hair, wearing a white dress. Her blue hair and her Hydro-affected body when viewed with Elemental Sight are clues that this "Mary-Ann" is not the real person, but rather a Hydro Eidolon or similar elemental entity who has inherited her appearance and memories.

Story[]
History[]
Mary-Ann was raised in the Narzissenkreuz Institute up until the cataclysm 500 years ago, when its Vice Director, Basil Elton, entrusted her to former Marechaussee Hunter Emanuel Guillotin before Elton departed to battle against the dragon Elynas. After Elton's death, Emanuel took Mary-Ann and Alain in as agreed[6] and treated them rather well.[7] While Emanuel never grew close to Alain and Mary-Ann due to his lingering trauma from the Siege of Poisson incident, he nonetheless felt affection towards them and ultimately perished in hopes of creating a safer world for them.[8]
As Alain and Mary-Ann grew up, Alain joined the Institute of Natural Philosophy and there, created a thinking dog-like machine called Seymour to help Mary-Ann in her responsibilities as an agent of the Marechaussee Phantom.[9][10] They also maintained their friendship with Rene de Petrichor and Jakob Ingold, fellow children from the Narzissenkreuz Institute who were admitted into the Institute of Natural Philosophy at Alain's recommendation.[1] While observing their dynamic, Carter notes that "When the four of them hang out, she sometimes acts like an older sister to them, despite being the youngest."[2] Their friendship lasted for several years, until Rene and Jakob's increasingly radical research into the Abyss and the legacies of Remuria — and the failed experiment on Carter[11] — led to a permanent schism between them.[12]
After the Court of Fontaine deemed Rene's secret society, the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, to be too big a threat to Fontaine, Mary-Ann, Alain, and the others of the Marechaussee Phantom were assigned to capture its members. She, Seymour, and Alain tracked down Jakob and several other members to Elynas' remains, which led to a violent confrontation.[9] Seymour survived but was severely damaged in the process, while Mary-Ann's fate is left unclear. Due to his inhuman abilities granted by the power of the Abyss, Jakob survived and remains alive in present day.[3][Note 1]

Present[]
After entering "The Real Annapausis", Ann, Paimon, and the Traveler encounter a person who calls herself Mary-Ann. Over the course of their conversation, the three realize that not all is as it seems, and the Traveler deduces that the entire adventure they had experienced was all a "story" — one presumably based on the original Mary-Ann's life experiences, including her days of play-acting at the Narzissenkreuz Institute. After they realize this, "Mary-Ann" sends them away, telling them that her story has already ended.[13]
During the events of Rowboat's Wake, the newly defeated Narzissenkreuz helps Ann and the Traveler to once again find "Mary-Ann." Though "Mary-Ann" wishes to be left alone for eternity in the fairytale-like world she had constructed for herself in Annapausis, the Traveler uses the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz to destroy the illusion and bring her back to reality. "Mary-Ann" forgives Rene — now in the form of Narzissenkreuz — for all he had done and finally accepts the past, promising to live on as herself in the real world. She then sets out on a journey to explore the world together with Ann, Seymour, and Mamere, the Melusine Seymour had befriended in the years after the battle in Elynas.[14]

Notes[]

↑ Enigmatic Page (V) mentions Jakob's successful integration with Abyssal power and his "strength and transformation," likely referring to his ability to transform into an Iniquitous Baptist as seen in the World Quest Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog in Series Ancient Colors: Act III - Blue Longing of Heart and Moon.
