Dialogue[]

(Talk to Aradashan)
Aradashan: Ah, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), want to try fighting the Bulky Iron Chunk in your dreams?
Aradashan: We need to lift the Ararakalari we cast on the Bulky Iron Chunk, layer by layer, and finally, fight it with all Ararakalari lifted...
Aradashan: Aradashan will not help you suppress the power of the Bulky Iron Chunk this time. But don't worry, Arasata, Arayuta, and Arasaha will still help. Want to try?
 Sure.
Aradashan: Then let's get started!
 I'll need to make some preparations.
Aradashan: Ah, tell Aradashan when you are ready, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)...
(Fight the Bulky Iron Chunk)
(Talk to Aradashan after defeating the Bulky Iron Chunk)
Aradashan: Hehe, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) beat the Bulky Iron Chunk without Aradashan's help. Amazing!
Aradashan: Time for Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) to challenge a stronger Bulky Iron Chunk. Aradashan is sure that Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) can do it...
Aradashan: Or does Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) want to challenge Bulky Iron Chunk with only one stack of Ararakalari lifted again?
 Sure.
Aradashan: Well then, let's get started!
 Not now.
Aradashan: If Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) wants to challenge the Bulky Iron Chunk that has only one stack of Ararakalari lifted, just come to Aradashan...
