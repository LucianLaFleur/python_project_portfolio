Dialogue[]

(Before completing Transient Dreams)
Yurika: Hello, traveler from afar. Welcome to Inazuma. You may apply for a Resident Permit here.
Yurika: Also... Don't forget about the handling fee.
 Residence Permit?
Yurika: According to the Sakoku Decree currently in effect, foreign visitors must apply for a Residence Permit if they wish to stay on Ritou for a long period of time.
Yurika: Please get your Entry Permit prepared before applying for the Residence Permit... as well as the other necessary "materials."
 Handling fee?
(Before completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
Yurika: Of course. If you need to get something done, a handling fee is necessary.
Yurika: As for how much it is going to be... It depends on your reason for staying in Inazuma.
Yurika: The more urgent and more important the matter is, the more attention the Outlander Affairs Agency will pay. But of course, the required fee had best match that level of urgency, right?
(After completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
Yurika: Of course. If you need to get something done, a handling fee is necessary.
Yurika: 500 Mora per visitor.
Yurika: Hmm, is that very little? ...Oh, this is the first time I've seen people complaining about the low prices. But this is the official fee. If you don't believe me, please check the latest regulations issued by the Kanjou Commission.
(After completing Transient Dreams)
Yurika: Hello, traveler from afar. Welcome to Inazuma. You may apply for a Entry Permit here.
Yurika: Also... Don't forget about the handling fee.
 Entry Permit?
Yurika: According to the current regulations, foreign merchants must apply for a Entry Permit if they wish to stay and do bussiness in Ritou for a long period of time.
Yurika: As such, please get your indentification papers prepared before moving forward with these procedures... as well as the other necessary "materials."
 Handling fee?
Yurika: Of course. If you need to get something done, a handling fee is necessary.
Yurika: It will be 500 Mora per visitor.
Yurika: Hmm, is that very little? ...Oh, this is the first time I've seen anyone complaining about the low prices, despite the large number of people arriving to set up shop here.
Yurika: But this is indeed the official fee. If you don't believe me, please check the latest regulations issued by the Kanjou Commission.
 Goodbye...
Yurika: Take care. Please come back when you have prepared the required "materials."
