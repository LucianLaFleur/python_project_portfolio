Dialogue[]

Harris: Hey there! Frozen to the bone? Come and warm yourself back up with some nice hot food!
 I'd like a little something...
Harris: Whatever you're hungry for, just say the word. This weather's ripe for a piping-hot meal!

(If the player loses the match)

Harris: You may have lost, but keep your chin up! Here! Have some hot soup!
(If the player wins the match)

Harris: Congratulations! You won! Let's celebrate another victory with a feast!
 Who are you?
Harris: The name's Harris. I'm a chef and the person who built this camp.
Harris: I came here to help the adventurers in the area, to make sure they can get a bowl of hot soup at the end of a long day of adventure.
Harris: I reckon there's no greater joy than the feeling of hot soup in your system when you're just about frozen stiff.
Harris: The essence of culinary pursuit is to bring people satisfaction and joy, is it not?
Harris: It's a shame that lots of chefs have forgotten this... Personally, I was taught this simple principle by a young female chef who I met by chance while traveling in Liyue.
 See you around.
Harris: Sure! Remember, if you ever feel tired, you can always stop by to rest your feet and grab some grub!
