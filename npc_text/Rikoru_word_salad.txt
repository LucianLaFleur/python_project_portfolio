Profile[]
Here lies Rikoru no Mikoto. He loved to build. He once built a small-scale Dainichi Mikoshi. It was six feet tall and immensely vivid.—The Royal Tomb of Rikoru
Rikoru was the first Sunchild.[1] He originally admired Aberaku, the creator of the Dainichi Mikoshi, to the point where he built a miniature version of the structure. However, when Aberaku began to oppose the regime of the Sunchild and the nobles who controlled him, the nobles deceived Rikoru into thinking that Aberaku wanted to kill him and seize the throne for himself,[2] which Rikoru responded to by imprisoning Aberaku in the Dainichi Mikoshi for life.[1] Afterwards, Rikoru began to nurse a desire to build a structure even more impressive than the Dainichi Mikoshi to prove himself better than his former idol.[2]

Appearance[]
Like the other child Shades of Tokoyo, he is a translucent childlike figure without defining physical features.
