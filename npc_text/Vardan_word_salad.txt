Dialogue[]

(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Vardan: Thanks for saving my son, Great Rukkhadevata...
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Vardan: Oh, mighty Dendro Archon, thank you for saving my son from the vagaries of the sea...
 About your son...
Vardan: My son was a fisherman, and his boat capsized while out at sea.
Vardan: He was about to die until the Bimarstan doctors saved him at the last second.
Vardan: Ever since then, I started providing free medicinal herbs to Bimarstan.
Vardan: All we got is a small yard that didn't yield much, but we'd do anything we could to help.
 See you.
Vardan: Take it easy.
