Profile[]
When he was a new recruit, Javert was once admonished by the Harbinger Sandrone.
Some time before the Traveler arrived in Liyue, he accompanied Childe to the Yanshang Teahouse to collect a debt, only to find out the debtor also had a Sigil of Permission on him. Childe questions him with disappointment on his failure to notice the debtor possessed such a valuable item. Javert apologized for his failure, but Childe did not appear to accept or refuse it, stating that they had what they came for.
Javert later contacts Gentry Maocai and places an order for Cor Lapis, loaning him several thugs to bully reluctant sellers to sell at a greatly discounted price. He meets with the merchant at Xinyue Kiosk, warning him to get the mineral soon. When Maocai tries to buy Cor Lapis and realizes that the Feiyun Commerce Guild had bought all the Cor Lapis, Javert accompanies him to confront Xingqiu and the Traveler, only to be defeated. Realizing that they were stronger than expected, he backs off and leaves Maocai out of disgust when the merchant tells him to seize the Cor Lapis. He eventually receives his order from the merchant.

Trivia[]
His Chinese voice actor also voices Childe.
In the English, Japanese, and Korean voice-overs of Xingqiu's Story Quest, his voice lacks the distortion heard in enemy Agents' voice-overs. This is because their voice-overs were recorded during the Closed Beta Test, when Fatui Pyro Agents did not yet have a full-face mask and instead wore regular Fatui masks. When their design was changed for the game's public release, the Chinese voice-over was modified to add the vocal distortion, but the other languages were not. However, his voice was properly distorted in all languages for Childe's Character Teaser.
Javert is named after Inspecteur Javert from Victor Hugo's novel Les Misérables. In it, he is the primary antagonist, trailing the main character in an effort to catch him and send him back to prison. The name has become synonymous in media with members of law enforcement who, either due to ignorance or an extreme adherence to the words of the law, relentlessly hunt an offender, even if said offender is actually entirely innocent or has committed a very minor infraction they have either atoned for or was in service of a greater good.
