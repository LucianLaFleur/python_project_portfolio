Tighnari describes Naphis as a man of integrity who sticks to his beliefs.[4] Additionally, Naphis' short temper is "legendary," and even the former Grand Sage Azar would give Naphis some leeway as a result.[2]

Story[]
When the sages proposed their project to work with Il Dottore to turn Scaramouche into a god, Naphis was one of the two sages who opposed the plan. In response, they were imprisoned so that they would not interfere.[5]
The sages pretended that Naphis was still active and working on the project,[2][3] and they either wrote letters in Naphis's name or forced him to write letters himself, asking Tighnari to join their large project. These letters roused Tighnari's suspicions, as they lacked certain details that Tighnari had come to expect, such as dots that Naphis would routinely put on his letters to indicate the weather when he wrote them.[4] The latest letter that Tighnari received was also "uncharacteristically polite."
After repeatedly rejecting the requests by citing his duties as a Forest Watcher, Tighnari eventually offered to reconsider if Naphis would explain the project's purpose and its duration. Haravatat's sage, Khajeh, traveled to Gandharva Ville to personally invite the Forest Watcher, and in the discussion that followed, Khajeh insinuated that Tighnari's rejection damaged Naphis's reputation. However, Tighnari retorted that if the project was as important as they claimed, the short-tempered Naphis would have come to berate him in person. After seeing that they still would not answer the questions he had posed in his latest letter to Naphis, Tighnari rejected the invitation again.[3]
Once the corrupt sages were overthrown, Naphis was freed from imprisonment.[5]

My academic adviser wanted me to join the faculty after graduation, but to be quite honest, I prefer a somewhat freer research environment. From my observations, the way that the Akademiya handles certain matters leaves much to be desired. Fortunately, my adviser didn't push the issue — heh, not like that would've worked.About Cyno: Good Question Media:VO_Tighnari About Cyno - Good Question.ogg Media:VO ZH_Tighnari About Cyno - Good Question.ogg Media:VO JA_Tighnari About Cyno - Good Question.ogg Media:VO KO_Tighnari About Cyno - Good Question.ogg After my adviser's rescue, I wrote him a letter to send my regards. To my surprise, he wrote back saying that someone had already given him my regards in person. He ended the letter with a question "The General Mahamatra said he hopes that the sages will enjoy 'a more tasteful reputation' thanks to the efforts of our Darshan. Whatever do you suppose he meant by 'a more tasteful reputation'?" ...It's a good question. I'd like to know, too.
