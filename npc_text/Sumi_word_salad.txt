Idle Quotes[]

 Both sides are guilty...
Media:VO Sumi 01.ogg "Hmph. At the end of the day, both sides are guilty."

Dialogue[]

Sumi: Hey there, are you looking for me?
Sumi: You can talk to Yuuzou if it's work-related.
 Who are you?
Sumi: I used to work at Tatarasuna. Yuuzou rescued me from the ruins after the disaster — straight up saved my life.
Sumi: I have no obligations to Sangonomiya and can leave here at any time. But I've been through life-and-death situations with everyone here... I won't be separated from them again.
 About your companion...
Sumi: Though the resistance is definitely involved with the incident at the Mikage Furnace in some way, the Shogunate's policies are still way too harsh.
Sumi: I know the difficulties Vision-bearers face. I've taken some in before, after all.
Sumi: All in all, I don't particularly support either side, but I've chosen to stay here because of my companions.
 Goodbye.
Sumi: Okay, goodbye.
