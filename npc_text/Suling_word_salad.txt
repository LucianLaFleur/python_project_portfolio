Dialogue Set #1[]

(Available before completing Setting Sail)
Suling: Sorry, but I still need to check on our weapon readiness. If this isn't important, then don't bother me.
 Who may you be?
Suling: I'm the Alcor's chief smith. I'm also in charge of all the weapons used in this fleet.
Suling: If you're looking for a metalsmith, go hit Hanfeng's Ironmongers up. The boss there, Master Zhang, is my cousin. His craft is the finest there is in Liyue Harbor.
Suling: When it comes to smithing metals, I'm not his equal... but if we talk about familiarity with weapons, I don't believe myself inferior to anyone.
Suling: I joined Captain Beidou's crew to get a chance to look at rare and unusual weaponry.
 See you.
Suling: If you find some interesting weapons, be sure to let me have a look at them.

Dialogue Set #2[]

(Available after completing Setting Sail)
Suling: Hello there, Traveler! Sorry for the scant welcome, but I need to check on our weapon readiness, as always...
 Tell me more about yourself, if you would...
(Same as "Who may you be?", above)
 You seem awfully busy.
(After completing ???)
Suling: Heh, well, it's actually alright. The busiest I've been lately was when we were back in Inazuma. The Captain even told me to get geared up for some rough times.
Suling: I heard the other crew members praising you to the skies after our romp there.
Suling: Well, if you've got any ideas on how we can improve our weaponry, remember to give me a shout!
 See you.
(Same as before)
