Dialogue[]

(Talk to Arasata)
Arasata: Little strokes fell great oaks. Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), are you here to train as well...?
Arasata: But Aradashan, Arayuta, and I won't suppress the power of the Bulky Iron Chunk this time. Though it's in the dream, it is still super scary. Want to try?
 Let's do this.
Arasata: Please be careful.
 I'll need to make some preparations.
Arasata: Preparations are indeed needed before facing a mighty foe... Get ready before you start...
(Fight the Bulky Iron Chunk)
(Talk to Arasata after defeating the Bulky Iron Chunk)
Arasata: Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), you are like the wind that blows away mists and miasma. Even the strongest Bulky Iron Chunk will not stand a chance against you.
Arasata: But a Bulky Iron Chunk with all Ararakalari lifted is still very scary...
Arasata: If you are not ready, why not challenge a Bulky Iron Chunk with three stacks of Ararakalari lifted and hone your skills first...
Arasata: Want to challenge the Bulky Iron Chunk with three stacks of Ararakalari lifted again?
 Let's try again.
Arasata: Please be careful...
 Not now.
Arasata: Do not hesitate to tell Arasata if you need anything...
