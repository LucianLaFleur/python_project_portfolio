Dialogue[]

(Before unlocking Paper Shadow Ruminations)
Wenxun: Round and fluffy, soft and bouncy... Now that's coming along nicely, almost done!
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (She seems quite happy, concentrating so single-mindedly on prepping something... Best not to disturb her right now.)
(After completing Paper Shadow Ruminations)
Wenxun: Welcome, customer! Ready to enjoy another paper theater performance?

Wenxun: Woot! Please, enjoy!
(Opens the Paper Shadows A-Foraging interface)
 About the dish to be made at the end...
Wenxun: Oho! So you did notice it! Jueyun Chilis were indeed not among the ingredients they gathered in this paper theater production.
Wenxun: That's because the dish they're making is Eight-Treasure Duck. A real classic, that, and not at all spicy.
Wenxun: My family is used to food with lighter seasoning, maybe something a bit saltier if we're feeling adventurous, but not fans of the spice.
Wenxun: But I don't think a person should just stick with the foods they liked as a child... Everyone should gradually expand their culinary horizons, find their own tastes, and learn to appreciate all kinds of deliciousness.
Wenxun: It's a big big world out there, filled with so many mouth-watering meals! It's good to switch things up, even if for no good reason! Going with something blander first, then something spicier, can really spike your tastebuds' sensitivity!
Wenxun: So, even as I promote the cuteness of Guoba and Yuegui, I'm also recommending this Eight-Treasure Duck — I'll have you know that it goes well with all kinds of dishes!
 You've put in some serious work! I won't bother you, then!
Wenxun: Thanks for your concern! If my paper theater can cheer people up, then exhaustion's no issue! Remember to come back next time!
