"Monteverdi's famous opera" is a reference to Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda (The Combat of Tancredi and Clorinda), an operatic scena for three voices by Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi, while the "renowned actor team-up" is a play on words on the names of singer Freddie Mercury and soprano Montserrat Caballé, who performed together in the album Barcelona.
The Borja Family is a reference to the House of Borgia, an Italian-Aragonese Spanish noble family that rose to prominence during the Italian Renaissance, infamous for their meddling with political and ecclesiastical affairs through vicious means such as bribery and murder, while also hoarding power and keeping it inside the family through nepotism; their coat of arms is a red bull upon a yellow and green terrace. Rodrigo Borgia, later known as Pope Alexander VI, had numerous illicit relationships, from one of which his son Cesare Borgia, a condottiero who then became the head of the House of Borgia, was born.
Coppola Prizzi's "Apocalypse When?" is a reference to the war film Apocalypse Now, directed by Francis Ford Coppola.
The Babich Automated Analysis Engine is a reference to Charles Babbage's analytical engine, one of the earliest mechanical computers and a pre-cursor to the modern computer.
