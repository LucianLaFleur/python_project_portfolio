Captain Wu: Aah!
Captain Wu: You shouldn't sneak up on people like that, scared the life out of me...
Captain Wu: I'd finally made up my mind, then you made me jump and now I'm doubting myself again...
 About Rex Lapis' death...
(After completing ???)
Captain Wu: Mn, you know... Who should we business-people pray to now for good fortune?
Captain Wu: Now that Rex Lapis is gone, we won't be able to consult his divine predictions while doing business anymore. For someone like me, this is a disaster, plain as day!
Captain Wu: Eh, forget it. There's no use talking to you about that. I need to figure out if I should save this money or not...
 What're you doing?
Captain Wu: Ah, I'm just a regular seafarer. Worked hard my whole life, made a bit of Mora, now I'm debating whether to put it in savings or not...
Captain Wu: What do you think I should do? Save it, or put it to use?
 Save it.
Captain Wu: But, but, but... if I do that, what happens if the business opportunity of a lifetime comes along, and I've got no cash to invest?
Captain Wu: *sigh* Maybe you don't know. Being a trader can be very lucrative here in the Lord of Geo's country...
Captain Wu: If I used my capital to grow my business, I could really make a lot... Maybe one day I could even upgrade my boat to one like the type Ningguang has...
 Reinvest it.
Captain Wu: But, but, but, if I do that... What happens if the business goes south, and I lose everything in one go?
Captain Wu: Also, the Qixing are about to make some market readjustments. There's always a risk of getting caught out by their change in policy...
Captain Wu: If that happened to me, my lifetime's earnings could turn into sunk costs.
 See you.
Captain Wu: Alright then. Now, where was I...
