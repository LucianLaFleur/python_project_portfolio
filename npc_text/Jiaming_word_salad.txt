Dialogue[]

Jiaming: Well, mining operations have resumed, but we probably need to post up around here for a while more.
 Still?
Jiaming: Yes, that's right. I mean, this place was just recently rescued from a most chaotic situation. There's still ample opportunity for some parties to come in and cause chaos.
Jiaming: Well, but we do have some lucky sods being transferred back to Liyue already, like that You Jun.
 Thanks for your hard work.
Jiaming: Well, it's not like it can be helped. Better safe than sorry, as they say. In any case, we can't have another disaster here at The Chasm. We owe you a ton of thanks as well for solving the problem this time. Though I stand guard here, I do so with a hopeful heart for our future.
 Goodbye.
Jiaming: Bye. The Millelith will not forget your contributions.
