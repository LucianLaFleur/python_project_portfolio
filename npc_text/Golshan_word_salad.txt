Golshan: Blessings from the Dendro Archon. I hope all our patients will get well soon.
 Are you a doctor?
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Golshan: I'm just an intern. I still have a lot to learn.
Golshan: It is both my job and my wish to protect and help the weak.
Golshan: Stronger people are often under the spotlight, but medics should care more for weaker patients.
Golshan: Greater Lord Rukkhadevata might have the same vision as she led the researchers to build Amurta.
