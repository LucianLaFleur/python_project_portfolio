Dialogue[]

Masrur: Welcome to Port Ormos. Please register your ship here.
 Even if my ship is small?
Masrur: Is it a trader ship?
Masrur: Theoretically, we need crew info and reason for visit for all docking ships.
Masrur: Especially when it comes to trading.
Masrur: Unregistered ships doing business in Port Ormos will be curtailed and penalized.
 About Port Ormos...
Masrur: Port Ormos is the biggest port in Sumeru, and a key hub for trading.
Masrur: It's not as big as Liyue Harbor, but it still sees considerable traffic daily.
Masrur: So we'd like every ship to comply with the Navbed and continue Sumeru's prosperity.
 I'll leave you to it, then.
Masrur: Good journeys.
