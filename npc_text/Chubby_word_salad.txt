  Open-World NPCs 




Chubby, the Teapot Traveling Salesman (Teapot Spirit), is an open-world NPC that can be found in the Serenitea Pot. Talking to him will allow you to purchase unique Furnishings from the Traveling Depot shop.
Chubby appears only on certain days of the week, namely Friday, Saturday and Sunday. He will appear randomly in one of four total possible locations each week, one in each area (Chubby will only spawn in the unlocked areas). On Fridays starting at 4:00 AM, Chubby's shop will only be open to the player who owns the realm he is in. On Saturdays and Sundays starting at 4:00 AM, his shop will open to visitors and players will be able to visit their friends' Teapots to purchase items from him.
Purchasing items from another player's Traveling Depot is required for Round 4 of the Adeptal Mirror, as well as for a weekly Battle Pass mission.

Media:vo tips mimitomo store chubby 01.ogg Chubby: The one before you is known as Jade Seeker. One travels far and wide, seeking naught but to witness all of the treasures this world has to offer...
 What do you sell here?
Media:vo tips mimitomo store chubby 02.ogg Chubby: Ahh... encounters with fine treasures cannot be forced. This is something that only fate may decide.
(Opens Traveling Depot shop)
 Goodbye.
Media:vo tips mimitomo store chubby 03.ogg Chubby: To gain that which you treasure is a blessing indeed — but do not be aggrieved should fate deny you the object of your desire.

↑ Japanese: May refer to nonglutinous grain (not sticky enough to make mochi rice cakes)

↑ German: Slang word for Onion or Tuber, mainly used in Berlin. Tubby uses the formel word for Tuber instead ("Knolle"). Might also be a reference to Bolle's pigeon.

↑ Turkish: Both Tubby's and Chubby's turkish names translate back to "Chubby", the difference being that Tubby's name is the formal version of the word ("Tombili") while Chubby's being slanged ("Dombili").
