Dialogue[]

Bricole: Oh! You again.
 About Coutrot...
Bricole: Just being kicked out of the Fontaine Research Institute didn't bring him to his senses. He really is pigheaded.
Bricole: But nobody is backing him now, so you can relax. He can't cause any more trouble.
 Anyway, who is Kuisel?
Bricole: I don't know either. I don't recall anyone by that name at the Fontaine Research Institute... Perhaps, as far as he's concerned, it's better that nobody by that name exists?
Bricole: Just like he said himself, Kuisel was just a convenient character. The more different that character was from himself, the better, as it made it less likely anyone would recognize him... Although that's just a guess of mine.
Bricole: *Sigh* If you ask me, though, I think he changed enough over the years as it is. I didn't recognize him at first.
 About the device here...
Bricole: It's puzzling, isn't it? It seems like he's made... uh... various modifications to this place.
Bricole: Now it feels more suited to some ancient ruins that tourists might visit... Although perhaps it isn't too prudent to say it like that.
Bricole: *Ahem* The aforementioned viewpoint is only my personal opinion, and is not representative of the Fontaine Research Institute or its viewpoints.
 I'll let you work.
Bricole: Leaving so soon? Okay...
Bricole: *sigh* This place starts to feel scary if you're alone here for too long...
