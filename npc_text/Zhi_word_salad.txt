Dialogue[]

Zhi: Hello. How may I help you?
 What are you up to?
Zhi: Ah, I'm memorizing the names of herbs.
Zhi: I mean, when you go picking herbs in the mountains, if you don't even know what you're picking, wouldn't that be something of a joke?
 Do you live around here?
Zhi: Yes. Many people my age have gone to Liyue Harbor to work or settle down. I, however, have decided to stay here.
Zhi: I guess I was born with the nose of the mountain people. I just can't get used to the sea-salt tinge and the flavors of a city by the shore.
Zhi: What's more, the older folks in the village can't quite walk well anymore, so I have to help them pick herbs.
 I'll leave you to it, then.
Zhi: See you, and watch your step!

Trivia[]
Zhi left a message on the Qingce Village Bulletin Board, thanking Chongyun for saving her from falling into an abyss.
