 Duel
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Huangshan: Forgive me for saying this, but please, no need to go easy on me!
(If the player wins the match)

Huangshan: Brilliant! My defeat is utterly complete!
 Who are you?
Huangshan: I'm a guard for hire. I escort goods safely from A to B. Not to boast, but in all my time doing it I've never slipped up.
 Might I ask your name?
Huangshan: Haha, I forgot to say my name.
Huangshan: It's Huangshan.
Huangshan: I'm pretty well known on the merchants' route between Mondstadt and Liyue. I'm thorough in my work, and people so say.
 What about the rumors on the road?
Huangshan: A dragon attacked Mondstadt the other day, so I'm taking a temporary break.
Huangshan: I can deal with monsters, beasts and bandits no problem, but I'm not trying my luck against no dragon.
Huangshan: Speaking of rumors, this is where the rumors of two nations meet. I'm told the staff here are all informers for the Qixing.
Huangshan: The look on your face suggests you took that seriously. Ahahaha...
 About guards-for-hire...
Huangshan: You just need to know that it's a term specific to Liyue that refers to mercenaries who specialize in protecting cargo.
Huangshan: Well, the people of Liyue prize mercantilism, and traveling merchants must go far abroad. Our job is to protect them from bandits who would rob them of their goods.
Huangshan: I've accumulated a lot of experience from my years working in this field for — and I don't mind sharing.
(Obtain  Adventurer's Experience ×3)
 Goodbye.
Huangshan: Bye. I sense a certain confidence in you; we should team up some time.

Unreconciled Stars[]

Huangshan: Need a guard? It'll cost you extra, though. Unique times and everything.
Huangshan: The risks are high, after all. Meteorites are dropping from the sky — who knows what else might come down while we're at it?
