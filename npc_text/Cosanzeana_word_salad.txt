Dialogue[]

(Available after completing Were It So Easy)
Cosanzeana: Ah, are you here to see my flower garden today?
 How are our exotic flowers doing?
Cosanzeana: After the ugly machine got dug out, no bad Breacher Primuses returned to make a mess of things.
Cosanzeana: As such, my precious exotic flowers are growing healthily!
 How's your cultivation of new flowers proceeding?
Cosanzeana: ...To be honest, I don't know where to start just yet.
Cosanzeana: But if I can make the leaves of these flowers grow into the shape of Tidalga, I might be able to shock the world at the next horticultural fair!
(After Step 3 of There Will Come Soft Rains)
 About the earthquake just a while ago...
Cosanzeana: Th—That was so scary! Thankfully, my garden's alright...
Cosanzeana: I thought that some bad guys were coming to ruin it again... But I've got to protect the flowers we worked so hard to grow together!
 I'm just passing through...
Cosanzeana: Okay — I mean, cheering people up is one of the reasons for which flower gardens exist. I hope they'll be able to raise your spirits today, too!
