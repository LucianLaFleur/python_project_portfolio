Dialogue[]
During Equilibrium[]

Zhenhai: Welcome to the Jade Chamber, how may I be of service?
 Hello, who are you?
Zhenhai: I am Lady Ningguang's bodyguard. Traveler, what business brings you here?
 What can you tell me about Ningguang?
Zhenhai: Ah, so you're another one of those who wants to find out Lady Ningguang's secrets, are you? Unfortunately, I know no more than you do...
Zhenhai: Lady Ningguang has never been one to let her guards get too close. I'm only in this post in the first place thanks to my cousin.
Zhenhai: Baixiao pestered her about the idea constantly, and even then she only agreed to it reluctantly...
 ...Your cousin?
Zhenhai: Ahem! Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about!
Zhenhai: ...Shh, keep it to yourself, okay? If anyone asks, you heard nothing, and especially not from me!
 About physical training...
Zhenhai: Oh, are you interested in training, too? Perhaps we should find a place to do some sparring on one of my days off.
Zhenhai: Although my role in the Millelith is mostly an administrative one, I still prefer to stay fighting fit when I can.
Zhenhai: That's why I often take odd jobs that involve physical labor. A little extra muscle mass where it counts does wonders for one's appearance, don't you think?
 Goodbye.
Zhenhai: Take care, dear guest.

After Where the Heart Finds Rest[]

Zhenhai: Welcome to the Jade Chamber, how may I be of service?
 Hello there.
Zhenhai: I am Lady Ningguang's bodyguard.
Zhenhai: Well, that's my title, anyway. In practice, this is a clerical job roughly half the time.
Zhenhai: I was doing various odd jobs for a while, before being roped back in here to my old post once the Jade Chamber was restored.
 What can you tell me about Ningguang?
Zhenhai: Ah, so you're another one of those who wants to find out Lady Ningguang's secrets, are you? Unfortunately, I know no more than you do...
Zhenhai: Lady Ningguang has never been one to let her guards get too close. I'm only in this post in the first place thanks to my cousin.
