 What should I pick...
Media:VO Xugney 01.ogg "Hmm, it's so hard to pick the perfect gift."

Dialogue[]

Xugney: These... don't look good enough...
 Picking a gift?
Xugney: That's right! It's been a while since I've returned to Fontaine, so I'm trying to see what's new.
Xugney: Upon sailing to other nations, I found that their peoples quite admire our advanced machine industry — I must confess that I've grown quite proud of it myself.
Xugney: But the way I see it, these clockwork devices don't quite live up to the image they have in mind...
 How awesome do you need them to be?
Xugney: Like... the Gardemeks, I guess?
Xugney: Just kidding! Please don't call the Gardes.
Xugney: Hmm, but I do remember hearing that the Fontaine Research Institute was working on some new materials...
Xugney: Now, if that place hadn't blown sky-high, would a couple of anti-gravity hourglasses or floating transportation have truly been beyond them?
 Floating aquabuses...
Xugney: Oh, that's a capital idea. But if we had those, would we really need waterways?
Xugney: They're pretty convenient as-is — and speaking of that, I did have some dealings with Callas, the fellow who helped to build said waterways.
Xugney: It was thanks to him that I was able to make it as a shipborne merchant... Ah, what a shame...
Xugney: I wonder how his daughter, Navia, is doing. I should go say hello if I get the chance...
 Sorry for bothering you.
Xugney: No worries... Hmm, what should I pick...
