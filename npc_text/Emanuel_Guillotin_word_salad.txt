Profile[]
Emanuel was a member of the Narzissenkreuz Institute along with Basil Elton, Dwight Lasker and Karl Ingold. He also has superior combat skills, capable of defeating the Champion Duelist Marfisa.[2] Emanuel was lighthearted and carefree until the events of the Siege of Poisson,[2] after which he became cold-hearted and detached, as people reminded him that they too had "red blood" flowing within them.[3]

Appearance[]
Emanuel wore a mask known as the Veteran's Visage to hide the appalling scars on his face.

Story[]
Emanuel was raised alongside Basil Elton, Dwight Lasker and Karl Ingold at the Narzissenkreuz Institute. There, he often played games with them, taking on the role of the "hero" to fight against Karl, who played Jabberwock the evil dragon.[1]
Emanuel joined the Marechaussee Phantom in adulthood and directed the Siege of Poisson, an incident which potentially led to the deaths of Rene de Petrichor and Jakob Ingold's parents.[4] The bloodshed left both a physical and mental mark on Emanuel, and prompted him to retire.[3]
After retiring from the Marechaussee Phantom, Emanuel sank deep into alcoholism and disengaged himself from others. Anticipating a threat to the Narzissenkreuz Institute, Basil asked Emanuel to become the guardian of Alain and Mary-Ann before departing for battle. Emanuel reluctantly accepted her request and took the kids in, despite having no love for children and wishing to not associate himself with anyone. Although they never grew close, Emanuel became attached to the siblings over time.[3]
Dwight Lasker, the director of the Institute of Natural Philosophy and Emanuel's childhood friend, received a report one day regarding the Narzissenkreuz Ordo and their leader, referred to as the "Master".[5] He entrusted the investigation of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo to Emanuel,[6] who undertook it to protect his son and daughter.[7] However, he would become the first person to be dissolved by the Master; the Champion Duelist Marfisa, who had been tracking Emanuel, became the second. In his last moments, Emanuel recollected moments of his life, thinking back to his time in the Narzissenkreuz Institute and the events of the Siege of Poisson. He regretted his inability to become a competent father figure for the siblings before being dissolved and assimilated by the Master.[1]

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
Emanuel's surname, Guillotin, is derived from French doctor Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, who fought for using more humane methods of execution. This ultimately led to the development and usage of the guillotine, which came to be associated with him after he spoke in favor of it before France's National Assembly.
