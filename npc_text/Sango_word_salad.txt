 Bantan Sango Detective Agency...
Media:VO Sango 01.ogg "Welcome to Bantan Sango Detective Agency. What will you have me solve?"

Dialogue[]

Sango: Everything has its cause... And what cause brings you to Bantan Sango Detective Agency today?
 Tell me about the Bantan Sango Detective Agency...
Sango: As the name suggests, it's a detective agency that helps people figure out the truth behind cases.
Sango: Be it murder, banditry, extramarital affair investigations or pet searches... We can handle any trouble you may have, and I'm not making empty promises here.
Sango: Of course, the fees related to our services aren't going to be cheap. So it's best to have the payment ready before coming here.
Sango: Let me think. What else do I have to say... Oh, right. I also have a word of advice for you...
Sango: Emotion is the enemy of truth, and conscience the burden of knowledge. If you aren't ready to handle the truth, do not cross the threshold of wisdom lightly.
 I'm looking for someone.
Sango: A family member lost in an attack by an unknown deity... What an interesting case. It's definitely a worthwhile case for our agency.
Sango: Hmm... You obtained some clues from meeting them? That makes things easier. Tell me what you know then.
Sango: ...
Sango: ...Hey, come closer. Best not to let anyone eavesdrop on critical information.
 So, are you going out to investigate?
Sango: Well, gathering intelligence is Ryuuji's duty.
Sango: ...Huh? Me? Slack off? No way! Hmph, I think you just don't get it!
Sango: Analyzing clues is painstaking work. As the manager at the heart of everything, I just need to patiently wait for the incoming intelligence and analyze them.
 Goodbye.
Sango: Yeah, we'll meet again.

It's the one run by Sango and Ryuuji, right? Everyone speaks highly of them.(Traveler): Uh, I heard that they frequently get caught up in strange incidents, and some places have banned them from entering their premises...Paimon: Paimon thinks that's undeserved. After all, Sango and Ryuuji have helped a lot of people...(Traveler): Would you invite them if you were organizing a dinner party?(Traveler): What if halfway through the meal, one of the guests suddenly shrieked and collapsed onto the ground...Paimon: I—If that's the case, then Paimon thinks it's a bad idea. Paimon suddenly feels that hanging out with them could be dangerous...(Traveler): Well, that's the price you pay for being a famous detective.
