Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before step 5 of Deluge of Wrathful Waters.


Kosel: Huh? A new batch of goods? I'll get them moved, no problem.
 By new batch, you refer to...
Kosel: Huh? Relax, I was referring to normal cargo.
Kosel: Munaciello keeps saying that "information is cargo too" — and he's certainly succeeded in creating all sorts of unnecessary expectations of us porters.
Kosel: Don't listen to his claptrap — we should all just do what we should.
 Uh, that's not it...
Kosel: Oh, so you're a guest here.
Kosel: Alright then. Just call me if you need anything.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after step 5 of Deluge of Wrathful Waters.


Kosel: Hello. The goods we're transporting have to pass right through here. Careful not to get hit.
 When you say goods...
Kosel: Supplies for disaster relief and reconstruction.
Kosel: Some are from the Snezhnayans, others from Ms. Clorinde.
Kosel: The Boss has already given instructions. I'll take care of these, no need to bother you.
 Understood.
Kosel: Mm-hmm.

Dialogue Set #3[]
Available after Condition missing.


Kosel: Huh? A new shipment of goods? I'll get them moved, right away.
 By new shipment, you mean...
Kosel: Huh? Relax, I meant normal goods.
Kosel: Munaciello used to keep saying that "information is a type of good too." That certainly succeeded in creating all sorts of unnecessary expectations of us porters.
Kosel: Now that we can't hear his nagging anymore... being a porter is a boring profession once again.
 Uh, that's not it...
Kosel: Oh, so you're a customer.
Kosel: Alright, then. Just call me if you need anything.
