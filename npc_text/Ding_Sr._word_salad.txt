 Tea leaves...
Media:VO Ding Sr. 01.ogg "With tea leaves, you gotta have good quality control in place."

Dialogue[]

Ding Sr.: Are you here for a tour? It's nice that you're interested in tea, and you'll learn all about it here!
 What is this place?
Ding Sr.: This is the Qiaoying Village tea workshop. Most of the tea leaves are sent here after being picked.
Ding Sr.: You might not realize that tea leaves require several processes and careful handling before they can be used to make tea.
Ding Sr.: Simply put, we need to remove the excess moisture in the leaves to deepen their fragrance and make them easier to store.
Ding Sr.: Our workshop's in charge of sunning, baking, and then stirring them in a pan.
Ding Sr.: Some types are then taken back by the tea farmers for additional processing, such as piling and fermenting.
Ding Sr.: If you have time, you should stay in the village for a month or so. That way, you can see the full process, from leaf picking to the moment the tea's served up on tables.
 What's the machine in that room over there?
Ding Sr.: Ah, you're asking about the stirring machine, yes? Compared to our village's history, the machine is very young.
Ding Sr.: We used to use a huge tea cauldron for stirring. They said it was an adeptal mechanism of some sort...
Ding Sr.: The traditional process creates a traditional flavor, but we must also meet the quantity demands, so these days our workshop uses new, faster machines.
Ding Sr.: That said, with higher efficiency and more heat, the need to ensure quality is even greater.
Ding Sr.: That's why people like me, with more than thirty years of experience, are needed to make sure things don't go wrong.
Ding Sr.: As for Ding Jr... He's got another decade of buckling down and learning this craft ahead, that's for sure...
 Goodbye.
Ding Sr.: Farewell! Come back when you have time. Who knows, maybe you'd be interested in becoming one of us!

(Trample the tea leaves in the center of the room)
Ding Sr.: Hey, kiddo. Why is someone who looks as nice as you causing so much trouble?
Ding Sr.: This basket is filled with tea leaves that are being dried, not weeds. They're treasures meant for everyone's teacups.
Ding Sr.: Don't do something like this again, or Uncle Luo will be furious if he sees you...
Ding Sr.: He might even evict you from Qiaoying Village altogether!
