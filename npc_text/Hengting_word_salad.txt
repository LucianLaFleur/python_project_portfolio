 Gotta work harder...
Media:VO Hengting 01.ogg "Gotta improve the quality of my tea leaves somehow if I wanna be able to sell them."

Dialogue[]

Hengting: *sigh* I can't spend my whole life growing mass-market tea, can I...
Hengting: That stuff's often poured as the first cup for a customer who's just sat down. Hardly any difference between that and a cup of water.
Hengting: If that's all my effort amounts to, then what's the point?
Aige: Is it really that bad? Did your master say something again?
Hengting: Two days ago, he said I was good enough to strike out on my own. But I had a feeling that he meant I was a gone case.
Hengting: He didn't even look at me when he said those things.
Aige: Um, perhaps you're overthinking this...
Aige: Your master's always been strict with his students. He would never let someone sub-par go independent and ruin his reputation!
Aige: Maybe he didn't say anything because he thinks you're completely ready, which is why nothing more needs to be said.
Hengting: Could that really be?
Aige: And there's no hurry either, is there? You've been doing this for, what? Less than ten years? It would be unrealistic to expect to surpass the masters right away!
Aige: Given our age, it's normal to be far from being masters of our respective professions.
Aige: The tea baskets I weave look pretty ordinary, right? I think it's better that way. At least I'm not too stressed out about my job.
Hengting: I'm just glad you're not always tired. But I won't be satisfied with growing "ordinary" tea!
Hengting: I need to think of something to improve the quality.
Aige: How about our trip? Is that getting delayed again?
Hengting: Let's await the second harvest. If the quality improves, then we'll travel!
Aige: And if it doesn't?
Hengting: Then we wait for another harvest, of course!
