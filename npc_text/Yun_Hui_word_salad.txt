Story[]
Yun Hui lived through the cataclysm five hundred years ago. After it subsided, monsters still ran rampant throughout Teyvat, and people turned to supernatural arts to combat them. However, weapon production techniques were antiquated and the weapons they created broke easily.[2] In response, Yun Hui collaborated with Han Wu, another famous weaponsmith, to create the Prototype Series weapons.
At one point in time, Yun Hui helped Han Wu gather a crew to go to The Chasm and mine crystallized blackcliff, a rare type of ore. However, a cave-in trapped Han Wu and his men there for an unknown time. After Han Wu managed to break free, he emerged a changed man.[3]
