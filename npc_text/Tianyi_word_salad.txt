Dialogue[]

Tianyi: Hello there, Traveler!
 Why, hello.
Tianyi: If you're here on important business, please look for our director, Muning. But if you don't have any key purpose here, please leave The Chasm.
Tianyi: I apologize for being brusque, but I really haven't the time for too much idle chit-chat.
 Goodbye.
Tianyi: See you. Please take care!
