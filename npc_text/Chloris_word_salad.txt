 What plant is this...

Dialogue[]

Chloris: Wow! I haven't had any faunal contact in ages!
 Can you sell me some plants?
Chloris: Of course. Unlike Flora's flower shop, we sell all plants here. We do not discriminate.
 ...Faunal contact?
Chloris: My name's Chloris! I'm the best botanist in Mondstadt.
Chloris: I spend all my days out in the wild, among the flora. Fauna, on the other hand, are somewhat lacking in my life.
Chloris: So you can always feel free to talk to me. I'd appreciate the company!
 What about your family?
Chloris: You might know my little sister, Flora?
Chloris: All she cares about is flowers. She runs a flower shop in the city.
Chloris: I'm much more open-minded than she is. I care about all plants, especially strange new ones!
Chloris: I guess I am the older one, after all. I do think Flora really could do better if she pushed herself...
 Sorry to disturb you.
Chloris: Hey! You're just saying that to make me feel bad. You're awful!
 Goodbye.
Chloris: Wha— You're leaving already?

Trivia[]
