Dialogue[]

Clemens: I'm a winemaker from Sailing Breeze. I came to this market specifically to purchase ingredients.
Clemens: You haven't heard of us at all? Heh, that's no surprise. We're an old brand, but we primarily do business overseas these days. We don't even have a shop in Mondstadt anymore.
Clemens: We can't compete with Dawn Winery, but Sailing Breeze has made quite a name for itself in Inazuma.
Clemens: That girl Karpillia was so desperate to expand into the overseas market, but it was the right call in the end.
Clemens: Thanks to her, my skills can still be put to good use even now.
