Dialogue[]

Qiongjiu: I don't think I've seen you before... Did you come from Yilong Wharf? Do you know how to make jadeware?
 Well, I really don't...
Qiongjiu: Oh... What a pity. That's the most interesting thing in the world.
Qiongjiu: *sigh* If only I could reel some in while fishing...
 Why would you even think that...
Qiongjiu: If I could fish up some jade while fishing, then I could play with Muli every day...
Qiongjiu: Even though fishing is fun, making jadeware is more interesting still.
Qiongjiu: But if I don't put in the effort and practice fishing as my family wants, my parents' techniques will be lost forever.
Qiongjiu: If only Little Mao was willing to learn how to fish...
 See you.
Qiongjiu: Well then, goodbye.
