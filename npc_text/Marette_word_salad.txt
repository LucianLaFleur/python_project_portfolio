Dialogue[]

Marette: Hmm... Oh! Hello. Can I help you with something?
 Hello.
Marette: Oh, it's you. I remember you, and your little friend as well. You're the ones the Iudex personally had escorted over here. You don't see that every day.
(Before completing Step 4 of Deluge of Wrathful Waters)

Marette: Okay... Your registration information is all squared away. Try not to make any waves until you complete your sentence, okay?
(After completing Step 4 of Deluge of Wrathful Waters)

Marette: Let's see here... Your files have been updated. Congratulations, consider your sentence officially served. You're free to go back to a place where the sun shines brightly and live your life as you see fit.
 Sorry to bother you.
Marette: Have... *yawn*... Have a nice day...
