Jani is a student from the Sumeru Akademiya who was reported by Ilyas for academic fraud, which lead to the events of Alhaitham's Story Quest Vultur Volans Chapter: Act I - The Illusions of the Mob.

Profile[]
In flashbacks of Ilyas' past in Pride and Prejudice in Alhaitham's Story Quest, Vultur Volans Chapter: Act I - The Illusions of the Mob, it is stated how Jani had used Raju's thesis to send in a project application which was approved; in exchange, Jani gave Raju a measly 20,000 Mora. Many students joined this project, including Janaki and Jaap. Seeing how many people would be affected had he spoken out against Jani, Raju kept quiet, as he also wished to graduate without any problems. In spite of that, however, Jani would both threaten Raju and consult the latter whenever the project hit a roadblock, leading Raju to be overworked without proper compensation. This proves too much for Raju to handle, and he commits suicide.
Due to Raju's death, Jani was reported for academic fraud by Ilyas and was put on trial by the Matra, halting the project and jeopardizing the graduations of those who participated. This would lead to Ilyas being shunned and ostracized by other researchers despite his heroism, leading him to accept an offer from Siraj to "merge into a collective."
