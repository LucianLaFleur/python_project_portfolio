Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Uncle Anpu: Hello. Is there anything you need from me?
 Tell me a bit about yourself...
Uncle Anpu: I've been the head of Aaru Village for a long time now. If anything happens, just come find me.
Uncle Anpu: Food, lodgings... Whatever I can help with, I will, to the best of my abilities.
Uncle Anpu: Also, if you encounter loose sands or abnormally strong winds out there in the desert, it's safer if you take shelter in the village as soon as possible.
Uncle Anpu: ...Well, these don't always guarantee that a sandstorm will follow, but it never hurts to be careful...
Uncle Anpu: Haha, would you look at that? I'm getting long-winded in my old age. Please don't mind me, youngster, hehe...
 Thanks for the reminder.
Uncle Anpu: Good, good, as long as I got through to you.
Uncle Anpu: I've seen many a reckless soul run into trouble out in the desert. It's very saddening.
Uncle Anpu: Of course, having the daring to challenge danger is a good thing, but you can't simply ignore danger altogether.
(Obtain  Adventurer's Experience ×4)
 Hello there, Uncle Anpu.
(After completing King Deshret and the Three Magi)
Uncle Anpu: Ah, it's you! How have you been?
Uncle Anpu: Isak mentioned you to me earlier. Said that he wanted to thank you properly.
Uncle Anpu: That kid's fond of you — I can tell. You're quite the example to him.
Uncle Anpu: A good thing, of course. Always good to see children be enthusiastic and hardworking. Always glad to see that.
Uncle Anpu: If you aren't going to be too busy in the next couple of days, perhaps you might want to rest your feet here. Aaru Village will always welcome you.
 See you.
Uncle Anpu: Goodbye. Stay safe.

Nighttime[]

Uncle Anpu: My old pal, what do you think? When we're too old to remember anything, will there be any young people willing to take our places?
Belkacem: Of course! Don't say things like that.
Belkacem: Our village may be small, but we've got quite a lot of decent youngsters here.
Belkacem: Never mind the people who came back from working with the Eremites, even Kazim's boy is working hard, you know?
Uncle Anpu: Ah, true, true. You're right. I must've been overthinking.
Uncle Anpu: I'm sure we'll have more reliable successors like Candace in our village.
Belkacem: Of course! Speaking of Candace, remember when she was a little girl?
Belkacem: How she'd go to the wrong house because of her poor eyesight?
Uncle Anpu: ... Yes, yes. That did happen, I believe. Hah, between the two of us, I guess you're the one with good memory...
