Dialogue[]

Bahram: Selling things here is a pursuit of leisure.
 How's the business going?
Bahram: It's enough to make the ends meet.
Bahram: This is a key area on the river path to Sumeru, so many caravans pass through all year round.
Bahram: But you can travel along the river to Port Ormos, so few merchants would stay here.
Bahram: But it's also a good thing. Fewer merchants, less competition, you know.
 See you.
Bahram: Take care.
