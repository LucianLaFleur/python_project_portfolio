Dialogue[]

Rashnu: The Vourukasha Oasis is nice, but Barsom is good too...
 About Barsom...
Rashnu: It's a peaceful place, well-suited for getting some good sleep.
Rashnu: ...Pari sleep differently from humans.
Rashnu: Sleep helps you... Hmm... focus your senses on what the roots and branches say.
 About the Kory Drums...
Rashnu: A human instrument. One that's extremely noisy.
 I won't bother you anymore.
Rashnu: *snore*
After completing The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 2)
Rashnu: *snore*... *snore*... *snore*? Hmm? Ah, you're the ones who are with Sorush...
 Were you sleeping?
Rashnu: Sleep is also a duty...
Rashnu: The Vourukasha Oasis is a wonderful place. It has been some time since I was here, but all still seems familiar.
 About Sorush...
Rashnu: To wake me only for something so important... I have already forgiven her.
Rashnu: The credit for extinguishing the Sign of Apaosha belongs to Sorush... along with all those that helped her.
Rashnu: Though the situation might not be as she expected, I think the present circumstances are better.
 I won't bother you anymore.
Rashnu: *snore*...
