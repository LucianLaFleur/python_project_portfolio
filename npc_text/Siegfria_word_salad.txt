Dialogue[]

Siegfria: Need to make a delivery? I deliver to the city.
 Who are you?
Siegfria: My name's Siegfria. I work odd jobs doing deliveries back and forth between Mondstadt and Springvale.
Siegfria: When there's no jobs going, I pick wild vegetables and trade them for a bit of meat with the hunting guys.
Siegfria: I figure that even hunters can't eat meat every single day of their lives, so everyone's happy.
 You seem to have a keen interest in food.
Siegfria: Keen interest? Hmm... I wouldn't go that far... I just need to eat to live!
Siegfria: I spend every last Mora I make on food; adding in some wild vegetables and the occasional show of support from a kind hunter, I still end each day feeling like there hasn't quite been enough to eat.
Siegfria: And then as soon as I start working, I get even more hungry...
 Goodbye.
Siegfria: Look after yourself.
