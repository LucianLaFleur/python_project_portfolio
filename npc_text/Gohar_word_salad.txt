Profile[]
Gohar is a well-known and popular individual at Caravan Ribat. Safie describes her as "a beautiful lady that everyone here in Caravan Ribat likes."
Some weeks before the Traveler visits Caravan Ribat, Gohar received a letter via Dusk Bird to meet someone — ostensibly her lover[1] — in Sumeru City. She immediately departed for the city and was escorted by the Eremite mercenary Safie.[2]
Meanwhile, Vikram sent Baharak to pass on an identical message to Gohar; by the time Baharak arrived, she learned that Gohar had received the message and was no longer in Caravan Ribat, leaving her to wonder whether she had made a mistake somewhere.[3]

Trivia[]
According to a message on the Akademiya Public Message Board,[4] Vikram is married, and Hawad says that she traveled to Sumeru City to find her lover. This makes it possible that Vikram and Gohar are lovers, although this cannot be confirmed based on current information.
