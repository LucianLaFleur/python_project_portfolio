Arasaka's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Arasaka and his "family" met the Traveler's Sibling sometime before the cataclysm, where he and his brothers became interested in cooking after watching them cook. However, they quickly ended up arguing and were kicked out of Vanarana by Arapacati, where they went their separate ways.
Arasaka later befriended Iaanesh in his youth, where they enjoyed sugar, which he considered the "taste of happiness." Wanting to replicate the taste to his family, he sought to find it again while taking care of a Zaytun Peach crop. After the Traveler discovered the Aranara, they were tasked by Arapacati to find her brothers to begin Festival Utsava.
The Traveler found Arasaka near Gandharva Ville, where he was taking care of a Zaytun Peach crop. However, he was too obsessed with the crop, so the Traveler attempted to pick the peaches to get his attention. After realizing they were a good Nara, he agreed to return to Vanarana if they could bring him the "taste of happiness," which he described as white and crumbly. The Traveler managed to find Arasaka's friend and acquired the item, sugar.
Returning to Arasaka, he thanked them for bringing the sugar and made his dish of overly sweetened peaches. He gave the recipe to them, which Paimon managed to salvage as a more appealing Selva Salad.
Once the brothers returned to Vanarana, they were all scolded by Arapacati. When the festival began, the Traveler gave Arasaka and the others some Radish Veggie Soup, although Arasaka did not enjoy it, claiming that the "taste of happiness" was fleeing from him.

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Available during An Unwavering Culinary Dream)
Arasaka: I—I now just have to let them taste this Supreme Delicacy and they will understand what the "taste of happiness" is.
Arasaka: Arapacati will surely like it...

Dialogue Set #2[]

(Available after An Unwavering Culinary Dream)
Arasaka: Thank you, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). It is because of your help that everyone can enjoy "the taste of happiness" at Festival Utsava.
 About Festival Utsava...
Arasaka: The more friends to share the "taste of happiness" with, the better it becomes. So when Festival Utsava comes, I will make sure every Aranara gets to have a "taste of happiness."
Arasaka: By then... I think Arapacati will have a good time like everyone else.
 About the "taste of happiness"...
Arasaka: Besides the "taste of happiness," there is also the "taste of sadness."
Arasaka: It's a terrible salty taste, which makes you very sad even with just a small bite.
Arasaka: But Nara seem to like the "taste of sadness." I don't understand this.
Arasaka: Could it be that sharing the "taste of sadness" feels happy, too?
 Goodbye.
Arasaka: It's the taste of happiness! I can feel the happiness!

Dialogue Set #3[]

(Available after "Hello," "Thank You," and the Final "Goodbye")
Arasaka: Ah, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! Have you heard of the "taste of anger"?
 The "taste of anger"?
Arasaka: That taste, Nara Varuna once brought it up.
Arasaka: A taste of it would make you feel as if swallowed the flame of Vanagni. Eeek! Even the thought of it is terrifying.
Arasaka: But some Nara like that taste. They must be the bravest Nara among all.
Arasaka: Brave Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) must like "the taste of anger," no?
 I like it.
Arasaka: Oh, so all brave Nara like the "taste of anger."
Arasaka: Alright, in the future "special cooking training," I will give the "taste of anger" a try. Hope... it doesn't hurt too much.
 I don't like it.
Arasaka: Hmm... So not every brave Nara likes the "taste of anger"...
Arasaka: In the future "special cooking training," I will try to find the taste that brave Nara likes.
 I have things to tend to...
Arasaka: Oh... Let Arasaka know when you're all set then.
