Profile[]
Pursina studied at Sumeru Akademiya and was particularly knowledgeable in the field of ley lines. They invented a device known as Pursina's Spikes, which are capable of temporarily disrupting the flow of ley lines.[2]
Recently, another Pursina authored the Yae Publishing House's latest rendition of The Saga of Hamavaran, a series about the adventures of a Sumeru-Akademiya-researcher-turned-samurai named Hamavaran and a shikigami he met on his journey.[3]

Trivia[]
The creator of Pursina's Spikes and the author of The Saga of Hamavaran are unlikely to be the same person, but neither have been given personal names to distinguish them. Pursina's Spikes are described as "ancient tools"[1] that were "allowed to waste away in our [Sumeru Akademiya's] storehouses." Hosseini contemplates researching Pursina's Spikes as a thesis subject,[4] which further suggests that the inventor of Pursina's Spikes is no longer alive to be able to explain how their device works. Meanwhile, the Pursina who wrote The Saga of Hamavaran is a contemporary figure whose series was published after the Sakoku Decree was implemented.[3]
In the original Chinese version, both the historical Pursina and the author Pursina's names are spelled 普尔希娜 Pǔ'ěrxīnà, which uses the female-exclusive phonetic character 娜 nà instead of the genderless 纳 nà used by Khedive Pursina (海迪夫・普尔希纳 Hǎidífū Pǔ'ěrxīnà), a modern-day male descendant of the Pursinas. (It is also possible that there are two independent Pursina lineages, but the similarities between the two versions makes it likelier to be two spellings for the same lineage.)
Etymology[]
Pursina (Persian: پورسینا) is a patrynomic of Persian origin meaning "Son of Sina," where پور Pur means "son" and سینا Sina is a given name. The name is likely a reference to Avicenna Ibn Sina, or Pur Sina (پور سینا), a famous Persian polymath during the Islamic Golden Age who was named after his distant ancestor Sina.
