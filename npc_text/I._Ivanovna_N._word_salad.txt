Profile[]
I. Ivanovna never had any magic or combat training, and was "simply ordinary" in comparison to other members of the Hexenzirkel.[6] She had a lineage of successors and followers, although none of them were acknowledged by Hexenzirkel Elder Alice until Scarlett.[2]
In The Mages' Tea Party cutscene, I. Ivanovna is represented at the tea party with a pink teacup, with rose and thorn motifs in the background.[7]

Appearance[]
I. Ivanovna is depicted as a light-haired woman wearing a red dress. Later in The Mages' Tea Party cutscene, she is also represented by a woman with wavy, floor-length hair and a large witch's hat.[7]

Story[]
At some point in her life, I. Ivanovna fell in love with a man and decided to leave the Hexenzirkel after marrying. The day before she was going to be married, Alice, Barbeloth, Andersdotter, Nicole, and Rhinedottir sent her a letter containing a "prophecy," which was actually a request for her to see them again. It can be assumed that she communicated with them using a Lantern of Utmost Joy. Eventually, I. Ivanovna's husband grew old and fell gravely ill, so she ended his life to ease him of his suffering, and related the experience to her fellow witches the following day.[2][7]
During her tenure of mayor, she requested Alice to help her settle various trifling matters in Snezhnaya. In exchange, Alice asked I. Ivanovna to write a fortune slip for Andersdotter.[6]
Although I. Ivanovna passed away centuries ago, she passed her title onto her students and followers. Her most recent successor, Scarlett, had the prophecy which the Hexenzirkel members had written and sought to uncover information about it, leading to the events of Windblume Festival.[2]

Trivia[]
Based on her name and her position as the first mayor, I. Ivanovna might have been born in Snezhnaya.
I. Ivanovna wrote Vol. 4 of The Little Witch and the Undying Fire.
Etymology[]
Ivanovna (Russian: Ивановна) is a patronymic and means "daughter of Ivan."
