Dialogue[]

Komaki: How do you do, youngster?
 Hi there, Granny Komaki!
Komaki: Haha, it's so good to see you all again. Might you be interested in a little fortune-telling next time if you get the chance?
 About Bourou Village...
Komaki: Oh? You're asking about the village?
Komaki: There's not much to be said about it. It is simply the place where we have lived over many generations.
Komaki: It's just that this place has experienced far more history than many others... But not as much as Sangonomiya Shrine, of course...
 About the Spiritherbs...
Komaki: Thanks to your help, it's growing very well...
Komaki: But I think that it will need some rest before it can regain its efficacy again, haha...
Komaki: It is a fine year, and wishes in the waters have been very rich indeed. I believe that they will only get better...
 See you, Granny.
Komaki: Alright, go well. Come again soon!
