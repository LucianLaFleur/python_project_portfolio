Media:VO Farhad All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Farhad: (Work is so boring. I hope the theater will put on a new show soon.)
Dialogue[]

Farhad: When the first public performance debuts, I'll be the first to buy a ticket.
 What public performance?
Farhad: It's the new play that Mr. Zubayr's working on.
Farhad: Unsurprisingly, Miss Nilou will definitely be featured in it.
Farhad: Plays at Zubayr Theater never disappoint. Every time a new production is out, researchers all rush over and grab tickets, no matter what research they have.
Farhad: You should definitely check them out.
 See you.
Farhad: Bye!

Dialogue Set #1[]

Media:vo xmaq005 13 farhad 01.ogg Farhad: Things are really shaping up, and there's a buzz around the festival this year. We're expecting people from all over to come by this year and buy things during the festivities.
Media:vo xmaq005 13 farhad 02.ogg Farhad: Don't be fooled into thinking that Sumeru City has the best of everything. Some festival snacks are only offered here in the Grand Bazaar.
Media:vo xmaq005 13 farhad 03.ogg Farhad: And when it comes to musicians, dancers, or singers, the Grand Bazaar's got the best of the best! Sure, those folks at the Akademiya might not like it, but what's a festival without song and dance?

Dialogue Set #2[]

Farhad: Though work is as boring as ever and Zubayr Theater has no new showings, there seems to be no shortage of prospects as of late!
Farhad: Say, friend, are you going to watch the Interdarshan Championship? I hear Miss Nilou's going to be commentating!
Farhad: I wasn't much of a student growing up. Felt like I had an allergy to learning. However, after listening to how Miss Nilou breaks things down, the knowledge seems a lot easier for me to grasp.
Farhad: If you missed Miss Nilou's commentary, it's your loss.
