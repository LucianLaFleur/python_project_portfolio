Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Master Hui: If only I could open up another uncut rock! The next one will surely be the real deal. I can feel it!
Master Hui: If it wasn't for Xi, right now, I'd be...
 Uncut rocks?
Master Hui: Huh, are you also interested in betting on rocks? Then you've come to the right man. Let me tell you how it's done!
Master Hui: You cannot judge the value of these stones based on their outward face. A real expert also knows how to use their nose!
Master Hui: This is deep water indeed. I would say that even with my prodigious talents, it took me at least eight years of practice to really grasp the technique.
 So, have you struck gold?
Master Hui: Well... I've just been unlucky!
Master Hui: If it wasn't for Xi's constant nagging that my father was coming to catch me, which affected my judgment... I would definitely have figured it out!
Master Hui: See, I would have chosen that yellow one! And if I had, would I still be in this state now?
 Well, about Xi the Maid...
Master Hui: Don't bring her into this. I may have lost my bet at The Jade Mystery over a hundred times, but this is what they call gaining experience... was there ever a venture that was all gain and no loss, anyway?
Master Hui: But my stubborn old man wouldn't listen. He booted me out in a fit of pique!
Master Hui: At least Mother understood me, and sent Xi after me with some traveling expenses.
Master Hui: ...But she only ever gives me a little every day. I have to save for half a month before I can open one stone!
Master Hui: Hmph. Well, no matter. Soon, I will be back in the saddle... no, I shall be on the rise!
 Well, best of luck then.
Master Hui: Thank you! Once my luck turns, watch me buy over the entire Wangshu Inn!
Master Hui: ...Then I'll make Xi clean every single plate in the inn. That'll show her.
