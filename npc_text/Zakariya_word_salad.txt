Dialogue[]

Zakariya: Hello. How can I help you?
 What is this place?
Zakariya: The Bimarstan provides free medical treatments from the Akademiya to the people. The doctors here are all researchers and students from the same institute. No matter your social status, everyone can bask in the glow of the Healing.
Zakariya: The Healing is what the sages realized with guidance from the gods.
Zakariya: At least, that's what's written in the Doctor's Manual.
 Not at the moment.
Zakariya: May you be in good health.
