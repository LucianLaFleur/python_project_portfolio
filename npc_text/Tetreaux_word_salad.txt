 Just say what you mean.
Media:VO Tetreaux 01.ogg "Just say what you mean. No problem's too big to solve."

Dialogue[]

Tetreaux: Got a problem? I can solve it for you.
 Can you solve any problem?
Tetreaux: Theoretically, I do not believe there is any problem that can only be solved by force.
Tetreaux: When we of the Spina di Rosula act, I'm certain that we'll be able to resolve your issue with minimal harm.
Tetreaux: From things as small as living supplies and household affairs, to matters as large as factional disputes and savings... the Spina will do all it can for you.
 Sorry for bothering you.
Tetreaux: Consider it no bother — we all help each other here.

Beware of them — they each have their own agenda, and they're not all friendly like us. If you ever find yourself in a tight spot, you can always ask Mr. Tetreaux at the bar for help. Unless you're dealing with someone who isn't in the mood to sit down and have a conversation, in which case... White Glove will sort things out. You can count on him.
