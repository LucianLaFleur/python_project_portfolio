Dialogue[]

Onoda: Boss, judging from the situation around here, this place must be the center of the battlefield... Maybe we should just get out of this place...
Miura: Huh? What are you, a coward? To be a Treasure Hoarder, you must have both skills and guts! The items left behind on the battlefield will sell for a good price, you hear?
Onoda: But what if we run into the people from the Shogunate or the resistance [sic]?
Miura: C'mon, that's easy! Listen, whoever we run into, you just tell them that we're with them.
Miura: You lied through your teeth just fine when you told your girlfriend that you had come here to serve. What's the matter with you now?
Onoda: Well... that lie had nothing to do with our safety. This is totally different...
Onoda: Boss, I still say we should just grab some valuables now and head back soon...
