Dialogue[]

Yuan Rong: Gather round, gather round! If you're passing by, don't pass this up: Introducing the amazing Shadow Lantern!
 I'll give it a go!
Yuan Rong: No problem! I hope the Shadow Lantern shows you something truly spectacular.

 What's this Shadow Lantern business?
Yuan Rong: It's a simple new invention of mine — all you have to do is rotate the objects inside the Shadow Lantern, get all the shadows to merge in a certain way, and the most incredible images will be revealed before your very eyes.
Yuan Rong: Intrigued? You should try it out for yourself! It's set up right here — please, peruse and use at your leisure.
 See you.
Yuan Rong: Alright. If you've got the time, come back and give the Shadow Lantern a go!
