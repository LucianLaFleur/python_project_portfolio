Dialogue[]

Javad: Ouch...
 Are you hurting badly?
Javad: It does hurt pretty bad, but I'm used to it.
Javad: Even the best doctor couldn't do anything with my affliction, so I don't have any high hopes.
Javad: Compared to griping and living in fear, it's better to be upbeat and charitable.
 Get some rest.
Javad: I appreciate your kindness, but life has to go on.
Javad: I'd trade a few years of my life for not having to drink such bitter medicines every day!
