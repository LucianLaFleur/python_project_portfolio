Dialogue[]

Ashshab: *sigh* I asked Mr. Hazm about my term paper and got just a glare from him again...
Jaleh: Was it the same question you asked him about last time?
Ashshab: Yeah, I have adjusted the lighting conditions, but I still can't get the desired outcome.
Ashshab: When I asked him, he just said something like "You ran too far. You should go back and check!"...
Ashshab: But as I've confirmed over and over again, the original idea couldn't meet the requirement on the fruits' sweetness.
Jaleh: I think you might have misunderstood...
Jaleh: Is it possible that there's something wrong with your projections?
Ashshab: Huh? Are you saying it was all wrong from the start!?
