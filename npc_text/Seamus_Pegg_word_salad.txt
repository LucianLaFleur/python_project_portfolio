Profile[]
Seamus Pegg was once an adventurer, famed throughout Teyvat. When he came to Mondstadt, he started anew with the Church of Favonius and later rose to the position of Seneschal. He fell in love with Frederica Gunnhildr of the prestigious Gunnhildr Clan; they married and had two daughters, Jean and Barbara. The two eventually separated and Barbara stayed with him.[2] Despite their separation, he still kept Frederica's set of clothes as the Alder Knight, Gunnhildr's Legacy, around.[4]
His current duties and responsibilities have been entrusted and handed over to Cardinal Calvin, as he departed for an expedition with Grand Master Varka.[3] The purpose of the expedition is unknown, but is "related to a dangerous secret from days long past."[5]

Story[]
Manga[]
Seamus first appears in Chapter 1, attending the Ludi Harpastum festivities at Diluc Manor. When Il Dottore and Krupp demand an audience with him, Seamus shows himself. The three of them, as well as Diluc and Kaeya, head to the Dawn Winery's meeting room to talk about the Fatui's desire to recruit people from Mondstadt.[6]
Although unwilling to give into the Fatui's demands, Seamus was unable to find a way to tip negotiations in Mondstadt's favor. While deliberating on their next move, however, Dottore lost interest in Mondstadt after finding another object of greater interest — Diluc's Delusion — and ordered his diplomats to withdraw. Seamus, after learning that Dottore had left first, gets drunk and excitedly tells Kaeya the news.[7]

In-Game[]
Because Varka's expedition, which Seamus is a member of, departed from Mondstadt before the start of the Archon Quests, Seamus has not made a proper appearance in the story. When attempting to retrieve the Holy Lyre der Himmel, Gotelinde tells the Traveler that a signed document from the Seneschal is one of the items required to borrow the artifact, and has optional dialogue where she mentions that Seamus is away.[8]
During the event Of Ballads and Brews, Varka sends a letter to the Knights of Favonius with a status update, reassuring that all members of the expedition are alive and accounted for.[5]

Trivia[]
A seneschal is a senior position filled by a court appointment within a royal, ducal, or noble household during the Middle Ages and early Modern period — historically a steward or majordomo of a medieval great house.
Seamus Pegg was originally named "Seamus" in the manga and "Seamus Pegg" in the Closed Beta Test versions of Jean and Barbara's character stories. For Version 1.0, he was renamed to "Simon Page," but it was reverted to "Seamus Pegg" in Version 1.4.
In Korean, he was renamed accordingly from 시몬 페이지 Simon Peiji to 시무스・페그 Simuseu Pegeu,[1][2] but this change was not reflected in Barbara's Hangout Event.[3]
His name remains unchanged in Chinese (西蒙・佩奇 Xīméng Pèiqí), Japanese (サイモン・ペッチ Saimon Pecchi), and French (Seamus Page).
In Japanese, his name is inconsistently localized as サイモン・ペイジ Saimon Peiji in Barbara's Hangout Event.[3] It is unknown which one is correct.
