Profile[]
He was a good friend and close traveling companion of Kazuha's. Kazuha explained to the Traveler that one day, his friend asked about a sword art of which he had heard, the "Musou no Hitotachi." Kazuha told the friend that it could only be witnessed when "divine punishment" is administered and that it was the pinnacle of the Raiden Shogun's skill, a symbol of ultimate power. Kazuha's friend believed that there must be one who could withstand it, and that "there would always be those who dare to brave the lightning's glow."

Story[]
While fleeing from the Vision Hunt Decree, Kazuha had heard that his friend had challenged the Vision Hunters to a duel before the throne. Kazuha's friend dueled with Kujou Sara, who had accepted the duel on Beelzebul's behalf in Tenshukaku, where the defeated would face divine punishment from the Raiden Shogun. When Kazuha arrived, the duel was over and his friend had lost. Kazuha ran away with his friend's dying vision in his hand.[3]

Legacy[]
Kazuha would later try to find someone to resonate with his friend's Masterless Vision, even asking Beidou to host the annual Crux Clash with it as a reward. Unfortunately, no one, not even the Traveler, was able to resonate with it. Kazuha then spent some time roaming Liyue to see if anyone was able to, but he was unable to find anyone before being recalled to the Crux for the trip to Inazuma.
In a cutscene during the Archon Quest The Omnipresent God, Kazuha is seen wearing his friend's Masterless Vision next to his own Anemo Vision. When the Traveler leaves Tenshukaku and was immediately attacked by the Shogun (despite saying they could leave the place alive), the Masterless Vision returns to its original state as his friend's words echo again: "There will always be those who dare to brave the lightning's glow." This second Vision allows Kazuha to harness both the power of Anemo and Electro at once, which he uses to successfully block the Shogun's attack, saving the Traveler. The Electro Vision is then sent flying by the Shogun's blade, falling to the floor and deactivating once again.
As many people were unaware of the Masterless Vision and many Inazumans revered the Shogun, they believed that it was simply inconceivable or that he had used a Delusion due to eye-witnesses seeing him use both Anemo and Electro.[4] Word of the feat also caught up to Scaramouche, now reformed into the Wanderer, who was amused and impressed by the feat.[5]

Broken Blade Mound[]
His sword can be found in a small ravine north-east of the Grand Narukami Shrine. In the ending cinematic of The Omnipresent God, Kazuha can be seen placing his friend's Masterless Vision next to the sword. After completing The Omnipresent God, the Masterless Vision can be seen near the mound, along with a Sapphire cat.
The blade may be interacted with:

Broken Blade Mound: The thunder incinerates body and bone — in nourishing the earth may they both find rest.

Do I simply resent the Raiden Shogun because of what happened in that duel? Because of the lethal stroke she dealt my dear friend? I've thought about this a good long time, and I believe the answer is no. My friend died an honorable death in that duel, and the Shogun was not unjustified in her conduct. My dissatisfaction with her has its roots in the Vision Hunt Decree. No one has the right to rob another of their hopes and dreams — not even a god.
Trivia[]
Kazuha's friend's name has yet to be revealed; however, the community nicknamed him "Tomo."
Tomo (Japanese: 友) is the Japanese word for "friend."
In the Japanese version of the game, Kazuha mainly uses the word to refer to his friends.
Compared with the most common word for "friend" tomodachi (Japanese: 友達), today tomo is rarely used in daily conversations, as it sounds slightly archaic and has a poetic connotation. As such, the word tomo is often used by fictional characters from historical periods.
A Sapphire cat can be found near the Broken Blade Mound. This may be the same cat found tucked in Kazuha's friend's clothing in the cutscene he appears in.
This is supported by the fact that this particular cat cannot be captured with the Omni-Ubiquity Net, even though Sapphire cats are eligible to be captured with the Omni-Ubiquity Net.
Kazuha's friend was also a friend of Thoma's, and likely other members of the Kamisato household as well.[6]
In Japanese, the epitaph reads: 「春雷率いて、我を斬り、灰になろうとも、万の世の為。」 This translates roughly to: "Even if the spring thunder leads, slashes me, turns me into ashes, it's for the sake of the world of all."
