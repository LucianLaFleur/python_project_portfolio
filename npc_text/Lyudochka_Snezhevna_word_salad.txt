Profile[]
Lyudochka was an orphan raised in the House of the Hearth, an orphanage run by "The Knave" Arlecchino. Due to her Inazuman heritage, Lyudochka studied Inazuman matters from a young age.[1] She was friends with Katarina Snezhevna, who describes her as being "closer than a real sister."[2] Efim Snezhevich also had some shared history with her, which was why he showed her favor compared to the other agents from the House of the Hearth who were assigned to Inazuma.[3]
After the original "Gendou Ringo," Momoyo, faked her death after the Traveler and Paimon took on the strange fortune slips — which Momoyo had intended on using to lure out the Fatui — Lyudochka was assigned to replace Momoyo as "Gendou Ringo" and tasked with gaining the trust of two supposed Shuumatsuban members to infiltrate the organization: the Traveler and Paimon. Despite her efforts into the role, Yae Miko was already aware she was an imposter, although she did not confront her over it. Realizing that her task was impossible to complete and that she had begun to like life in Inazuma, Lyudochka unsuccessfully tried to stall and eventually received her "Final Instructions" from her Teacher, Efim Snezhevich. Efim had begun to get fed up with her stalling, further agitated after fellow spy Tae informed him she found a light novel in her purse.
The Traveler, seeing that Lyudochka genuinely regretted her actions and did not want the plan to succeed, came up with a plan with Momoyo to fake her death so Efim would not pursue her for her failure. Afterwards, she initially wanted to leave Inazuma out of guilt, but was convinced by the Traveler and Paimon to stay in Inazuma and adopt the Gendou Ringo identity for good.

Appearance[]
Lyudochka has red eyes and black hair cut into a chin-length bob with her bangs cut straight across. In combat, she is a Fatui Electro Cicin Mage.

As Gendou Ringo[]
Gendou Ringo wears the standard shrine maiden uniform consisting of a white kosode and red hakama, white tabi socks, and regular okobo sandals with red straps. She has blue eyes and black hair cut into a chin-length bob, and although not so visible in-game, the front portions of her hair are separated with dark brown accessories.

 How've things been going lately?

Gendou Ringo: I will stay here, and I will pray for you all in earnest. If you ever have something on your mind, I'll be happy to hear you out.
 Have you heard anything from Momoyo?

 See you around.
Gendou Ringo: See you! May your day be blessed.
