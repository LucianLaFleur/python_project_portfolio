Dialogue[]

Manager Xiao: Hmph. The younger generation are nothing but slackers these days.
 About Rex Lapis' death...
(After completing Rite of Descension)
Manager Xiao: Not now. I can't let myself be distracted while I'm at work.
Manager Xiao: I'm getting old myself, and the thought did once cross my mind: Will the dockyard collapse into dysfunction after I die?
Manager Xiao: But the answer is no! The orderly functioning of the dockyard, and of Liyue, is based on centuries of tradition. Things like that do not simply disappear overnight... I, for one, will not allow it!
Manager Xiao: In the same way, if the Lord of Geo is truly deceased... Well, I will simply continue to do my job. Just as I have always done. To do otherwise would be to dishonor his legacy.
(After completing The Fond Farewell)
Manager Xiao: Hmph. There's nothing to be said. Someone did once ask me if Liyue would descend into chaos should Rex Lapis pass away...
Manager Xiao: My answer then was "no" — and now that the Rite of Parting has ended, Liyue Harbor's present state proves that I was right!
Manager Xiao: Liyue Harbor has become a well-oiled machine over many years of development, one that will continue to run even in the absence of its creator!
Manager Xiao: That's all from me. There's still much to do! Manning our posts and doing our duty — that's how we will honor his memory!
 You are...?
Manager Xiao: I'm the Dockyard Manager here in Liyue Harbor. Name's Xiao. Is there something I can help you with? If not, I need to get back to work.
 Actually, about your work...
Manager Xiao: Work? Bah! Don't get me started! Young people these days... No expertise, zero sense of responsibility, they don't bother to tell you when they aren't going to show up, and when they do show up... Half the time they do more harm than good, and the other half they expect you to applaud every word that comes out of their mouths... Honestly, if we old folks weren't hand-holding them every step of the way...
Manager Xiao: I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Liyue's ships are the face of the nation. We should be aiming for perfection every time! Each spot you miss with the paintbrush harms not just my reputation, but that of Liyue itself!
Manager Xiao: Bah, I'm wasting my breath... You outlanders wouldn't understand anyway...
 See you.
Manager Xiao: Bah, hopefully not! Don't distract me anymore!

Event Dialogue[]
Fleeting Colors in Flight[]

Manager Xiao: Hmph. Young people nowadays have no work ethic worth mentioning!
Manager Xiao: They slack off at key times and care so much about the holidays, yet know nothing of enterprise or responsibility.
Manager Xiao: If everyone was this lax in their duties, we wouldn't have managed to construct a single small fishing boat, let alone the Jade Chamber!
