Dialogue[]

Maymunah: It's great that we're busy again, but management work is really a giant pain in the... huh? So you made time to visit the Fairgrounds today?
 Maymunah seems troubled...
Maymunah: Yes, it is spacious here, but the number of stalls is limited. After the light in the large tent got fixed, even more people are interested in applying for a stall...
Maymunah: Nothing is harder than making decisions and arrangements!
Maymunah: My predecessor must have abandoned me here and fled back to Sumeru because they just couldn't take it anymore...
Maymunah: Still, anything is hard when you're first starting. If I just take time to think and train my brain... I'm taking care of these Fairgrounds in her stead to prove...
Maymunah: To prove that things would have been better, if only she had spent more time.
 She?
Maymunah: Oh, I'm just rambling! Ignore my nonsense, haha.
Maymunah: Though now that I think about it... It's only thanks to your fixing the Crystal Light that I even have the opportunity for such worries...
 Oh? So I did more harm than help?
 You're really blaming me?
Maymunah: Hehe, just joking, just joking! Thanks for fixing the Crystal Light, I mean it.
Maymunah: Hehe... As part of your reward, shouldn't you see the fruits of your labor? Now that it's lively again, you should come visit more!
 I'm just looking around.
Maymunah: Hehe... Have a nice time.

Trivia[]
Under the effects of Elemental Sight, she is indicated to be affected by Hydro, similarly to Idyia and other NPCs in the Mirage.
