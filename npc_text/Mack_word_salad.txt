Mack wears one of the standard uniforms of the Knights of Favonius. The uniform consists of a black long-sleeve shirt, horse riding pants, gloves, and brown leather shoulder pads with brass-accented white plate armor worn on top. His vambraces however are black. Wing motifs decorate various parts of the armor along with the Knights of Favonius crest on the breastplate. A sheathed sword hangs from his belt on his left side and a blowing horn hangs from the back of his hip.

Dialogue[]

Mack: Hi. I'm Mack, a Knight of Favonius. Is there anything I can help you with?
 What are you doing here?
Mack: Ah, well do you see those two children over there?
Mack: They ran off to play together by themselves, without their parents.
Mack: I was concerned for their safety, so I thought I'd follow them.
 Who are those kids?
Mack: That's Will and Jill. Children aren't really supposed to leave the city without an accompanying adult...
Mack: But I thought, they just look so happy playing together. I couldn't bring myself to go and tell them off...
Mack: So I've just stayed here watching them. Otherwise, I'm not sure how I'd be able to face their parents.
 Goodbye.
Mack: Alright, have a good one.

Hidden Strife[]

(Talk to Mack where Falcon Coast's northern beach meets Windrise's grass)
Media:vo hyeq002 10 mack 01.ogg Mack: Hold it, I have to stop you right there. Sorry, the name's Mack.
Media:vo hyeq002 10 mack 02.ogg Mack: The Knights of Favonius are carrying out a training exercise near Falcon Coast. Access is temporarily denied to the public.
 But I don't see any knights on the beach...
Media:vo hyeq002 10 mack 03a.ogg Mack: They're still rounding up the troops, but they'll be arriving shortly.
Media:vo hyeq002 10 mack 03a 1.ogg Mack: Please return to the city. Combat training is boring to watch, and we don't want to risk you getting injured.
 But there are monsters on the beach...
Media:vo hyeq002 10 mack 03b.ogg Mack: Exactly. They will serve as targets for the knights participating in the training exercise.
Media:vo hyeq002 10 mack 03b 1.ogg Mack: Please return to the city. Combat training is boring to watch, and we don't want to risk you getting injured.
