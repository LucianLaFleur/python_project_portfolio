Dialogue[]

Paban: Moving dramas, tumultuous trials — The Steambird has it all, today and every day!
 And what's the news?
Paban: Interested? Well then, buy the paper!
Paban: Of course, if you're too lazy to read, you can also look for Sir Arthur. It will tell you about the latest news.
Paban: But if you're looking for news that isn't reported in the papers, you'll have some trouble finding it.
 What sort of news, for example?
Paban: For example... Well, to be honest, I don't know what you'd like to know.
Paban: Could I ask where you're from, and what your vocation might be?
Paban: That way, I might be able to pinpoint the information you're looking for.
 Something feels wrong...
Paban: Something wrong? I doubt it.
Paban: Only when you let me know what you know can I know what you want to know that you don't know.
(Obtain  Teachings of Equity ×3)
 And who's Sir Arthur?
Paban: Ah, and there's something you don't know.
Paban: However, I can give you this information for free — you can consider it a freebie for a new customer.
Paban: Sir Arthur is the eponymous "Steambird" in The Steambird.
Paban: This gentlebird isn't alive, but he can speak just fine.
 See you.
Paban: Come back any time!
