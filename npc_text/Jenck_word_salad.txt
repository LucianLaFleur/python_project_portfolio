Profile[]
Jenck is a "low-level" editor for The Steambird. He eventually learned of the truth behind Mosso Lombroso's legacy and how The Steambird had lied to the masses; enraged at the thought, he decided to get revenge. To this end, he collaborated with the Fatui. He made contact with Baulande's supervisor (who also reported to a Lord Harbinger); in return for finding Mosso's inheritance, they would help him take over paper and the spot of Editor-in-Chief from Euphrasie. After an unknown party stole Sir Arthur, the Melusine Talochard tried to investigate, though her attitude did not help. The Traveler then arrives and offers to assist in the matter alongside "Curve", who Talochard had brought out of storage.
During the investigation, the four were led to believe that a small group known as the Elegant Tableware Confreie stole Sir Arthur. After beating them up, the boss betrays "Intrepid Valberry" for seemingly going against orders; however, he states they sent him to the paper for revenge after they got the Marechaussee Phantom involved in their operations, resulting in 39 of their directors being apprehended. He then heads to the Fleuve Cendre to get a picklock, but discovers a member of the Fatui also there for the same reason. They soon manage to find the person, Baulande, who admits that when he had leaked info to Jenck regarding the criminals. This made him popular, but Baulard became enraged when Jenck refuses to compensate him; thus, he also went to get revenge, but discovers Sir Arthur missing when he arrives.
They eventually catch up to Baulande, who reveals that he was assigned by a Harbinger (implied to be Sandrone)[Note 1] to complete his mission. They eventually convince him to abandon it and discover Mosso's old facility, defeating the Fatui along the way. Jenck reveals himself at the end as the culprit and his motives, before he makes his escape while initiating the facility's self-destruct sequence. Jenck then seemingly disappears despite Talochard's attempts to find him. Eventually, Euphrasie contacts the three, where she reveals that Jenck was dumped inside the Opera Epiclese with his tongue cut out and mind broken, which she assumes was either the result of Baulande's supervisor not wanting to make an enemy out of them or their disapproval of Curve's destruction. He was promptly taken into custody by the Maison Gardiennage.

Notes[]

↑ Of the two Harbingers known for their interest in machines, the one behind Jenck severely punishes him for causing Curve's destruction and leaves an apology for Talochard, Paimon, and Traveler. This response does not align with The Doctor's characterization, which leaves Sandrone as the likely identity of the mystery Harbinger.
