 It's fine, don't worry...

Dialogue[]

Yingzhu: I'm sure we can figure this whole thing out...
 What's wrong?
Yingzhu: Huh, so you weren't paying attention last time, then?
Yingzhu: Basically, Sumeru Akademiya commissioned the Adventurers' Guild to investigate on their behalf, and we found an Irminsul Fruit.
Yingzhu: Judging by the scholars' response, it seemed to be an object of major significance for their research.
Yingzhu: Unfortunately, there was an incident while we were transporting the Irminsul Fruit, and it blew up. That's the long and short of it.
Yingzhu: Hosseini hasn't stopped moaning and groaning about it ever since. It's giving me a real headache...
 What does this mean for the Guild's relations with the Akademiya?
Yingzhu: Incidents like this are everyone's worst nightmare. It's damaging for the Guild's reputation, and it will affect our standing with the Akademiya...
Yingzhu: *sigh* It's such a mess. We have to find some way of putting everything right...
Yingzhu: Traveler, please do make the matter of the Irminsul Fruit fragments and the Energy Amplifier your top priority.
 Goodbye.
Yingzhu: We greatly appreciate your ongoing support in this matter, Traveler. Safe travels, and ad astra abyssosque!
