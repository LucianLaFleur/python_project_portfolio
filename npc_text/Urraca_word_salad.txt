Story[]
The parents of Urraca are merchants who are often out working and not interested in the lives of their children. Urraca is 16 years old and a 3rd year student with mediocre results. He spent a lot of money on tutoring and his gambling addiction. This has led him to search "even illegal" ways to obtain money, and so he listened to Sethos proposing a plan of extorting Cyrus for a lot of money. The boy is quickly caught by Cyno.[1]
