 More or less the same.

Dialogue[]

Semaine: Work is about the same no matter where you go — being here is best.
 And why is that?
Semaine: Because my workplace is closer to where I live.
Semaine: My previous work was related to the courts, so I had to shuttle between the Palais Mermonia and the opera house. This location, on the other hand, is far more convenient.
Semaine: Sometimes, I head over there to watch a performance — and what do you know, I do sometimes miss my previous workplaces when I see them.
 See you.
Semaine: Take care.
