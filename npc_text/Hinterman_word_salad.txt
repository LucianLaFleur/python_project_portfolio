Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Condition missing.


Hinterman: I have all sorts of fish here. What would you like?
 Let's have a look.
Hinterman: Please do.
(Opens Shop menu)
 Is there anything of note nearby?
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Hinterman knows)

Hinterman: A kind client told me that there's a place around here that produces Condessence Crystals and Magical Crystal Ore, asking if I'd need some to reinforce my fishing boat.
Hinterman: I don't need any right now, but it'd be a shame to not put them to good use. If you're interested, perhaps you can go have a look around here, eh?
(Rich Ore Reserve marked on the map)
(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Hinterman knows)

Hinterman: I'm sorry. I was busy with my fish stall, so if there was, I didn't notice.
 What is this place?
Hinterman: Welcome to Poisson, a little place for us fishermen.
Hinterman: The sights here aren't as grand as you'll see in the city, but everyone here lives a leisurely life.
Hinterman: Ah, yes. I should probably mention that the terrain here can be quite slippery, so if you're here to travel, do watch your step.
 I'm fine for now.
Hinterman: Take care, then.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Condition missing.


Hinterman: Oh my, aren't you the Boss's friend? Welcome!
 Could I buy some fish?
Hinterman: Oh, so you're really here to do that? Well, in that case, please go ahead.

 How are things in town?
Hinterman: Normal, ever-constant, just like our lady Navia's burning passion.
Hinterman: Thanks for your concern, though, and if you should meet the Boss later, do take care of her on our behalf too, alright?
 See you around.
Hinterman: Sure. Thanks for your help!

Dialogue Set #3[]
Available after step 5 in Deluge of Wrathful Waters.


Hinterman: Isn't this the Boss's friend? Things haven't been so good around Poisson recently. I know you're not from around here, but I wouldn't recommend tarrying.
 It's that bad, huh?
Hinterman: *sigh* The water rises quickly and recedes quickly. While it seems to be subsiding now, you never know when it'll be back.
 Take care.
Hinterman: Yes, I will.
Hinterman: But someone's gotta be on guard here at all times. We can't let some random person wander in here again by accident and get themselves killed.

Dialogue Set #4[]
Available after completing Masquerade of the Guilty.


Hinterman: Oh my, aren't you the Boss's friend? Welcome! Though things haven't been so good around Poisson recently, which may inconvenience you.
 What's going on?
Hinterman: Boss said that the crisis in the "prophecy" had passed, so loads of people came back to town. We're all pitching in, so reconstruction is coming along nicely.
Hinterman: It's still a little chaotic though, and people can hurt themselves if they're not careful. That's why I'm on guard here, to stop any outsiders from wandering in by accident.
 It's fine. I'm here to look around.
Hinterman: Well... just watch your step. You don't want to get hurt.

Dialogue Set #5[]
Available after Condition missing.

 How are things in town?
Hinterman: It's steadily improving. Most residents have gone back to their everyday lives.
Hinterman: Thanks for your concern, though if you meet the Boss later, do take care of her on our behalf too, alright? She's gone through a lot, she has.
 See you around.
Hinterman: Sure, and thanks!
