 Observation route...
Media:VO Hayyan 01.ogg "Looks like I may have to find a different investigation route."

Media:VO Hayyan All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Hayyan: (The Avidya Forest truly has great biodiversity. I won't have to worry about finding new research topics for the rest of my life!)

Dialogue[]

Hayyan: If I head left from here...
 You are...
Hayyan: I'm a researcher conducting observations of Avidya Forest's ecology, and that is my bodyguard. We're not suspicious people, so please don't be too wary of us.
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

Hayyan: The Withering seems to be spreading lately, but there hasn't been much of a change in Avidya Forest's ecology. I guess the Forest Rangers have been working really hard.
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

Hayyan: The Withering has been in full retreat of late, and though traces of it still remain, the forest is now in a much better state than before.
 About the rainforest...
Hayyan: If you know Sumeru, you'd know that this is just the easternmost area of it.
Hayyan: If you pass Caravan Ribat and go further west, you'll find yourself before an endless desert.
Hayyan: It's said that a very, very long time ago, Sumeru was a paradise covered in green, and the desert is the result of a disaster.
 About The Withering...
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Hayyan: The Withering... is the result of contamination.
Hayyan: If its source cannot be eradicated, then it will never end.
Hayyan: But the contamination of Irminsul is not so easily resolved, is it?
Hayyan: We can only trouble the Forest Rangers until a fundamental solution is found.
 Tell me more about The Withering, if you don't mind.
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Hayyan: As far as I've observed, no new taint has emerged within the rainforest. Even the preexisting Withering Zones are no longer expanding.
Hayyan: This is a good sign. That means that the forest is no longer being assailed by new impurities.
Hayyan: I believe that we researchers will make new strides in our research into Irminsul under Lesser Lord Kusanali's guidance.
 See you.
Hayyan: See you, it's best to plan out your route in advance before traveling through the forest.
