Xin Cheng is a pilgrim who is always in search for the adepti, which he believes shall offer him a blessing. He met Ganyu and the Traveler, believing them as adepti and asks for a blessing. Ganyu reluctantly told him that she is unable to do so as he needs to earn for it. Infuriated, Xin Cheng then proceeds to mock her by calling her a "useless" and leaves, thus giving a conflict over Ganyu by questioning herself.
