Profile[]
Alhaitham's grandmother served as his parental guardian after his parents died in an accident. She is Alhaitham's paternal grandmother[Note 1] and thus knew that Alhaitham inherited his love of reading from his father, but she is also strongly implied to have had a close relationship with both of Alhaitham's parents, as she observed the development of both of their personalities, talents, and intelligence in Alhaitham from an early age.
She is a pivotal figure in Alhaitham's backstory, having instilled in him many of the values he holds today when he was young. 
Alhaitham appears to still think about her long after her death, as the emerald-colored book that she left a note for him in is featured in his 2023 birthday art.
