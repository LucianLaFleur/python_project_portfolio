Profile[]
Yasumoto was the only traveling doctor remaining after the Tatarigami outbreak on Yashiori Island. Even after the death of the majority of the villagers, he continued to research a cure. The Pharmacist's Notebook he leaves after his disappearance suggests that he stayed behind because of guilt and a sense of responsibility, as he was unable to make any effective cure for the illness.
When the player follows elemental traces after his disappearance, the last clue leads to a basket of Naku Weeds that are left behind on the southernmost point of Yashiori Island.

Trivia[]
It is revealed in the Pharmacist's Notebook that Yasumoto was going to take care of Chouji, after recommending his mother go to Sumeru for a cure, before disappearing due to the player's involvement in helping him find a cure.
Despite his intentions, Chouji thought that Yasumoto was quite "creepy."
In the Incomplete Notes dropped by Washizu, Yasumoto is called a "fraud," because all he does is boil Lavender Melon and Sugar. In the Pharmacist's Notebook, Yasumoto reveals he did this, because he had no way of curing the Tataragami and thought that "caring is also a form of remedy."
Although Yasumoto's fate is left ambiguous, the Chinese description of the A Doctor's Odyssey is "Witness the ending of Yasumoto." (Chinese: 见证保本的结局。), indicating that Yasumoto's final fate is in the southernmost point of Yashiori Island.
