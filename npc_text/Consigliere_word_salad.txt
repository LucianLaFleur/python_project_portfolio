Consigliere responds to all prompts with ...


Consigliere: ...
 Err, hello?
 That's right, you can't talk...
 But are you really an ordinary, run-of-the-mill Tent Tortoise?
 Hah. What am I doing, expecting a reply like this...
 Ah, but then again, there can be no disappointment without expectations, right?
 Thank you. This is, indeed, a truth to be held self-evident.
 Why are you here?
 Do you not know, either?
 Just like how I don't know why I'm here either?
 ...Perhaps I should leave now, yes?
 You won't even so much as call out to me.
 Does your silence indicate displeasure?
 Is it too much to ask to expect you to make some noise?
 Alright then. In that case, I humbly beg your forgiveness.
 Impressive. You have won my respect...
(Available on all dialogue prompts)
 Heh. Never mind. Why am I talking to a Tent Tortoise, anyway...
