Profile[]
Trofin Snezhevich was an orphan taken in by the House of the Hearth, raised to become an agent of the Fatui. After growing up, he was deemed as "having potential" and was sent to Vimara Village, where he was tasked by the Harbinger "Il Dottore" to capture an Aranara, which could only be seen by children.[1]
For his mission, he adopted the name "Alphonso," claiming to be an apprentice from Fontaine. He lived in Vimara Village for several years and became close to the Forest Ranger Rana and the children Iotham, Sudabeh, and Kavus. However, he grappled with the guilt of having to forsake his Vimara Village "family" for the Fatui's goals, as he was unable to forsake his duty or his ties to his House of the Hearth "family." To lure the Aranara out, Trofin helped the Fatui kidnap the children by tricking them into going into the forest alone. However, the Aranara were capable of rescuing the children from under the Fatui's noses, while wiping the children's memories of their capture and rescue to prevent them from becoming accustomed to violence.[1]
Trofin is implied to have also kidnapped Varsha, an orphaned girl who had run away from Gandharva Ville. An Aranara rescued her as well, but deposited her in a cave sealed by a Claustroflora and did not wipe her memories of the incident like Arana had with the Vimara Village children.[2]
As part of the intelligence he received from the Fatui, Trofin learned about the Traveler, including their name. This detail — which is something Rana had not mentioned in front of him — is eventually what leads the Traveler to conclude that he is the "bad guy" hiding in the village, and they can choose to confront him over his involvement in the children's disappearances. During the confrontation, the player may choose to spare or kill him.[1]
If spared, he agrees to leave; never to return to either Vimara Village or the Fatui, since he had shamed his former "family" on his failure and discovery. His Tattered Paper can be found abandoned in Old Vanarana, with two Riftwolves surrounding it, suggesting he may have died there. If the player chooses to kill him, he puts up a fight despite knowing that he would most certainly lose, and his last words are dedicated to Iotham. His Tattered Paper is automatically obtained on his death.

Trivia[]
Fellow Fatui Pyro Agent Oleg mentions him during The Foolish Fatuus, pointing out how Trofin had failed to make any progress after staying in Sumeru for years.
Although he claims to be a Fontainian, he wears a Mondstadter outfit, which may hint at his deceit.
