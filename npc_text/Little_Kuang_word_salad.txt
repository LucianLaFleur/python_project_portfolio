 I never knew!
Media:VO Little Kuang 01.ogg "Wow! I never knew how awesome it is in Chenyu Vale!"

Dialogue[]

Little Kuang: Huh, that's so fascinating! Chenyu Vale is so unlike Liyue Harbor!
 Run into anything fun?
Little Kuang: In a lot of ways!
Little Kuang: For example, there are absolutely huge goats in the village to the south, ten times larger than the goats in any book!
Little Kuang: While floating over on a bamboo raft, I saw a jade ornament the size of a mountain... A jade ring? A jade pendant? What was it again...
Little Kuang: Whatever! Forget it! I'll figure it out one day.
Little Kuang: A girl fishing by the waterfall said there's a type of Carp in Chenyu Vale that bestows good luck upon those who see it! I wanna find one!
Little Kuang: The most interesting is the Wushou Dance that Dip Yeuk and his friends are doing! They're like big cats with painted faces nimbly jumping up and down!
Little Kuang: Anyway... Everything here is so novel! So many things here I've never seen or heard of before!
 Play safe, y'hear?
Little Kuang: It's fine! Chenyu Vale is huge, so there are so many places where I can play!
Little Kuang: My parents wouldn't let me leave the city when we lived in Liyue Harbor, so I was limited to playing by the entrance or at the docks...
Little Kuang: But there were too many people in both those places. I kept running into people all the time. Sometimes, there would be groups of people moving things at the docks, and that put me at risk of being struck by something.
Little Kuang: Yeelong Barf is much better. It may be small, but it has just the right amount of people, so I can play to my heart's content!
 Bye, go have some fun!
Little Kuang: Hehe, I'm going to meet Dip Yeuk later so he can tell me his amazing stories about Gaming!
