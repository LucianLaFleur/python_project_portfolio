Story[]
In Zhongli's Story Quest, Kliment would often impolitely deride and abuse Wanyan over her archaeology qualifications. Kliment was also extremely greedy for treasure rather than pursuing actual archaeological or historical knowledge.
When Kliment was deriding and mistreating Wanyan, Zhongli proposed that Kliment and Wanyan engage in a contract over how to split and share the treasures found in the ruins. When the materialistic Kliment breaks the contract out of excessive greed and wants to steal Wanyan's treasure, as punishment for breaking the contract, Zhongli and the Traveler enter a boss fight to beat Kliment up. After Kliment is defeated, he leaves the ruins.[2]
