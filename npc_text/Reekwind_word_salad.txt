Profile[]
Reekwind is a Millelith that can be found pacing in Liyue's dockyard to look for his lost polearm. He used to be a slacker and gained the nickname "Reekwind" from his squad mates. When he finally quit being lazy, he became forgetful and lost his polearm and wallet. A copy of his message looking for his polearm can be found in Chihu Rock Bulletin Board.

Dialogue[]

Reekwind: Oh hi, traveler.
Reekwind: I'm responsible for security in this district. Right now, I'm out on patrol... and I'm also looking for something.
 What are you looking for?
Reekwind: I don't suppose you've seen a Millelith-issue polearm around here, have you?
Reekwind: This is so strange... It must be around here somewhere...
Reekwind: *sigh* If any of my squad mates find out, they're gonna give me another annoying nickname, I just know it...
 How does a soldier manage to lose his weapon?
Reekwind: Shh... Don't let the sergeant hear. Look, it's not like I did it on purpose, okay?
Reekwind: Believe it or not, I used to be a bit of a lazy slacker. Didn't care much for my appearance. Then, my squad mates starting calling me Reekwind...
Reekwind: I managed to whip myself into shape, break the habit of a lifetime and quit being so lazy... But then, the forgetfulness took its place.
Reekwind: Earlier today, I took a short break at that food stall over there. Kinda zoned out for a bit, and when I snapped back, I looked down and somehow there was a laundry pole in my hand... Not a clue where my Millelith polearm went...
Reekwind: If my squad mates find out I managed to lose my polearm... Who knows what kind of awful new nickname they'll come up with?
 Sorry, I'm a bit busy.
Reekwind: Alright, well... If you see a polearm around, let me know, will you? I'll pay you for your trouble.
Reekwind: Wait... Where's my coin pouch!?
