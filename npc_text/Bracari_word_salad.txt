 Granny's here...
Media:VO Bracari 01.ogg "If there's anything you need, you can always come to Granny."

Dialogue[]

Bracari: Perhaps I should grill a few more cookies for the children? Or perhaps that Bulle Fruit cake from the last time — that was pretty good.
 It certainly sounds tasty.
Bracari: Hehe, as long as the children like it, all is well.
Bracari: The adults here are very busy with work, so children often come and buy things for their families, and I bring them snacks when they do.
Bracari: Sometimes that girl Navia drops by too, bringing gifts of all sizes. She asks for cake pretty often, too — just like a kid, she is...
 Tell me about Navia...
Bracari: I'm an old acquaintance of her father. Got a hand in her marksmanship, too, if I do say so myself.
Bracari: Of course, she didn't learn it here. This place is too small — any drawing of weapons isn't going to end well for anyone.
Bracari: If someone does dare cause trouble here, they will be sent away to start a new life in the ocean.
 See you.
Bracari: Take care, and mind you don't fall down!

Wanna try? I can walk you through it step by step. You'd be my first student, but I feel like I'd be a great teacher. I still remember everything that my father and Nanny Bracari ever taught me!
