Dialogue[]

Yamashiro Kenta: Hello there, dear customer! Welcome!
Yamashiro Kenta: We currently have an ongoing event at our store with prizes to be won. Interested?
 Well, let's see what you've got...
Yamashiro Kenta: Of course. We have a special selection brought in from Watatsumi Island for your perusal!
(Opens Shop menu)
 What do you sell here?
Yamashiro Kenta: See, I'm from Watatsumi Island, and I opened this stall here in Ritou with my trademark being these round and radiant Watatsumi Pearls. Perfect for gifts or for wearing in your hair.
Yamashiro Kenta: Some of my fishermen friends from Watatsumi Island also send unagi here to be sold. I'm from a fishing family myself, so it goes without saying that I'll lend some neighbors a hand, you know what I mean?
Yamashiro Kenta: Our unagi is well-priced, and it's a mighty rare sight here in Ritou, so it's sold pretty well, haha! Small profits and quick turnover, that's how you stay in business for a long time.
Yamashiro Kenta: Oh, right. I've also brought some old relics that some of my ancestors fished out of the sea some time back. If you're a customer of finer tastes, you can have a look at those.
 Prizes to be won, you say?
Yamashiro Kenta: That's right, we're giving out prizes for store names!
Yamashiro Kenta: I wanted to come up with a catchy name and also get some publicity at the same time, so this is my two-in-one solution.
Yamashiro Kenta: The clients here were very enthusiastic, and they gave me a lot of suggestions.
Yamashiro Kenta: It's just that, well... Most of the names have been something too, uh, special. Like "The Watatsumi Pearl," the "Nagi-Nagi," "Tumbly-Round-Super-Shiny," and so on.
Yamashiro Kenta: Standing out from the crowd is good, of course, but I reckon that it would be better if we went with something that has broad appeal, so I've yet to decide on a final name.
Yamashiro Kenta: If you have any good ideas, please take part in the event as well!
 See you.
Yamashiro Kenta: See you. Come again soon!
