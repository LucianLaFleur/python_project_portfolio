Dialogue[]

Qiu'ge: *cough* ...Ugh...
Qiu'ge: Are you here for the opera? I'm sorry, but my throat's not feeling so swell...
 What happened to it?
Qiu'ge: *cough* I'm a recent debutante, but I hurt my throat while singing a short time ago.
Qiu'ge: Mm... Well, it's not much. My teacher used to say that this often happens to us opera singers.
Qiu'ge: Fortunately, the troupe seems to have stopped performing for certain reasons, which has given me some time to rest my voice... *cough*
Qiu'ge: *sigh* How many more times must I hurt my throat before I can become a star like Yun Jin?
 About the opera...
Qiu'ge: *cough* Well, although life's not great before you make a name for yourself, and my teacher would hit me often...
Qiu'ge: To me, standing on stage and becoming the center of attention makes it all worth it.
Qiu'ge: Imagine the enraptured audience, beside themselves with grief or clutching their bellies with laughter because of my every action and change of expression...
Qiu'ge: Ah... If you'd ever had that feeling, you would know what I'm talking about.
 See you.
Qiu'ge: Farewell, dear guest, and be sure to come and watch my show once my throat has healed up.
