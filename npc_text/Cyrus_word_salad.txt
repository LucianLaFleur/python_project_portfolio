"Cyrus"'s locationAdditional context
Profile[]
"Cyrus" served as a beast of burden for Tirzad's archaeological team, having been rented out to them by Bonifaz before the events of Lost in the Sands. Bonifaz is particularly worried about its safety. Like its fellow Sumpter Beasts, "Dandelion" and "Windwheel Aster," it is named after a fixture of Mondstadt, though it is the only one named after an actual person. When the Traveler asks Bonifaz whether the real Cyrus knows about this, Bonifaz assures them that it will be fine as long as no one tells him.
After the conclusion of Golden Slumber, it returns to Bonifaz's care and remains with him in Aaru Village.
