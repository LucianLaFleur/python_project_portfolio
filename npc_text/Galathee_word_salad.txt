Dialogue[]

Galathee: Will I ever be able to sail to the world's end?
 About your next route...
Galathee: My first mate and I haven't really made plans just yet, but I do hope that we'll make it a little further.
Galathee: Each time I return to land and look back upon the route that we just took in this manner, I can't help but sigh...
Galathee: Even the longest of sea routes is still all too short when seen from on high.
Galathee: Perhaps one cannot traverse every river and every ocean in a single lifetime.
Galathee: But since I've chosen this path... You never know what you'll encounter unless you try, right? Haha.
 Like the constant adventures.
Galathee: Yes, my friend, precisely.
Galathee: Navigating to the end of the world is my goal, and the process of achieving it is just as important.
Galathee: Though I am not an adventurer, my adventuring experiences are just as thrilling as theirs.
(Obtain  Adventurer's Experience ×4)
(Available after Step 9 of Soloist's Prologue but before completing Masquerade of the Guilty)
 Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
Galathee: Although there have been instances of rising water levels in our history, I'm inclined to focus on my current life and what I'll do before the prophecy comes to pass.
Galathee: I mean, everyone must return to their home and set their feet on solid ground one day, after having departed on countless voyages.
Galathee: As for distant dangers like prophecies, I think it's best left to long-lived beings such as deities.
(Available after completing The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur)
 About the prophecy...
Galathee: About that... I heard that when the prophecy occurred, the chaos was worst around the opera house. Romaritime Harbor was too far away, and all sorts of rumors were flying around.
Galathee: Some people said that the Hydro Archon did all she could to prevent the ultimate disaster, while others said it was Monsieur Neuvillette who resolved it...
Galathee: Well, seeing as Lady Furina has, indeed, left her post, I'm leaning more towards... the former statement?
 See you.
Galathee: See you, friend. Sail safe!
