Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before finishing Favonian Goodies and Buddies


Mats: All your general goods sold here at affordable prices, come and take a look!
 And you are...
Mats: Well, if it isn't the Honorary Knight! It's a pleasure to meet you!
Mats: I was doing business abroad previously, and I normally only come back during Weinlesefest. It's no surprise that we haven't met before.
Mats: If it's meant to be, I'm sure we'll meet again elsewhere!
 How's business these days?
Mats: Not bad at all!
Mats: As you can see, Weinlesefest is swarming with guests! I can make as much in one day here as I normally would in four or five!
Mats: I wish there were more lively festivals like this one!
 See you.
Mats: See you, may we meet again!

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available before finishing Charity Event! A Great Success!


Mats: Yo, Honorary Knight! Would you like to hear good news from the shop?
 What about the shop?
Mats: Haha, let me break it down for you, and you can tell me what you think!
(Open shop management page)
 Thank you for your hard work!
Mats: Saying that will out you as an outsider! It's not hard work, it's a good time!

Dialogue Set #3[]
Available after finishing Charity Event! A Great Success!


Mats: Yo, I heard the charity sale was a great success. Congratulations, Honorary Knight!
 This is the result of our collaborative efforts.
Mats: Hehe, good point!
Mats: This event has invigorated me. We didn't make money, but we had more fun than ever.
Mats: I guess it's the satisfaction of doing a good deed.
 Let's work together next time!
Mats: Sure! I'm about to leave, too!
Mats: Next time I'll be sure to try harder!
