Parsifal the Great, also written as the Great Magician "Parsifal" and simply Parsifal, was the alias of a Fontainian woman who came from Fleuve Cendre. She lived before the cataclysm 500 years ago and was acquainted with several important Fontainian figures, including Eduardo Baker and Karl Ingold. She also had a sister, known by her alias "Josephine," whom she performed magic tricks with as a disguise for their thievery.[1]

Profile[]
Parsifal and Josephine's birth names are unknown and they adopted their stage names from one of Coppelius' plays, which was loosely based on the tale of Mondstadt's Parsifal and Blue-Eyed Spear Witch. They first began performing magic tricks at Eduardo's tavern and eventually became skilled enough that the two began performing in the aboveground Court of Fontaine, where they quickly became the talk of the town.[1]
At some point in time following the Siege of Poisson, Parsifal committed an "unexpected transgression" which led her to request trial by combat. She had her last duel against the Champion Duelist Marfisa, whom she had history with.[2]

Story[]
Parsifal and her sister Josephine were born in Fleuve Cendre, the impoverished underground sector of the Court of Fontaine. The two became thieves to survive, stealing from guests at the opera house, but became dazzled by the idea of standing onstage themselves. The two became the renowned magician and assistant duo, although Parsifal was better known than her sister.[1]
During the purge of Fleuve Cendre, Josephine rushed back, only to find the destruction left in its wake.[1] Josephine's whereabouts after that is left unaddressed, but Parsifal went on to join Eduardo during his takeover of Poisson. She was captured in Karl's photograph of the major figures at Poisson: Parsifal, Eduardo, Baker's son Jakob, Renault de Petrichor (then the mayor of Poisson), Renault's son Rene, Rosa Reed (holding her unnamed infant son), Rosa's husband Thompson, and Tom Alter.[3]
During the Siege of Poisson, Parsifal saved Karl's life; however, she was eventually brought before the court for her participation in the siege, where she requested trial by combat. She took up arms one last time against the Champion Duelist Marfisa and presumably died in the duel. Years later, while reminiscing on the past during a meeting with Basil Elton, Karl regretted that he never recorded Parsifal's final duel, having quit news journalism following the Siege of Poisson.[2]
