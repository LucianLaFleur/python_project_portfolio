 What the plan?
Media:VO Cava 01.ogg "Ughhh, c'mon! What should I do today?"

Dialogue[]

Cava: What shall we do later? Should we try racing to see who can get from the town to the big boat faster?
 Is there anything of note nearby?
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Cava knows)

Cava: Oh wait! I did see loads of strange, glittering rocks when I went out to play earlier! They were really pretty! Some were dark blue, and others, light blue.
Cava: But... When I came back to grab some tools, Granny Yvette stopped me. Said I was too young to be playing with pickaxes...
Cava: I think it was somewhere hereabouts. Wanna take a look?
(Rich Ore Reserve marked on the map)
(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Cava knows)

Cava: Uh, what do you mean? I haven't seen anything odd...
 I haven't got time for that at the moment...
Cava: Oh, I get it, you're one of those "people with things to do," like my dad and mom.
Cava: Grandpa says that you shouldn't trouble people like that, so I won't bother you anymore. I'll play by myself.
Cava: I'm very good at that — even playing by myself can be a super fun thing!
Cava: Well, I guess it's Super Fun Thing Number 2. Number 1 is when Navia comes around!
(Becomes available after Condition missing‍[verification needed])
 Do you need me to tell her?
Cava: You know Navia? Awesome!
Cava: Hmm... Let me think... No, it's okay. Navia is one of those who "have things to do." If I disturb Navia, Grandpa would lecture me again.
Cava: But since you're Navia's friend, you're my friend, too! Have this! I won't take no for an answer!
(Obtain  Pate de Fruit ×3)
 Tell me about Big Sis Navia...
Cava: She's the one the adults call the Boss.
Cava: But that sounds super serious. Makes her sound like some old guy smacking tables and yelling at people — that doesn't seem like Navia at all!
Cava: Whenever she's around, the town's a super lively place. Even the grown-ups laugh and are happy.
Cava: Sometimes she even brings some amazing clockwork toys back for Granny Yvette to look at.
Cava: The look on Granny's face when she sees them — y'know, the kind people have when they want to say something but hold back? It's pretty funny.
(Available after completing Masquerade of the Guilty)
 About the flood...
Cava: Frankly, I was terrified when the water level started rising! But I didn't even have time to react before Archenoul rushed over and took me away.
Cava: Once everything settled down, I thanked her three times, just like grandpa taught me!
Cava: I guess only the strong can become a hero like Archenoul, huh?
Cava: I have to work hard! I'll run! I'll jump! And I'll swim!
 Do your best.
Cava: Huh? You don't wanna race me? Alright then.
