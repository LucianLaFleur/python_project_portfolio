Iwata's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Iwata is a villager of Borou Village who tries to grow produce for Watatsumi Island's residents. However, the island's somewhat poor soil caused most of them to wither and die; while some were still edible, it would not be enough to sustain the village. Despite the obvious failings, Iwata refused to give up in his quest to successfully grow crops and began experimenting with making his own fertilizer. During his latest batch, he unintentionally attracted slimes, forcing the Traveler to intervene. Gorou then arrived and told him that his attempts at making fertilizer was causing the villagers to complain, just as two soldiers informed him they had detained a suspicious person.
The Traveler recognized the person as Alrani and with the help of Kaushik, was able to convince them that she was a Sumeru Akademiya student. In return for studying the island, Gorou had Alrani help Iwata with his farming problem as she was still working for Sayid's fertilizer business.

 Different seeds...
Media:VO Iwata 01.ogg "Well, let's try some different seeds."

Dialogue[]

Iwata: Another failure... What sort of seeds should I try next time, hmm?
Hirai: You've tried this many times already, but nothing grows here for long. Aren't you ready to give up yet?
Hirai: The soil here on Watatsumi Island has never been suited to farming. We've only gotten some carrots to grow at the most, and I doubt even Sumeru fertilizers could help us here. Seriously, just give up already.
Hirai: Even if you can't go out to sea with me on account of your old injuries, you can still do some other work.
Iwata: No! How can we allow ourselves to be beaten down by adversity so easily? Never, I say! I will find something that can grow on this land.
Iwata: I should really be asking *you* why you keep wandering around the village. Weren't you gonna go out and catch some fish?
Hirai: Fish? Of course I'm going to do that!
Hirai: It's just that I caught sight of some strange ships when I went out recently. They seemed to be from another land...
Hirai: The sight of them left me rather ill at ease, and I thought that I'd exercise more caution out at sea in the future...
