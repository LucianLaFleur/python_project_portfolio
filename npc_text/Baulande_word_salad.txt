Story[]
Baulande was assigned a mission by a certain Lord Harbinger (implied to be Sandrone)[Note 1] to assist Jenck, a low-level editor from The Steambird who had dug up information about Mosso Lombroso's legacy. Baulande assists Jenck by giving him information on the Elegant Tableware Confrerie's activities, increasing the editor's reputation at the paper. However, Jenck refuses to compensate Baulande for his efforts, so Baulande attempts to break in, but on the night he did so, he notices Sir Arthur missing and a letter on his perch.[1]
Baulande took the mission as if he was successful, he would enjoy an early retirement with his family, who lived on the outskirts of the Court of Fontaine. However, he was discovered by the Traveler, Paimon, Talochard, and "Curve", though Talochard initially let him go. He was eventually caught by the group again and was convinced to hand over Sir Arthur's Head. To avoid punishment from directly disobeying a Harbinger's orders and not completing his mission, he and his family went into hiding.[2]

Notes[]

↑ Of the two Harbingers known for their interest in machines, the one behind Jenck severely punishes him for causing Curve's destruction and leaves an apology for Talochard, Paimon, and Traveler. This response does not align with The Doctor's characterization, which leaves Sandrone as the likely identity of the mystery Harbinger.
