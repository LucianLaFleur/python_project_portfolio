Teyya was the head of the hunting party. According to Jeht, she was "a more capable competitor" than Babel, which made her a threat to Babel's rule of the tribe. Babel ordered Jeht to assassinate her, and Jeht "made her disappear in the desert."[1] Teyya's name appears struck out on the Crumpled Namelist in Jeht's tent in the Tanit Camps.
