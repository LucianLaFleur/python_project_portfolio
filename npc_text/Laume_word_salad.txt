Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

Laume: Hello! Ah, you look like you're from outside the village. Excuse me, but would you accept my request for an interview?
 What? We've got reporters here too?
Laume: Hehe. A journalist, huh... Looks like I give people the same impression as a real one, huh?
Laume: That said, I'm not a real journalist. I'm studying hard to become one, though...
Laume: Just like the ones who write for The Steambird!
 Oh, so there's a Melusine newspaper nowadays?
Laume: I—I'm working on one of my own. I record the things that happen every day into it — and I make some drawings for it, too.
Laume: Huh. Wait a moment, I'm the one conducting the interview, so why are you the one asking the questions? Well, whatever — as long as the content's newsworthy...
Laume: Hmm... "Outland Visitor Reports Business to Merusea Chief Reporter! Guest Interested in the Future of Melusine News Industry!"
Laume: Hehe, that's our title!
(After Step 3 of There Will Come Soft Rains and before completing Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog)
 About the earthquake just a while ago...
Laume: Eh? You mean you felt that rumbling in the earth, too?
Laume: This is a first for our village! Hmm, my journalistic intuition tells me that some big scoop is about to come along.
 Let's do this next time, shall we...
Laume: Sure. Please be sure to accept my offer next time, though, alright?

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Ancient Colors.


Laume: I didn't think that something this huge would happen in the village. Everything was quaking! Thank goodness no one was injured...
Laume: Well, a miraculous earthquake in which no one was injured sounds pretty cool, too!
Laume: Ah, I heard of your heroics during the earthquake. What would you say to an interview?
(Dialogue continues same as above)
