Profile[]
Yuan Hong is the father of three deceased sons: Yuan Cheng, Yuan Qing, and Yuan Liang. He planted a tree and left behind a will for his sons in the hopes that they would understand it, but each one mistakenly believes that there was real treasure hidden in the mines and left soon after, leaving him disappointed. When the Traveler and Paimon arrives at the village, they ran into his ghost, who remarked about the treasure. The Traveler manages to locate the wills and the tree that Hong had written in his will. A group of Treasure Hoarders had also taken interest in the will, also believing that it led to treasure.
Once the Treasure Hoarders were driven off, the Traveler discovered Hong's "treasure" and the family "reunited". The sons lament over their fall over the treasure, while Hong is disappointed that they believed the "treasure" was in the mines. He reveals that every year when he was alive, he would come to the tree and place some items in the chest, hoping that when they discovered it, would celebrate, revealing that the main "treasure" was their family bond, after which the four disappeared.
