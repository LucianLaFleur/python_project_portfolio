Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Marla: Hello... Can I help you with something?
 You look sleepy.
Marla: *yawn* Yeah... I feel like I'm about to fall asleep any second. So if you've got something to say, tell me quick...
 Nothing in particular...
Marla: Okay then... Good thing this bench is here, I think I'll have a nap now.
 Why are you so exhausted?
Marla: Hmm... Well, it's because I can only meet with my lover at night.
Marla: The other reason is that I've been reading the Boar Princess series lately. I just finished the grand finale.
Marla: The ending is a bit strange, but it's so wonderful that the Boar Princess and the wolf pup could be together!
Marla: Have you read it? If you haven't, please do... and please help me return it to the library when you've finished it, thanks.
(Obtain  The Boar Princess (VII))
 I'll leave you alone...
Marla: *snoring*

Nighttime[]

Marvin: You came to me again, my darling Marla!
Marla: Oh, Marvin; how could I ever let you go! I don't care what your father thinks about our being together, my love for you is like... like the ice at the river's source in Springvale...
Marvin: Marla, no... Your love should not be a thing so cold...
Marla: I mean not that; I mean that my love will become a sweet spring of live-giving water with which to quench your thirst for a thousand — nay, for ten thousand years...
Marvin: Oh, Marla, my love! Then my love for you is like the eyes of the eagle who soars over Falcon Coast...
Marla: Marvin, no... Your love should not be a thing so shrewd...
Marvin: I mean not that; I mean that I could not bear for you to disappear from my gaze, even for a moment; and if ever there came one who sought to steal you away from me, I would surely make known unto them the sharpness of my talons and the hardness of my beak...
Marla: Oh, Marvin!
Marvin: Oh, Marla!

Event Dialogue[]
Invitation of Windblume[]
Daytime[]

Marla: It's Windblume Festival again... I suppose the Windblumes must be dandelions, after all.
Marla: No matter how strong the wind, it can only blow dandelions away, but it will never cause them to perish.
Marla: But this is just my opinion. But it may be for this reason that dandelions became the symbols of love.
Marla: I hope... I hope that our love will be just as resilient.
(Dialogue options and responses are the same as normal)

Nighttime[]

Marvin: Marla, the Windblume Festival is here, and yet, it holds no meaning for me...
Marla: Oh, Marvin, say not that!
Marla: We do not have your father's approval, but this time for lovers is ours also...
Marvin: No, what I mean is that as long as I am with you, every day may as well be the Windblume Festival.
Marla: You're right, Marvin. Our love is like the dandelions that bloom on Cape Oath...
Marvin: Marla, no... Our love should not be a thing so fragile...
Marla: No, I mean to say that though the dandelions are scattered by the wild winds, their lives will not thusly end.
Marla: Dandelion Seeds will fly to distant places, take root, and sprout there... One day, they will cover the length and breadth of Teyvat.
Marvin: Oh, my darling Marla...
Marla: Oh, Marvin! My love...

Of Ballads and Brews[]

(Nighttime; After Aroma of the Past)‍[verification needed]
Marla: There you are, dear Marvin.
Marvin: Oh, Marla! I can't turn my back on you, not when you're inviting me to Weinlesefest!
Marla: No matter what your father thinks of us, my love... is like wine made from Mist Flowers...
Marvin: Marla, no... Your love should not be a thing so cold...
Marla: No. I mean that, my love will turn into burning liquor to warm you for a thousand —& nay, for ten thousand years...
Marvin: Oh, Marla, my love! Then my love for you is like the bitter north wind that follows the west wind...
Marla: Marvin, no... Your love should not be a thing so chilly...
Marvin: No. I mean that, I don't want you out of my sight, not even for a moment. I want to turn into a full season of Mondstadt's wind, always by your side...
Marla: Oh, Marvin!
Marvin: Oh, Marla!
