Dialogue[]

Betresa: Our previous leader, Lord Bamoun...
 Hey there. You mentioned Bamoun, didn't you?
Betresa: Ah, greetings, Traveler.
Betresa: Ah, I know of you. Indeed, we all know about the journey you, Lord Cyno, and Sir Tighnari made to our Temple. We thank you all for making that decision.
 We didn't do anything... No need to thank us.
Betresa: You may not know this, but Lord Bamoun and I were very close friends.
Betresa: I'm usually in charge of day-to-day matters, and after he fell ill, caring for Lord Bamoun often fell to me.
Betresa: As you see, I am hardly young myself and have lived here all my life...
Betresa: Here, we keep secrets and shoulder our duties. To put things nicely, we have our principles. To be blunter about it... We have nowhere else to go.
Betresa: Lord Bamoun and I have spent our whole lives in the desert. He was full of life and boldness in his youth, just like you, and thus became our leader.
Betresa: I sometimes feel that he was always searching for a way to better the lives of all humans.
Betresa: It was for this purpose that he obtained the Ba Fragments to protect our faith — the contest with you, your companions, and Sir Cyrus was part of it too.
 You believe that he intended all this?
Betresa: Though I am not sure what you are referring to specifically, I would think so.
Betresa: Lord Bamoun had hoped for change to come all his life, which is why he treasured his relationship with Sir Cyrus.
Betresa: He believed that the challenges he took upon himself could bring the changes to the current situation that we needed.
Betresa: And as you have seen, Lord Sethos has succeeded him as our new leader.
Betresa: As surely as we have eyes to witness it, the Akademiya and the Temple of Silence shall begin building bridges between them once more... It comes a little late, but I believe it is what Lord Bamoun desired.
Betresa: He and his grandson, Lord Sethos, were very close, and they must have agreed on this long ago.
 Thanks for explaining.
Betresa: Think nothing of it, Traveler. As I see it, you, too, represent many possibilities, and I am glad to have met you here.
Betresa: Lord Sethos, too, says that you are a friend to us and the Temple. Stay a while if you have time. I imagine all of us would be glad of it.
