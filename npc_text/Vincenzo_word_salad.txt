Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available after step 8 of Deluge of Wrathful Waters.


Vincenzo: Please, friend, stay. It's not the time to go to Poisson, so please come back.
 You are...
Vincenzo: I'm with Spina di Rosula. As you can see, the town's suffered flooding recently, and it's a total mess.
Vincenzo: While the waters have receded for now, no one knows what's going to happen. Perhaps you also know of the "prophecy"...
Vincenzo: Anyway, the townspeople have already evacuated. No help is needed right now, so you should really get out of here too.
 I see...
Vincenzo: Yep. The water's been unstable these days, so it's best if you just leave. Quickly.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Masquerade of the Guilty.


Vincenzo: Hello, do you need any help?
 You are...
Vincenzo: I'm with Spina di Rosula. I mainly used to work in the Court of Fontaine, but the Boss sent me here a while ago.
Vincenzo: I'm sure you know that the town was flooded. I've come to help the people here rebuild their homes.
Vincenzo: Ah, though they've lost so much, most of them are staying strong. They even care about me being tired...
Vincenzo: To be honest, after getting to know everyone, I don't really want to leave...
 No need, thank you.
Vincenzo: Hmm. The road's still not in great shape, so please be careful.

Dialogue Set #3[]
Available after Condition missing.


Vincenzo: I would have never discovered my gift for fishing if I hadn't moved to Poisson.
 You're...
Vincenzo: Hello, I'm with the Spina di Rosula. I used to work in the Court of Fontaine until the Boss sent me here.
Vincenzo: I'm sure you know that the town was flooded. I came over then to help the people here rebuild their homes.
Vincenzo: Take a look for yourself! The rebuilt Poisson is quite beautiful, huh? And that's why I moved here with the intention of settling down.
Vincenzo: Everyone here is so friendly, and they even taught me how to fish and dive... well, this is the birthplace of the Spina after all.
 See you.
Vincenzo: See you. It's pretty nice here in town, so you should stay for a while.
