Takatsukasa Chika is Takatsukasa Isamu's young daughter. She loves her deceased father dearly, and is close to Ryuuji, Isamu's former assistant, who she calls Uncle (although he insists she calls him her brother as he considers himself to be like a son to Isamu). In Shikanoin Heizou's Hangout Event: Act I - Trap 'Em by Storm, Heizou and the Traveler find her with Ryuuji a day after they have told him the truth about Isamu's murder. Chika demonstrates an innocent attitude and no knowledge of her father's darker side.[1]
