Avidya Forest[]

(Talk to Arapratap)
Arapratap: It's Nara! Arapratap wants to play a game with you. Will you play with Arapratap, good Nara?
 Sure. What are we playing?
Arapratap: Arapratap will show nice stuff to Nara, but only for a second, then Arapratap will hide the nice stuff.
Arapratap: If Nara remembers, Nara will know how much nice stuff Arapratap thinks.
Arapratap: Are you ready, Nara?
 Let's do this.
 Next time for sure.
Arapratap: Arapratap can wait.
(If the player breaks any of the crates)
Arapratap: Whoa, it was broken... But that doesn't change the number Arapratap has in mind. Think carefully, Nara.
(Talk to Arapratap after the countdown)

 One.
Arapratap: Stupid Nara got it wrong.

Arapratap: Oh yeah! It's the Golden Nara! Come and play games with Arapratap!
 Sure, what are we playing?
Arapratap: Arapratap prepared a lot of "good stuff," and will spread them all out. Nara should look and count carefully.

Arapratap: Are you ready, good Nara?
 Let's do this.
 Next time for sure.
Arapratap: Arapratap will wait patiently...

Arapratap: Are you ready, Nara?
 Let's do this.
 Next time for sure.
