Dialogue[]

Roshana: Want a drink? Let the bartender know.
 And you are...
Roshana: As you see, just a staff member.
Roshana: Though I don't make cocktails or wait on customers.
Roshana: After all, we have a bartender and Nesmil here. Nesmil could handle most of the work alone.
Roshana: The bartender actually owns the place.
Roshana: He doesn't want to offend customers, so he'll try to meet any of your demands.
 You dislike working here?
Roshana: I don't actually like it, but I don't hate it either.
Roshana: Overall, it's better than when I was with the Eremites, because I don't have to deal with those stiff researchers anymore.
Roshana: Ha, it's funny that even the power of alcohol is greater than knowledge.
Roshana: Wait and see — a glass of something stronger is enough for those researchers to abandon rules.
 See you.
Roshana: Yeah.
