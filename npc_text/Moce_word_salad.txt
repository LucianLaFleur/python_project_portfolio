Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Canticles of Harmony.


Moce: Stay on your guard, citizen!
 What are you doing?
Moce: Me? As you can see, I'm busy dealing with the barbarian threat! According to the reports I've received, there've been traces of them skulking about here.
Moce: This is no trivial matter! Vigilance must be maintained until reinforcements arrive!
Moce: If there is anything else, please bring it up with my adjutant, citizen.
 A child, out here on their own...
Moce: Hmm? A child? Where from? Did some new legionnaire disobey orders and bring their family into the camp again...?
Moce: *sigh* Dominus Cassiodor is far too gentle with these greenhorns. If this were to have happened three decades prior, a Tribunus would've had a whip out by now...
 Have there been any suspicious happenings lately?
Moce: Not at present. that said, the barbarians are akin to cunning beasts. Ever will they strike when your guard has been lowered, for surprise is their greatest weapon!
Moce: By methods most foul they infiltrate our cities and seek out our secrets. Even the slightest lapse in discipline may lead to catastrophe.
Moce: *sigh* Thirty years ago, when I followed Dominus Boethius to conquest in the far north, they were but a pack of primitives without any such skill for subterfuge. Where did they learn these tricks?
 Thirty years ago... Your parents wouldn't even have been born yet...
Moce: Hmm? What did you just say, citizen? I fear my hearing's been going as I age.
Moce: *sigh* Time truly is cruel. During the conquest of Bituria, I could hear the barbarians' bells calling them to muster from miles away.
 Farewell.
Moce: Fare ye well, citizen! You may report suspicious people to me at any time!

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Canticles of Harmony.


Moce: Ugh, this is soooo boring. My dream was more interesting than life here. I wanna go see the outside world!
 What sort of dream would be that interesting?
Moce: A very, very long one! Uh, I don't really remember much of it anymore, though. Did I have it yesterday? Or have I had it before...
Moce: I dreamed that the town was invaded, and I joined up with the Gardes, becoming an awesome officer - even my dad had to listen to me!
Moce: I would say, "Giovanni, bring me my gun," and he could only say, "Sir, yes, sir!"
Moce: In the past, when I would dream, I would wake up once I realized that something didn't add up. But that dream was perfect. I was so happy, I could've played in there forever.
Moce: I guess it's because of my recent desire to go out on an adventure.
 Is Petrichor that boring?
Moce: Exactly! Nothing ever changes around here, and everyone's okay with that... If it wasn't like this, Uncle would never have left!
Moce: I wanted to go see the outside world... I heard people in town say that Sumeru's an interesting place, with its rainforests and deserts... and ancient fortresses and temples!
Moce: Here, it's all water everywhere you look... Ah, how I wish I could go on an adventure!
 Your uncle?
(If World Quest Latecoming Homecoming has not been completed)

Moce: That's right. I don't know his name, and he's never written us any letters... Dad always calls him "that blockhead," or "that guy"...
Moce: But he's gotta be a pretty awesome guy to have bucked with tradition and left town by himself to Sumeru! Better than Dad, who only ever talks about family and duty and stuff like that...
Moce: Uh, hmm. Did I say too much? Keep that stuff a secret and don't tell Dad, alright? Thanks!
(If Latecoming Homecoming has been completed)

Moce: That's right! My uncle was in Sumeru before, but he came back in the last couple of days.
Moce: Dad says that Uncle didn't get anything done other than get himself into a bunch of debt before returning, but I bet that's a lie.
Moce: He just said that because he doesn't want me to leave town!
 The outside world isn't that interesting either.
Moce: Eh? Wouldn't you have had to see every kind of other place before you can say that?
