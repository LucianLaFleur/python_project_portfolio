Profile[]
Aurelie ran a theater troupe in Fontaine. She took in street urchins, training them in performance, and treating them like her brothers and sisters; she helped pay for Dulphy's medicine when her family abandoned her, and took in Lauwick, the son of a murderer. Pauleau was romantically interested in her, though she declined his proposal. Her troupe was frequently struggling financially; after learning of a sponsorship from her fellow member Vilmant (which he had not answered because the sponsorship also had Sinthe), she decided to talk to the businessman herself and refused the offer. This drew the businessman's ire and made Aurelie his next kidnapping target. While being detained in his hideout, she maintained her journal almost to her very end. Her possessions would initially remain in his hideout until the Gardes took it as evidence and kept in the Palais Mermonia for safekeeping.
The troupe was left devastated by her demise and sought to finish her final play, "The Little Oceanid," in her honor before they would disband, but they had issues finishing the script as her death had impacted them greatly. At the same time, Dulphy fell ill again, prompting Lauwick to submit a commission at the Adventurers' Guild to find a replacement actress. The Traveler answered the request and decided to have Furina help, though she had declined at first out of a reluctance to act. She had a change of heart shortly after their visit, but agreed to serve as a consultant and the troupe was eventually able to come to terms with her death and finish her play.
