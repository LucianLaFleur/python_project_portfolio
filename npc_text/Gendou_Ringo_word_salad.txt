Gendou Ringo's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Gendou Ringo is in charge of the Fortune Slip Box and gives players their fortune based on the Bamboo Slip drawn that day.
Before Gendou Ringo's Strange Fortune Slips is started, the person acting as "Gendou Ringo" is a Shuumatsuban member who would later come to use the codename "Momoyo." During and after the Hidden Exploration Objective and the The Very Special Fortune Slip quest line, the ex-Fatuus Lyudochka Snezhevna takes over as the new "Gendou Ringo."

Lyudochka[]
Gendou Ringo has a much more approachable and friendly attitude toward the Traveler and Paimon in general and acts much more like a typical Shrine Maiden.

Appearance[]
Gendou Ringo wears the standard shrine maiden uniform consisting of a white kosode and red hakama, white tabi socks, and regular okobo sandals with red straps. She has blue eyes and black hair cut into a chin-length bob, and although not so visible in-game, the front portions of her hair are separated with dark brown accessories.

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(First interaction)
Gendou Ringo: You want a fortune slip?
Paimon: Geez, she's so cold.
 Yes, I'd like one...
Gendou Ringo: Got it. Here's how it goes. First, shake this... thing over here.
 Isn't it called Fortune Slip Box?
Gendou Ringo: Yes. A Bamboo Slip will drop out from it. Give it to me, and I'll give you a matching strip of paper.
 I'm pretty sure they say it's a Fortune Slip...
Gendou Ringo: Whatever.
Paimon: Paimon's got a question! If... What do we do if we get one that means bad luck?
Gendou Ringo: It's fate. You got a problem with that? Huh?
Paimon: Eh!?
 Isn't there that shelf-like thing outside we can use to...
Gendou Ringo: Tsk.
Paimon: Did she seriously just say "tsk"?
Gendou Ringo: Let me see... Oh right, so it's like this. "Tie the inauspicious slip onto the Fortune Slip Hanger to change ill fortune to good"...
Gendou Ringo: Ah, right! If you get a slip with ill fortune, just tie it to that shelf, that'll do.
Gendou Ringo: Huh, what a bunch of... No, sorry. We at the Grand Narukami Shrine are most gentle indeed. Even if you should draw a slip with bad luck, you shall have a chance to turn it around.
Paimon: Something about this doesn't seem right...
Paimon: Let's go draw a fortune slip, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!
(After drawing a Bamboo Slip for the first time)
Gendou Ringo: Give me that bamboo slip.
 R—Right.
Paimon: This shrine really seems to lack the whole divine affection thing, huh...
Gendou Ringo: Here.
Paimon: Let's see how our luck's going...
Gendou Ringo: Ah, yes. You can only draw one fortune slip each day. Please remember that.
Gendou Ringo: It's too tiring otherwise... Wait, no. If not, you won't be able to use the Fortune Slip Hanger to... No, that's not right either. What was I supposed to say?
Gendou Ringo: "Fortune slips are the manifestation of our archon's will. It is our place as mortals to respect it and do all we can."
Gendou Ringo: See? Elegantly put. So please remember, you can only draw one fortune slip each day.
