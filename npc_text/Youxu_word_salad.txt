Dialogue[]

Youxu: This is the all-important Golden House. Please tread lightly here, or you'll make me nervous.
 Who might you be?
Youxu: I'm Youxu of the Millelith, and thus far, nothing untoward has happened on my watch.
Youxu: If you go to Yujing Terrace, you'll find my older brother Fengyan on patrol there.
Youxu: He's the current Millelith instructor, and is an example to me. Still, I believe that his position will be mine someday soon. *chuckles*
 Tell me about the Golden House.
(Before completing "Turning Point")
Youxu: This is where an entire continent's worth of coins are minted. To say that it is the most important place in Liyue is no overstatement.
Youxu: As a citizen of Liyue, I pray that this place will remain forever safe. But as a Millelith...
Youxu: I wish that it would allow me to do something big. I'd like to believe that some foolhardy fellows out here have designs on this place.
(After completing "Turning Point")
Youxu: *sigh* I'm still frustrated... When the adepti paid us a visit, our forces were mustered and redeployed throughout the city to strengthen the guard...
Youxu: We only found out later via reports that the Golden House had been attacked. I knew that such a day would come.
Youxu: I was just following orders, so I wasn't blamed, but... but, this was an opportunity of a lifetime, and I let it slip away just like that...
Youxu: Now it feels like I've been guarding this place for this long, but all for naught... With my skills, I could surely have stopped the person who broke in.
Youxu: Hmm, you look skeptical. Don't you believe me?
 See you around.
Youxu: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail!
