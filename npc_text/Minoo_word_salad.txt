Minoo: Only kids who haven't grown up would believe in stories about Aranara.
 About the Aranara...
Minoo: They're fantastical creatures from fairytales. You must keep that in mind.
Minoo: If you still believe in the Aranara, you haven't grown up yet.
 What kind of stories?
Minoo: Many! Haven't you heard?
Minoo: Like the "Brave Aranara." They might be small, but very brave.
Minoo: Despite their fear of fire, Aranara would protect the forest... *sob* Putting out wildfires with their bodies...
Minoo: *sob* Aranara...
Minoo: Wait, no, that's just a childhood story! Minoo is older now and doesn't believe in that anymore...
Minoo: *sob*
 See you.
Minoo: From now on, Minoo shall be a courageous adult.
