Dialogue[]

Furat: The environment here is so nice that even I feel like staying and attending classes.
 Studying is a good thing.
Furat: Hmm... In my opinion, it's half-and-half.
Furat: If you are good at studying, you don't have to worry about making a living; but if you are too good, I hear there's a risk of going mad?
Furat: So, it's best for an ordinary person like me to just look for a job that suits me.
Furat: Oh right, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm a supplier, and I mainly provide Pardis Dhyai with basic supplies.
Furat: You can contact me too, if you need any daily necessities.
 I'll keep that in mind.
Furat: Good! Looking forward to hearing from you then.
Furat: If not for the business, we can still shake hands for becoming friends. Please accept this as a gift from me. I'm sure it'll be useful someday.
(Obtain  Nagadus Emerald Fragment)
 See you.
Furat: Bye!
