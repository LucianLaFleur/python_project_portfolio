Profile[]
Idyia is an Oceanid,[4][5] a caretaker of the Veluriyam Mirage, and a friend of Alice, who agreed to invite Klee to the Mirage for the summer. She fled Fontaine after the death of the previous Hydro Archon, Egeria, and escaped to Sumeru and met Alice, who granted her a wish to be away from everyone else by sending her to the desert of Sumeru and giving her the Veluriyam Mirage domain. Over time, several people came across the bottle and their wishes were granted within its confines by Idyia. Afterward, they would leave gifts for her which she used to power the domain, having the Hydro Eidolons mimic them.

Appearance[]
Idyia has watery-blue hair and eyes, and clothes in matching color and fashion reminiscent of Mondstadt and/or Fontaine.

Dialogue[]

Idyia: "Welcome to the Veluriyam Mirage. I hope you can relax and enjoy some respite from your tiring journey."
Idyia: That's how I would have greeted you if things had been different... *sigh* It's hard to believe how much has happened.
Idyia: Since everything's fixed now, I thought... Better late than never. What do you think? Pretty professional, huh?
 About Preprints...
Idyia: Uh... do you want me to explain the underlying theory? I don't actually know that much about it. In short, a Preprint is like an idea...
Idyia: Think of it like how a plant should grow is imprinted in its seed, or how a bird will spread its wings is determined while it's still in its egg.
Idyia: Things follow these instincts and rules that are programmed into them and become that which we see around us. Perhaps the blueprints of all things were created at the very beginning.
Idyia: A Preprint is like those blueprints, and the light reflected through the bottle transforms them into the entire Veluriyam Mirage. Ah, but this kind of magic only works within the confines of the bottle.
 About Oceanids...
Idyia: Oh, are you wondering why we fled Fontaine? It feels like it happened a lifetime ago...
Idyia: The reason for our flight... it would be the "water". The waters of Fontaine changed, and to the Oceanids, now the waters there are full of... pain and hatred...?
Idyia: For us, if we wanted to live, fleeing was the best choice. Oh, it was then that became [sic] lost and fainted in the desert...
Idyia: I must say, this desert is really just too vast!
 About Rhodeia...
Idyia: Huh, Rhodeia? Have you met her?
Idyia: Looks like she finally found a place for herself... Qingce Village? Is that in Liyue? You really have gone far away, Rhodeia...
 Keep up the good work!
Idyia: Yeah, I will... I will work hard! And please do enjoy the humid environment here. You'll rarely come across such a place in the desert!
