 Fishing...
Media:VO Muli 01.ogg "I wanna go fishing!"

Dialogue[]

Muli: Hello there, tall guest. Do you know how to fish?
 Haven't fished much...
Muli: Then let's go fishing together! Fishing is one of the most interesting things in the world!
 I'm a master baiter!
Muli: Really? In that case, do you... think it's possible to fish up jadeware?
 Why would you even think that...
Muli: I love fishing, especially when it's with Qiongjiu!
Muli: But father says that someone must take over our family's jade business...
Muli: So it would be perfect if I could fish up some jadeware! Don't you think so too!?
Muli: Or maybe I'll ask Little Mao to learn how to make jadeware while I go fishing with Qiongjiu! That would be great too!
 See you.
Muli: Bye! I'm going to continue thinking about fishing!
