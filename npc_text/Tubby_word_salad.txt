Trivia[]
It is possible Ganyu has met Tubby before the creation of the Traveler's Serenitea Pot, as she refers to her as Rain Calmer during some of her dialogue, even if Tubby has not yet reached a rank where she has remembered her Adeptus name.
It is possible the "Golden-eyed Adeptus" that Tubby remembers meeting, mentioned in the World Quest A Teapot to Call Home: Part II, was Rex Lapis, as he is known to have the same, golden-amber coloured eyes regardless of which vessel he takes.
Tubby is mentioned in the descriptions of the following 55 Furnishings: Courtyard Wall: All in a Row Dodoco's Dodo Stove Euphonium Unbound: Winding Leisure Device: Confused Confuzzlement Leisure Device: On the Pulse Leisure Device: Rhythmic Sprinter Mondstadt Mansion: Windward Manor Scenic Corridor: Sylvan Stroll Speedy Rhythm: Antler Brown Speedy Rhythm: Mallow Mauve Speedy Rhythm: Ultramarine Speedy Rhythm: Verdance Sub-Space Boulder: Desert Wastes Sub-Space Boulder: Floating Precipice Sub-Space Boulder: Gravel Sub-Space Boulder: Rocky Bulwark Sub-Space Boulder: Seat of Mist Veranda Corner: Pavilion's Watch Leisure Device: Maximum Motivation Pavilion: Stargazer's Shelter A Theater's Dream of Flowers Longing in the Tranquil Court Domed Gate: Forest Tune Leisure Device: Bouncy Tubby Leisure Device: Bouncy Chubby Lingering Moment Leisure Device: Puffy Tubby Leisure Device: Twang-Bang-Bang Sub-Space Waypoint Azure Crane Black-Back Hound Snow Finch Dendro Crystalfly Crow Bluecrown Finch Bluethunder Weasel Darkwing Goose Desert Fox Dusk Bird Emerald Finch Flatcrest Fulmar Burgundy Umbrellafinch Kitsune Ocean Crab Red-Finned Unagi Scarab Sapphire Slate Umbrellafinch Snow Fox Squirrel Sun Crab Violetgold Angler Gull Motorized Autonomous Fonta Vending Machine: Modified "High Stone Platform" "Happy Times"
