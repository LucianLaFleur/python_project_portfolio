Dialogue[]

Farzaneh: Hi there, can I help you with something? Please make it quick if you can. Standing too long in one place makes me dizzy...
 Do you need me to take you to the hospital?
Farzaneh: Oh, it's not like that. I'm just not quite used to life on land yet.
Farzaneh: I run an armed commercial shipping company. I used to serve as a lieutenant captain in Beidou's Crux Fleet, and made quite a bit of money doing so.
Farzaneh: I haven't ventured back out to sea since starting my own commercial shipping company.
Farzaneh: But I'm struggling to get used to being back on land, maybe because I spent so long at sea. I have to walk back and forth to avoid getting dizzy...
 I'll leave you to it, then.
Farzaneh: Then I'll get back to my walk.
