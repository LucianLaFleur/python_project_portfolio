Story[]
Miyazaki was the Vice Armory Officer of Tatarasuna when Mikoshi Nagamasa was its Inspector, and taught Nagamasa about the intricacies of steelwork and bladesmithing.[1] He was mentioned to have discussed bladesmithing with Katsuragi, Nagamasa's yoriki, and was later present when Nagamasa forged the Daitatara Nagamasa — the blade that would later become known as the Katsuragikiri Nagamasa.[2]
Miyazaki penned Rather Aged Notes #6, remarking on his mixed feelings about Nagamasa, who slew Katsuragi and indirectly caused Nozomu's death. In the note, he also indicates that Kinjiro placed the forging blueprint for Katsuragikiri Nagamasa in The Arsenal.

Trivia[]
The NPC Miyazaki Saburou is likely a descendant of Miyazaki's, or at least shares the same lineage. This also likely makes Miyazaki a practitioner of the Miyazaki Art, one of the swordsmithing traditions in Tatarasuna and the one which Saburou practices.
