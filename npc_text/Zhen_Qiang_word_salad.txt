Dialogue[]

 Zhen Qiang: Hey, who're you?
 Zhen Qiang: If you've nothing else to do, don't come here looking for trouble!
 What are you doing?
 Zhen Qiang: Not much. I'm just watching this crane on orders from my boss.
 Zhen Qiang: Truth be told, there isn't all that much to do. I mean, what's this crane supposed to do, grow legs and run off?
 What does this crane do, anyway?
 Zhen Qiang: Hey, don't touch it however you like. This contraption isn't something an outsider can use. We boatmen rely on this to help us transport cargo.
 Zhen Qiang: And our boss has said that if anything goes wrong with that crane, our heads will be bolted to it, and...
 Zhen Qiang: ...Well, whatever you do, just don't touch it.
 Sorry for bothering you.
 Zhen Qiang: Remember, don't get too close to that crane!

Trivia[]
