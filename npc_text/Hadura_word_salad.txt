Profile[]
Hadura was a member of the Schwanenritter, a division led by Knight Marshal Anfortas which helped fight against the Abyssal monsters during the cataclysm and led surviving Khaenri'ahns to Sumeru, traveling from the Girdle of the Sands to Devantaka Mountain. Anfortas and Hadura were the only Schwanenritter left when Hadura betrayed Anfortas and destroyed important machinery, leading to Hadura's death at Anfortas' hands.

Story[]
As a Garrison Commander, Hadura gave orders to activate some self-defense systems to assist with evacuating Khaenri'ahn citizens to the surface.[1] As a Knight Commander, Hadura was bestowed with the epithet "Sentinel of the Golden Hall" for leading a successful operation in stalling the beasts.[2][Note 1]
Later on, the Schwanenritter's leader, Anfortas, went to execute Hadura for betraying them and causing irreversible damage to a machine; in the ensuing fight, Anfortas lost his left eye. Despite this, because Hadura was the last remaining Schwanenritter by that point, they were given a proper Knight's funeral anyways. Records related to this event were left behind in the Ruin Golem at Devantaka Mountain.[3] Nagarjuna, the leader of the scholars who would become the Order of Skeptics, fought alongside the "heroes of Dahri" in the rainforest;[4] Hadura may have been one such hero.

Legacy[]
Klingsor was Hadura's descendant and a member of the Order of Skeptics hundreds of years ago. However, he resented the treatment Khaenri'ahns received for Khaenri'ah's involvement in causing the cataclysm, citing Hadura's efforts in subduing the monsters. This led him to doubt the Order's origin stories and believe Nagarjuna had hidden the truth.[5]
While accompanying a group of Sumeru Akademiya scholars to Khaenri'ahn ruins, he eventually embraced the power of the Abyss and became an Abyss Herald,[6] causing a series of events which would eventually culminate in the World Quest Series Khvarena of Good and Evil.

Notes[]

↑ Khaenri'ahn military hierarchy is currently unknown, so it is unclear which is the higher rank between Garrison Commander and Knight Commander.
