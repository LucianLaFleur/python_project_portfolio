Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Nilou's Story Quest Act I: To the Wise


Sheikh Zubayr: Hello. If you're here for an interview. I'll have to refuse.
 And you are...
Sheikh Zubayr: I'm a playwright and manager. I run the Zubayr Theater in this tree hollow.
Sheikh Zubayr: In addition, I also do some composing, choreography, stage design, and action direction.
Sheikh Zubayr: It's a small troupe. Pretty much everyone other than Kourosh wears several hats.
Sheikh Zubayr: So if it isn't about anything important, I'll have to ask that you not bother the staff here, including myself.
 About Kourosh...
Sheikh Zubayr: Him, he's a man of mediocre talent. His movements on stage are stiff and his singing is less in tune than Swoof's.
Sheikh Zubayr: His only strength is his determination. To this day, he still hasn't given up his job as an actor.
Sheikh Zubayr: I'm a person with high standard, but I don't give up on persistent students. As long as he can still accept criticism, I'll continue to instruct him.
Sheikh Zubayr: After all, I can't expect everyone to be as gifted as Nilou.
Sheikh Zubayr: Ah, that reminds me, I still have more to discuss with him regarding the lines of the new script...
 See you.
Sheikh Zubayr: Bye.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Nilou's Story Quest Act I: To the Wise


Sheikh Zubayr: Ah, it's you. Welcome, welcome!
 Duel
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Sheikh Zubayr: You lost, now leave. I still have a lot of things to do.
(If the player wins the match)

Sheikh Zubayr: ...I've got work to do. Okay. Don't bother me unless it's an emergency.
 How have things been going for you recently?
Sheikh Zubayr: Well, quite the same as always. I am the resident playwright and manager, and so I am... managing, haha!
Sheikh Zubayr: We are a rather small troupe, so pretty much everyone other than Kourosh wears several hats. I also do some composing, choreography, stage design, and action direction on the side.
Sheikh Zubayr: However, we have had new joiners recently, which has given me some time to focus on something... And of course, one can't complain about the added bustle.
 About Kourosh...
Sheikh Zubayr: Him, he's a man of mediocre talent. His movements on stage are stiff and his singing is less in tune than Swoof's.
Sheikh Zubayr: His only strength is his determination. To this day, he still hasn't given up on being an actor.
Sheikh Zubayr: I'm a person with high standards, but I don't give up on persistent students. As long as he can still accept criticism, I'll continue to instruct him.
Sheikh Zubayr: After all, I can't expect everyone to be as gifted as Nilou.
Sheikh Zubayr: Ah, that reminds me, I still have more to discuss with him regarding the lines of the new script...
 How are Nilou and Inayah doing?
Sheikh Zubayr: Nilou is teaching her to dance as we speak. However, I must say that it hasn't been easy. Dance is something that is best learned from young, I fear.
Sheikh Zubayr: Still, Inayah works so hard. Beyond the tasks that Nilou sets her, she trains independently as well.
Sheikh Zubayr: I daresay that with her current progress, she may be good enough to take the stage in but a few years.
Sheikh Zubayr: I daren't imagine, however, how many times longer that period would have been without the tutelage of someone as gifted and patient as Nilou.
 See you.
Sheikh Zubayr: Do come again.

I've tried juggling before, but I always end up catching the balls with my head... Mr. Zubayr and everyone else just laughed at me. They probably thought I had really good hand-eye coordination. Hee-hee, I've been exposed.
Trivia[]
A "sheikh" is a title of honor given to a man in the Arab world, typically one who is a leader or respected elder in his community. It is often used to refer to a tribal leader, religious leader, or a leader of a clan or family. In some cases, the title can also be given to a learned or distinguished person.
This may explain why he can afford to fund, manage, and maintain his own theater.
Etymology[]
"Sheikhzubayr" is a pun on Shakespeare.
The name likely originates from an obscure theory that Shakespeare was actually an Arab writer by the name of Shaykh Zubayr.
