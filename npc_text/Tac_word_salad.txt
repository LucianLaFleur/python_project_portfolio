Profile[]
Tac is a dockworker willing to be hired for work for the Rite of Parting.
While willing to negotiate his hiring rate, he will get angry if the Traveler continuously lowballs an offer. He will also initially refuse to go pick up his payment from Childe himself, citing that it's not worth it without a detour fee. After receiving the fee, he will guarantee that he won't be late to start work at Yujing Terrace.

Trivia[]
Tic, Tac, and Toe are named after the game tic-tac-toe. They are also connected with the achievement "Ticked, Tacked, and Towed".
His dialogue assumes you reached the dialogue branch for having too little money (which brings up Childe), but also tried bartering with him. This isn't possible during the quest.
