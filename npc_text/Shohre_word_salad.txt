Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing ???)
Shohre: Hello, what do you need?
 Are you a matra?
Shohre: Oh? So you don't exactly know what I do?
Shohre: No worries. As a matter of fact, the fewer people who want my help the better, for it means that we have a good academic atmosphere here.
Shohre: To be surrounded by books... That sounds rather nice to me. I'd say there's no simpler life than one whereby your only goal is to study.
Shohre: Even I sometimes want to borrow a book or two while looking at the tidy shelves in the House of Daena.
Shohre: But that's just a thought. I'm too impatient to read. I can apply for access to the general summary in the Akasha if I really want to know about something.
 Sorry to bother you... I think I should go.
Shohre: Oh, see you.

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After completing ???)
Shohre: Hello, what do you need?
 Are you a matra?
Shohre: Oh? So you don't exactly know what I do, huh?
Shohre: No worries. As a matter of fact, that's a good thing. The fewer people who come to talk to me about work, the better — that means our academic environment is a healthy one.
Shohre: A life surrounded by books... That does sound rather nice. I'd say that there's no simpler form of life than one where your only goal is to study.
Shohre: Even I sometimes want to borrow a book or two when I look at the tidy shelves in the House of Daena.
Shohre: But that's just a thought. I know myself — I'm far too impatient to read.
 Sorry to bother you... I think I should go.
Shohre: Oh, see you.

Shohre: Honestly, I expected a great deal of problems to follow the Akademiya's celebration. I was even ready to head back to the office and prepare for overtime.
Shohre: But there really haven't been that many people seeking me out. Even the General Mahamatra is on break... Hm. I'm just going to keep resting here.
