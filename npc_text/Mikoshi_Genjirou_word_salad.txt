Mikoshi Genjirou's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Genichirou and Genjirou are both descendants of the Mikoshi Clan, a clan with oni heritage. Genjirou views his elder brother as a disappointment and a dullard, and as such believes that it is his duty to uphold the clan's future.
Genjirou is a direct superior of Hanbei, who was in charge of overseeing Mikage Furnace. Hanbei's inability to take decisive action when issues arose at the Furnace, which were ultimately resolved by Xavier and the Traveler, was noted by Genjirou and reported to his own superior. Genjirou then told Toranosuke about Hanbei's dismissal from his position under the guise of being sent to Sumeru as part of their foreign attaché.[1]

Dialogue[]

Mikoshi Genjirou: Hello! If you're here on government business, please tell me who you are, why you are here, and give me the delivery deadline.
Mikoshi Genjirou: If you are not here for business, then I'm sorry, but I have no time for chitchat.
 Who are you?
Mikoshi Genjirou: I'm Mikoshi Genjirou, a government official affiliated with the Tenryou Commission.
Mikoshi Genjirou: What... So you are not here to take over my shift? Then please leave me alone.
Mikoshi Genjirou: An elite like me is always either hard at work or honing my skills. This is a world in which only the best survive, after all. Only the most excellent will stick around.
 What are your thoughts about your work?
Mikoshi Genjirou: I believe that everyone should take their own job seriously. This is the only way to keep the whole system functioning properly.
Mikoshi Genjirou: Like those people from the army. They still haven't been able to defeat Sangonomiya after such a long time. A laughable lot!
Mikoshi Genjirou: From what I heard, the Sangonomiya troops have employed some "dog" as their commander... If that's true, then that Kujou Sara really is good for nothing!
 Is Mikoshi Genichirou your elder brother?
Mikoshi Genjirou: Tsk... That incompetent loser. He's content with just owning a small shop. He is still the same after all these years. So sluggish.
Mikoshi Genjirou: I knew that he wouldn't accomplish anything ever since he was little. And as expected, the future of the Mikoshi clan is still mine to uphold.
 Goodbye...
Mikoshi Genjirou: Farewell.
