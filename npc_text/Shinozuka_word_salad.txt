Dialogue[]

Shinozuka: Ah! Who are you?! And how did you get here?
Shinozuka: Eek... Sorry about that, it just feels a little spooky around here. Am I thinking on it too much?
 What are you doing here?
Shinozuka I am a horror novel writer. I've recently hit a wall in my inspiration and it's been hindering my work.
Shinozuka I heard rumors that said that there are ghosts in this deserted temple, so I came to see what I could find.
Shinozuka But I immediately realized that this was no place for the living... Even the temperature feels lower here...
Shinozuka Ah, what should I do? Should I go inside the temple and have a look? I need to prepare myself. I need to be brave...
 Silly-churl, billy-churl...
Shinozuka Geez... what an eerie song! P—Please stop singing it!
Shinozuka Y-You're a living person, right? You don't seem to be see-through...
Shinozuka But if you're here, maybe... *shivers* Ahh, it's getting a little too scary in here...
Shinozuka I'm just here for some inspiration for my horror novel! I—I didn't mean to offend you!
 Sorry... Just take care of yourself, alright?
Shinozuka Huh? You're not a ghost? Whew... Thanks for the reminder, but please don't scare me like that again.
Shinozuka Wait... Can you sing the song that you were singing again?
Shinozuka It has an eerie feel to it, can you teach it to me? Maybe I can find some inspiration if I sing while I'm writing my novel.
 Be careful. Goodbye.
Shinozuka: Hmm, should I go into the temple or not...

Trivia[]
The "eerie song" that the Traveler sings is Hu Tao's "Hilitune."
