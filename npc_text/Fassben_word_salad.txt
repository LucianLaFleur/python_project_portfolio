Dialogue[]
Windblume's Breath[]

(Before the event started)
Fassben: My Kamera's in pretty good shape.
Fassben: C'mon, Fassben, you can do this — think about the Kamera Club!
(During the event)
Fassben: The photo-taking is in your capable hands, Traveler!
Fassben: If we can call this a job well done, Cyrus should be more inclined to approve our request to set up a Kamera Club.
Fassben: And as long as we can set it up, we should be able to attract more Kamera enthusiasts and further refine the art of taking pictures!
Fassben: Perhaps we might even be able to invite hobbyists from other nations...
Fassben: W—Well, would you look at that? I'm getting rather ahead of myself, aren't I? Focus, man, focus — focus on the work at hand.
