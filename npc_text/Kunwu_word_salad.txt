Story[]
Originally a scholar who intended to gain admittance to Sumeru Akademiya in the pursuit of knowledge, Kunwu changed tracks upon coming into possession of the Sundial of Enduring Jade.[1] Upon discovering he could find no flaws in the sundial's design, he decided to become a craftsman himself in order to challenge its designer, Morax, and create an item as equally flawless.
He eventually created the Kunwu Series of weapons.

Trivia[]
During the third Closed Beta Test (Version 0.9.9), there was a polearm named Kunwu's Iris Rift, which detailed how Kunwu became an adeptus and forged this spear. The polearm was removed in Version 1.0, and its assets were repurposed into Vortex Vanquisher, with a different name, description, and stats.
It is likely that Kun Jun is his descendant, given that he comes from a family of famous artisans and shares a surname with Kunwu.
