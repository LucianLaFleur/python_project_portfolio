Dialogue[]

Aunt Qiao: You look weary, child. Why not take a rest?
 What are you doing?
Aunt Qiao: Oh, just helping out with the stalls as well as an old lady can.
Aunt Qiao: I know all the vendors here very well. The ones who sell cups of tea, leaf tea and tea eggs.
Aunt Qiao: When something comes up, they all feel safest asking me to watch their stalls for them.
 Goodbye.
Aunt Qiao: Goodbye, child.

Waterborn Poetry[]

Aunt Qiao: Even Stone Gate is bustling now... Haha, now that's a sight!
Aunt Qiao: You look weary, child. Why not take a rest?

Trivia[]
Aunt Qiao may have written the second remark on the ad for Pops Zhou's Tea on the Stone Gate Bulletin Board. The second note was written by someone who has lived in the area for over 40 years and knows Pops Zhou (and his tea) well, which fits with Aunt Qiao's dialogue about how she is familiar with all the vendors at Stone Gate.
