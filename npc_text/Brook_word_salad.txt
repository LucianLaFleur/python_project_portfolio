Dialogue[]

Brook: Hi, did the beautiful fragrance of my cooking entice you over here? Hehehe.
 I would like to buy something to eat.
Brook: Sure thing. How about a fresh steak? There's nothing better in all of Mondstadt.

 Who are you? (Only available before completing Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip)
Brook: You don't know who I am? I'm Brook. My meat-based recipes are very well known in Mondstadt.
 We meet again! (After completing Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip)
Brook: Hey, aren't you the assistant for Xiangling, the chef from Liyue?
Brook: You couldn't possibly be here by coincidence. I've got it! She must want to challenge me again. I am "Mondstadt's Rotisseur Queen," after all.
Brook: Oh... That's not it, huh? Well seeing as she already beat me last time, I guess challenging me again wouldn't prove much.
 What are you doing?
Brook: If you want the absolutely freshest meat possible, it has to go straight from the hunt to the kitchen with not a moment wasted.
Brook: That's the reason I moved to Springvale.
Brook: Of course, I do sell the vast majority of my cooking...
Brook: But the single freshest piece of meat in the day? I normally keep it as a treat for myself.
 That smells great...
Brook: Haha, of course. This steak was made by me, Brook, after all!
Brook: I can say with confidence that I make the best steaks in Mondstadt.
Brook: Have you tried some before? If you haven't, you can get a sample now.
Brook: Don't be shy. This is flavor that will revolutionize your taste buds!
(Obtain  Delicious Steak ×4)
 Goodbye.
Brook: Bon appétit... I mean, goodbye!

Event Dialogue[]
Unreconciled Stars[]

Brook: Have you made any progress in your investigation into the meteorite strike yet? You'll get to the bottom of it. I'm sure of it.
Brook: The victims will probably be ravenous when they do eventually wake up, won't they? So, I'd better start preparing some meals for them.

Windblume's Breath[]

Brook: Oh, did the wondrous fragrance of my cooked meat draw another? Hehehe.
Brook: You can really tell it's the holidays when the streets are full in this little town. Even outlanders have come to visit.
Brook: I thought he was here to ask for directions, but instead he surprised me when he inquired if I knew how to make any dishes using Philanemo Mushrooms.
Brook: Cooking with Philanemo Mushrooms... isn't impossible. But at most, they just accent the meat.
