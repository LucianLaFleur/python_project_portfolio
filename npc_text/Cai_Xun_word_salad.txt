Dialogue[]

Cai Xun: Welcome to Liyue. How may the Millelith be of service to you today?
 Tell me more about the Millelith.
Cai Xun: "While rock stays hard, the mountain shall never fall; while the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail."
Cai Xun: The Millelith are under the Liyue Qixing's command. You could say we're the city's public security officers.
Cai Xun: We're here to handle minor matters such as theft and other disturbances of the peace. We also stand ready as Liyue's firm shield in the case of a monster attack.
Cai Xun: Never hesitate to call on us if you need assistance of any kind.
 Have you seen someone who looks very much like me?
Cai Xun: Hmm, this is a difficult question to answer.
Cai Xun: It's not that I'm lazy and don't observe the people who come and go, but...
Cai Xun: Liyue Harbor is the most prosperous city among the seven nations. There are just too many people who move to and from it every day — it's impossible to remember them all.
Cai Xun: I'll help you keep a lookout, but don't get your hopes too high...
 Goodbye.
Cai Xun: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail!
