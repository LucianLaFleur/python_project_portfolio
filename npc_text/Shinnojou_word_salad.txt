Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available after completing Ritou Escape Plan and before completing The Firmiana Leaf Falls.


Shinnojou: Hello, Traveler! What is your business at the Kanjou Commission today? Or... are you here to look for Miss Hiiragi?
 You seem energetic.
Shinnojou: Haha, of course! I live each day seriously, and I'm always looking to improve myself.
Shinnojou: When we were escorting the lady previously, I learned that my ability and skills still need a lot of improvement. If I want to protect her, I must further hone them!
Shinnojou: N—Now, don't get the wrong idea. I'm not harboring any illicit thoughts about her. She is not only a lady of nobility, but she already has a lover...
Shinnojou: Uhh... A—Anyway, my greatest goal is to carry out my duty as best as I can, and to that end, I shall do my best for the Kanjou Commission and for Miss Hiiragi.
 Do your best.
Shinnojou: I will! Goodbye.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing The Firmiana Leaf Falls.


Shinnojou: Hello there, Traveler. We meet again.
 You don't look too well.
Shinnojou: Come on, how could that be? Don't worry about me, I'm very much fine. Honestly, it's like a weight's been taken off my shoulders.
Shinnojou: And our Lady is in exceptional spirits right now. I can rest assured knowing that she's in top shape.
Shinnojou: It's just that... Well, never you mind.
 It's just that?
Shinnojou: Well, you know, this all started when I impulsive charged up to stop her. Now that I think about it, it was so presumptuous of me...
Shinnojou: But our Lady really is a gentle soul. She even came to thank me specifically after the dust settled.
Shinnojou: *sigh* I no longer have any regrets. It's just... feelings that you spent so much time nursing... They don't go away so easily.
 Well, I wish you all the best.
Shinnojou: Thank you. I'll get back on my feet as soon as possible.

Event Dialogue[]
Hues of the Violet Garden[]

Shinnojou: I flipped through some of my latest diary entries, and page after page is filled to the margins with sadness... You couldn't even tell that I was a positive guy on the up and up before. *sigh* This is no way to motivate oneself.
Shinnojou: I wonder, though... Would such tragic developments make for a good novel?
Shinnojou: You know, with the pauper lad unable in the end to win the hand of the fair, rich young lady...? Aha, ahaha...
Shinnojou: Maybe I might have a shot at getting published if I were to organize my internal journey into a novel...
