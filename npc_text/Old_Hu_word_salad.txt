Old Hu passed away when Hu Tao was thirteen years old, and she conducted his "grand" funeral ten days later. After the funeral, Hu Tao searched for his spirit in Wuwang Hill, with no success. She realized that her grandfather had already passed through the border between life and death, due to his lack of regrets about his life and his acceptance of his own death. Inspired by her grandfather's example to live life to the fullest, Hu Tao returned home where she discovered she received a Pyro Vision.

Appearance[]
Old Hu was described as "large and musclebound," with a head two sizes larger than Hu Tao's. He wore the hat that Hu Tao currently wears, before it was passed down to her and modified to fit her head.[1]
