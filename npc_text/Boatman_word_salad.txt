"Boatman"'s locationAdditional context
Profile[]
The "Boatman" is a supernatural spirit, specifically a psychopomp, responsible for ferrying dead souls to the afterlife aboard his silver skiff "across a glittering river, into the land of dreams". He will appear once the fog and time loop curse at Tsurumi Island is resolved to bring the souls of the islanders towards what he describes as "the moon-mansion that golden burns."[1] However, he is stumped that some of the souls still have their lingering attachment and will not board his boat. He apparently cannot force souls to board and instead will frequently visit a reluctant soul to convince them otherwise. He will give hints to the Traveler so that they can assist him in persuading the souls of Tsurumi islanders to let go of their attachment to life and accept leaving the island.

Appearance[]
To the Traveler, the "Boatman" appears just like any other spirits, floating light blue translucent figure with a glowing white core. However, other souls on Tsurumi Island see him as a man dressed in a golden outfit and possessing a splendid silver boat. Una specifically describes him wearing golden fur clothes, long gold pants, with a crown of gold silk on his head.[2]

Trivia[]
"Boatman" may be a reference to Charon of Greek mythology, as both are individuals who escort the souls of the dead to the afterlife by use of a boat.
