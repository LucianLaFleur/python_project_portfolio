Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing In the Wake of Narcissus


Topyas: Ah, hello. I've been continuing to practice the Melody of Vesta recently...
 Have you played it for Mamere?
Topyas: N—Not yet, I'm afraid. I mean, she's often out of the village, and no one can find her when that happens.
Topyas: But when she's around, I also feel kinda... embarrassed... This song's supposed to be a gift, after all. I have to practice a few more times...
Topyas: But I'll find a chance to play for her. I'm sure of it!
 I've got something else to attend to the moment...
Topyas: Alright. Go do what you have to first.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing In the Wake of Narcissus


Topyas: Ah, hello. I've been continuing to practice the Melody of Vesta recently...
 About the song to be played for Mamere...
Topyas: Oh! I finally played it for her as a farewell gift when she left the village to travel!
Topyas: She said she could see tall towers and gorgeous ships as it played in her ear...
Topyas: And she even mentioned the probability of creating a masterpiece based on it! She never ceases to impress!
Topyas: Anyway, I owe you my thanks! I couldn't have made such a precious memory without your help!
 I've got something else to attend to the moment...
Topyas: Alright. Go do what you have to first.
