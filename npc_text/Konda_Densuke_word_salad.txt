Dialogue[]

Konda Densuke: I haven't seen an unfamiliar face in the village for quite sometime. Such energy and liveliness! Ah, it really is great to be young...
Konda Densuke: Are you looking for me? Have you run into any difficulties?
 Tell me a bit about yourself, sir.
Konda Densuke: My name is Konda Densuke, and I'm the village head here. I welcome you on behalf of everyone here.
Konda Densuke: Though we are a small village, our history runs even further than Ritou Harbor. A long, long, long time ago, the Almighty Shogun granted my ancestors this land.
Konda Densuke: From that moment onward, this village was named Konda Village and has been managed by my family ever since.
 What can you tell me about Konda Village?
Konda Densuke: You see those Lavender Melons in the fields? That's our proud local specialty.
Konda Densuke: Is it good? Oh my, is it delicious! It is filled with useful materials from top to bottom. Merchants and dyehouses love these melons. Not only can you cook with it, the flowers can also be used to make natural and durable dye. It can even act as pest repellent!
Konda Densuke: Oh, our village used to be so lively. Merchants looking for dye, adventurers heading to Inazuma from Ritou, outlanders touring the land... This place used be filled with people from everywhere, and I used to show them around and give them directions.
Konda Densuke: Too bad all that's in the past now. Ever since the Sakoku Decree came into force, it became difficult for outlanders to make their way here. Merchandise became hard to sell and dyehouses no longer needed that much dye. As a result, the fields have all gone to waste...
Konda Densuke: What a shame. This historical village and its fertile land... it's all gone to waste! *sigh*
(After completing Transient Dreams)

Konda Densuke: Say, now that the Sakoku Decree has been abolished, do you think there's any chance that we can revive our village's fortunes by returning to our old industry?
 So, about the treasure at the bottom of the well... (Unlocked after completing A Strange Story in Konda)
Konda Densuke: At first, it was the doing of those drunken teenagers.
Konda Densuke: But no one expected that their memories of the incident would suddenly disappear once they sobered up. The investigators couldn't find any signs of them lying and hastily closed the case.
Konda Densuke: Afterwards, I said what needed to be said and yelled at whoever needed yelling at. I believe they're aware of the severity of their mistake.
Konda Densuke: *sigh* However... there are some things that should be kept within the village... It's not that it would embarrass me, it's just that with the village being in this state, and with me growing old and useless...
Konda Densuke: I can't let the remaining seniors and youngsters take the blame for covering something up. I can't let them shoulder that bad name...
 Goodbye.
Konda Densuke: Off you go, then. Work hard while you're still young!
