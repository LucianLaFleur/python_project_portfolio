Profile[]
Hanachirusato was a shrine maiden that described herself as condensed "filth" originating from inherited memories of the late Kitsune Saiguu. Unable to completely disperse, they manifested into the earth and rotted.
Her purpose while present in Inazuma included carefully watching over Narukami Island and purifying these festering evocations through the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual.[1] After Hanachirusato completed her aforementioned tasks alongside the Traveler, she solemnly dematerialized and left behind her mask; a forging blueprint for the Hakushin Ring.
She also referred to the Traveler as the "Destined One", eventually entrusting them with the Memento Lens during her quest.

Appearance[]
Hanachirusato had brown, bobbed hair and wore a white, smiling fox mask on her face. She was dressed in a white kosode with a pair of bright red hakama, the traditional attire of shrine maidens. Her footwear consisted of a pair of white tabi socks and okobo (Japanese wooden sandals) with red straps.

Trivia[]
Her name in Japanese 花散里 is also the name of a character in the Japanese classic The Tale of Genji (Japanese: 源氏物語 Genji Monogatari).[2]
Previously, her name was "Kazari" (a different reading of the same characters), but it was changed in Version 2.7 to match the reading in The Tale of Genji.
The kanji characters of her name means "Village Where Blossoms Fall." In the case of the particular poem of The Tale of Genji, which the name of the female character Hanachirusato was derived from, they are the blossoms of a kind of orange (Citrus tachibana). However, since hana ("blossom") often refers to sakura blossoms in poetic contexts,[3] her name can also specifically mean "Village Where Sakura Blossoms Fall," which is more fitting for the lore of the game.
She shares her name with the soundtrack "Hanachirusato."
