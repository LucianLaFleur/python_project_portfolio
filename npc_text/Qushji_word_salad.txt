Media:VO Qushji All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Qushji: (I just want to lay on my back and stargaze.)

Dialogue[]

Qushji: I guess my neck is going to snap before I even solve this.
 Are you alright?
Qushji: My neck... It hurts...
Qushji: This is probably the ordeal all astrologers must go through. The weight of the starry sky seems to crash down on the neck when you stargaze.
Qushji: Worse yet, the hydromantic instruments in the academy fell into disrepair due to budget constraint.
Qushji: Researchers like us who aren't part of big projects must resort to more primitive measures...
Qushji: If only the new Grand Conservator knew the value of astrology...
 Take care.
Qushji: Thanks for your concern.
Qushji: The only consolation is that now that the Akademiya has started to work on a much more important project, they have lowered their expectations on our research productivity.
Qushji: I'll also have more time to take better care of myself now.
Qushji: Neck pain may be difficult to cure, but a healthy diet is said to be able to improve one's vision. Well, there are worse things to suffer through for a good cause...
(Obtain  Carrot ×10)
 The new Grand Conservator?
Qushji: Yes... A youngster like you should be better informed than me.
Qushji: Everyone in Sumeru City is paying close attention to the matter, be it an ordinary researcher like myself or a barber in the downtown area.
Qushji: If the new Grand Conservator is interested in astrology, he might apply for some funding and restart the use of those hydromantic instruments.
Qushji: I can also benefit from his influence and no longer have to stick out my old neck again.
Qushji: So that means... I'd prefer to have Rifaet be the next Grand Conservator.
 See you.
Qushji: Farewell. I'll have a break.
