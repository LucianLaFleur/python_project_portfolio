Ruijin is a young woman with short black twintails and side swept bangs as well as brown eyes. She wears a sleeveless cheongsam-inspired crop top consisting of light brown and black, a pair of separate puffed sleeves of the same colors along with fingerless black gloves and puffed, dark brown shorts with an equally dark belt. Both her shorts and sleeves have jagged lines as a motive on them. She also wears dark brown boots with heels that reach to her shins and dark stockings that go up to just beneath her knees.

Dialogue[]

Ruijin: Hello! Would you like to give Theater Mechanicus a go? It's loads of fun!
 I'll play a round.

 What's Theater Mechanicus?
Ruijin: Theater Mechanicus is new kind of board game that I just invented.
Ruijin: All you need to play is a table a few game pieces, and a game master.
Ruijin: The objective of the game is to use various strategies to withstand the monster attacks. At least, that's the main idea for now...
Ruijin: But who knows, if any more good ideas come to me, I'd like to expand the game's content even more.
Ruijin: It'd be great to add things like exploring ruins, or solving evil plots... If all goes well, the game could potentially become like a true adventure in another world.
 How much does it cost to play?
Ruijin: Well, I've only just finished designing this board game and would like to hear what people think of such a game.
Ruijin: So during the Lantern Rite, it won't cost anyone a single Mora to play. All you need is Xiao Lantern and you can play one round.
Ruijin: If you'd like to give it a try, just let me know.
 Goodbye.
Ruijin: Farewell. If you'd like to give Theater Mechanicus a go, just let me know.

Descriptions[]
A young lady who is running a game she calls "Theater Mechanicus" during the Lantern Rite. She has just invented the game, which is played with just a table, a few chess pawns, and a host. Because the game is still relatively unknown, and Ruijin would like to get more feedback from players, there is a special Lantern Rite discount: a match costs only one Xiao Lantern. Reportedly, in order to popularize "Theater Mechanicus" across other parts of Teyvat, she has come up with an ambitious update schedule with a new version of the game being released every six weeks, which seems quite challenging for one person to handle.Theater Mechanicus Map Icon
