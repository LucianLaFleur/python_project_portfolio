Dialogue[]

Ruying: *yawn*
Ruying: If only I had come a few days earlier...
 Didn't sleep well?
Ruying: Ah, yes.
Ruying: This inn is great. The owner is friendly, and the service is good. We foreign merchants like staying here.
Ruying: But there is one problem: the noise insulation is bad.
Ruying: I could hear the buzz of conversation next door while lying in bed at night.
Ruying: And I don't know if the man and woman next door were speaking in a dialect or something... I could understand the words but not the meaning.
 A few days earlier?
Ruying: Yup.
Ruying: The inn owner said that the person who was my neighbor was a researcher or something, and wrote papers all day.
Ruying: Too bad it seems like he disappeared a few days ago, and the room's been let out. The people who moved in are a couple who can't stop yapping.
Ruying: If I'd arrived a few days ago, I'd be done with my business and on my way, instead of being bothered by the noise all night and unable to sleep...
 Rest well.
Ruying: Oh, thanks.
