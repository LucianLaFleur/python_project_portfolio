  Quest-Exclusive NPCs 




The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou" is a quest-exclusive NPC in Inazuma. He first appears in the World Quest Series From Dusk to Dawn in Byakuyakoku as Enjou.
He is the Traveler's translator and sole clerical staff for the duration of Enkanomiya's trial. He is later revealed to be a Pyro-aligned Abyss Lector in search of the book Before Sun and Moon in order to prove that the gods and Celestia were from beyond Teyvat.

Profile[]
Enjou claims to be a researcher whose duty is to organize and translate clues regarding Enkanomiya's trial to obtain the Bloodbranch Coral. Throughout the duration of the trial, Enjou helps the Traveler in a multitude of different ways, such as informing them of the Golden Bridle's location and breaking the seal that would otherwise render Dainichi Mikoshi unenterable.
After the Traveler defeats the three Bathysmal Vishaps under the Dainichi Mikoshi, Enjou reveals that he is a colluding member of the Abyss Order and transforms to his original form. He is ultimately bested and casually suggests that Paimon might betray them before teleporting to the Abyss.
During Three Realms Gateway Offering event, Enjou returned to Enkanomiya and restored the three Towers of the Void with Abyssal technology, causing the darkness to encroach the land and harming everything that wasn't related to the Abyss. The Traveler, who had been sent by Sangonomiya Kokomi, agrees to work with Tsumi to help with their investigation after the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri only halted the bleached Holy Soil instead of reversing it. 
After restoring the Towers of the Void to emit energy from the Light Realm, Tsumi sensed that a faint vortex is still continuously absorbing the darkness inside the Dainichi Mikoshi and believes it is triggered by Enjou's need for Abyssal energy. She reveals the location of Enjou and the Traveler confronted him in the library, where he revealed that Tsumi was one of the vishap-people and she is using the Traveler to get her revenge on him. He formed an alliance with the vishaps after promising to plunge Enkanomiya into darkness so that the vishaps could rescue their captive kin in the Dainichi Mikoshi, in return for them allowing Abyss Order safe passage through the vishap's territory. However, the vishaps did not know that the void energies were poisonous to them and thus believed he had betrayed them, although he claimed that it would have been pointless if they were subjected to the powers of the Abyss but remained unaffected. He told the Traveler how to restore the light before the vishaps could cut off the Bloodbranch Coral source, which would doom Watatsumi Island and gave them part of a pendant that he had found while inside the Dainichi Mikoshi before teleporting back to the Abyss.

Trivia[]
The kanji for Enjou's name, 淵上, does indeed mean "above the depth" as he explained to the Traveler during his first meeting. However, his name is also a homophone of  (Japanese: 炎上 "flaming"), hinting at his true identity.
His kanji can be also read as Fuchigami (or Fuchikami) by using the native reading, in which case it represents a Japanese surname. It may show his attempt to pretend to be an Inazuman.
Enjou's true identity is hinted several times in-game:
When dispelling the seal enclosing the Dainichi Mikoshi, he tells them to stay back in case something bad happened, such as getting "cursed and turn into some sort of flame-flinging monster".
After dispelling the seal, he then remarks about a "kind of rush you get from burning a huge library"; it is not known if this was a library either in Sumeru or if he was referring to the events of the "Great Fire of Fall Equinox", the latter being the largest library in northern Teyvat prior to its burning.
