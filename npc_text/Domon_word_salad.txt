Profile[]
Domon is the present-day master of the Meikyou Shisui Art, with the goal to become the best swordmaster in the world. He has two current known disciples, Junya and Nanako, who care for him very deeply.
When he was younger, he studied Meikyou Shisui Arts, but was scolded at the time by their sensei for his aspiration to be the best. He studied the arts with his good friend and senior Anzai. Later on, Domon dueled both Anzai and their sensei, defeating both of them. Anzai left out of shame and embarrassment, while their sensei, well advanced in his years, died shortly after the duel. At some point in his travels, Domon saved Nanako from a group of pirates, but was unable to save her parents. He later settled down in Inazuma City and set up a dojo for the arts, becoming well known throughout Inazuma for his swordsmanship.
Domon has since had his Vision taken away due to the Vision Hunt Decree, in turn losing his ambition to be the best in the world. This caused him to fall into a state of deep regret and anxiety of the pain he brought to others. Eventually, this lead him to lose his mind and hallucinate everyone he had previously beat in a duel surrounding him, including Anzai and his old sensei.
After reconciling with Anzai, he is now focused on passing everything he has learnt onto his disciples, including his old ambition. His Vision was soon returned to him following the abolishment of the Vision Hunt Decree, although he still retains his humbleness and continues to pass down his aspirations to his disciples.

Appearance[]

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing A Swordmaster's Path Is Paved With Broken Blades)
Domon: Was I like this before... Why did I want to wield my sword...
Domon: Master... Senior... I...
Domon: Alright! If you want to get your revenge, go on, then! Ahahaha...
 Who are you?
Domon: What is the ultimate swordsmanship... Will defeating everyone make you the best in the world?
Domon: But the best in the world... if I am the best in the world...
Domon: If I am the best in the world, why am I so obsessed with the past?
Domon: And if I am not the best in the world, then master and the others have... for nothing...
 Are you alright...?
Domon: Alright... alright? I'd be alright if I had good sword skills...
Domon: But my Vision...
Domon: Without my Vision, I can no longer be the best in the world... All the things I did in the past would all... even my disciples will...
Domon: Master, Senior... don't just stand there and watch, say something, please...!
 Goodbye...
Domon: What on earth was I thinking back then...

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After completing A Swordmaster's Path Is Paved With Broken Blades)
Domon: Hello, if you want to become a disciple here, please... Ah, it's you, the Traveler.
Domon: It has been a while. How has your journey through Inazuma gone?
 May your wishes be granted as soon as possible.
(After completing Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow)‍[Unlock condition]
Domon: Haha, thank you.
Domon: I've written down some of my experiences in swordsmanship that I've gleaned over the years. Though you aren't one of my disciples, I'm still indebted to you. Please accept it.
Domon: I wish you good fortunes in the long journey ahead of you.
(Obtain  Hero's Wit ×2)
 You look a lot better now.
(Before completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
Domon: Haha, once the knot in my heart came loose, I knew what to do next.
Domon: Although I have lost my Vision and have no way of making my dream come true... I still have a group of disciples to succeed my will. The Meikyou Shisui Art will never be forgotten. There is still hope for our dream of being the best in the world.
 You look much better now.
(After completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
Domon: Haha, once the knot in my heart came loose, I knew what to do next.
Domon: Although my Vision has returned, I am not the person I was before... I will leave the dream of being the greatest swordmaster to my disciples.
Domon: As long as these young hopefuls are around, the Meikyou Shisui Art will never become lost to time.
 Goodbye.
Domon: Thank you! Goodbye.

Trivia[]
Iwakura Mitsunari mentions him if you talk to him after defeating the other Iwakura Art disciples, wondering if Domon taught the Traveler their swordsmanship style.
Considering his name and his Meikyou Shisui Art, he was motivated from Domon Kasshu who is main character of Mobile Fighter G Gundam.
