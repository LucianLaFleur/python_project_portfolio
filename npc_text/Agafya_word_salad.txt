Profile[]
Agafya is a Mirror Maiden who traveled to the Golden Apple Archipelago alongside her comrades to accompany Persikov, who had sought an island to test his machine after a higher-ranking Fatui disagreed with him. She accompanied Zakhar to Broken Isle to complete their task. Zakhar soon had a stomachache, so Agafya sent him away to a cave to rest while she completed the task herself. During the process, she was set upon by hilichurls but managed to survive.
Due to the machine having broken down, Agafya soon became trapped in her mind as with all the other Fatui, most notably looking for a pocket watch containing a photo of her and her brothers. The Traveler and Paimon found her while exploring the isle. After fixing Persikov's machine and finding the pocket watch, they showed it to her, restoring her mind. However, she was alarmed to have been saved by the two, having learned of them from internal files and expected to be taken advantage of. The Traveler placated her fears by accepting some unrelated intelligence and they soon freed Zakhar. She then returned to the camp on the central island.
There, she reunited with her other comrades Chevka and Yakov, where they worked with the Traveler to restore Yakov's mind. Once Yakov was restored, the four left the camp, leaving behind a note. In it, she wrote that she hoped the method she taught them to acquire intelligence would be useful, remarking that it was the only useful thing she said at all.

Appearance[]
Agafya takes on the appearance of a Fatui Mirror Maiden. She is approximately two-thirds of the height of enemy Mirror Maidens.
