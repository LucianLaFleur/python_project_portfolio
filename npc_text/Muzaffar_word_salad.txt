Story[]
Muzaffar was one of the Twenty-Nine Deys of Orghana (the city now known as Port Ormos). 
King Saleb Dowleh, originally known as Goudarz, was somehow involved with Tulaytullah before his rise as king, although he later left the city to take up residence in Gurabad. Saleb Dowleh made an alliance with the port city of Orghana,[1] although Muzaffar would later turn his back on both sides, killing Saleb Dowleh and his entire bloodline and deciding to permanently reside in the desert instead of returning to Orghana.[2] His conquest of the Great Red Sand was full of pillaging and bloodshed. According to a Primal Obelisk "...He took the famed city Beit Raha and tore down its walls and towers... presented the head of Nasrul, the master of the city, before his brothers and comrades. They made mockery of it, and their joy was equal in greatness to its stench."[3]
His son Zumurud became known as the Verdant Lord.
