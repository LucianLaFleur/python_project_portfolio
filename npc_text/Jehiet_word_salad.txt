Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Woodland Encounter.


Jehiet: Oh, are you a guest from afar...?
Jehiet: If so, you should rest for a good while in Vimara Village. It is much more comfortable here than in the desert...
 About the desert environment...
Jehiet: The temperature difference between day and night in the desert is frightening. The wind howls and the sun burns...
Jehiet: I didn't care about that when I was young. But now, I prefer places that are warm and humid...
 Goodbye...
Jehiet: Goodbye. I hope you enjoy the peace and quiet here.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Unlocked after completing Woodland Encounter.


Jehiet: The Vimara Village's environment is much better than that in the desert. Have some good rest, little guest...
 About the desert environment...
Jehiet: The temperature difference between day and night in the desert is frightening. The wind howls and the sun burns...
Jehiet: I didn't care about that when I was young. But now, I prefer places that are warm and humid...
 About Iotham...
Jehiet: Iotham... There was a foreign couple in Vimara Village once, and they left Iotham behind when they left.
Jehiet: We didn't know what to do...
Jehiet: At that time, I felt terrible for the little child. If they didn't want to raise him, I would!
Jehiet: It was just one more mouth to feed. How could I watch him starve?
Jehiet: Iotham is a good boy who's sensible and holds respect for the elders. Now my biggest wish is that he can grow up happy and healthy.
 I'm sure Iotham will grow up, healthy and strong.
Jehiet: Thank you, little guest. Iotham has told me so much about you. He admires you a lot!
Jehiet: You're still young with much room for growth. Keep a healthy diet, and you can be stronger. Now, these are for you.
Jehiet: Come back to Vimara Village if you ever feel tired or need a break. Iotham will be happy to see you.
(Obtain  Delicious Curry Shrimp ×3)
 Goodbye...
Jehiet: Goodbye. I hope you'll enjoy the peaceful lifestyle here, dear guest.
