Profile[]
Grandmaster Hanakado is deeply passionate about beetle-fighting. Much like Arataki Itto, he has an extravagant and unique way of speaking, giving Paimon the impression that he was born to be Itto's arch-nemesis.[3] Despite his pride and confidence in his beetle-fighting abilities, Hanakado is still willing to embrace and learn from a worthy opponent.[4]
Before the first iteration of the Arataki Beetle Brawl, Kuki Shinobu ran into Hanakado, who was eager to meet Itto so he could beetle battle him. During the first iteration of the Beetle Brawl, Hanakado sent his fellow beetle battlers to challenge Itto, though each one was defeated by Paimon and Crimson Staff. Hanakado eventually challenges them and is likewise defeated, resulting in him joining the Arataki Gang.
Hanakado would eventually accompany Itto and Shinobu to Liyue to further promote beetle battling. After getting a permit with Yanfei's assistance, the tournament soon proves to be a success. Hanakado decides to stay in Liyue to continue learning from Guoba and the adepti, scout for more talent and optimizing the beetles' diets. He hosts a contest sometime during Lantern Rite, which is implied to be successful. Having to get back home before their money runs out, Itto and Shinobu leave Hanakado to oversee the contest and for Itto to keep Hanakado's grandfather informed.
After Lantern Rite had ended for the year, Itto found some work as a sailor and the ship docked in Liyue, allowing Itto to hang out with Hanakado during his free time off the ship. Itto claimed it was more of a fortunate coincidence, but Shinobu indicated that seeing Hanakado was the main reason for Itto applying for the job in the first place.[5]

Appearance[]
Grandmaster Hanakado is a young boy with maroon colored hair and dark gray eyes. He wears a striped blue shirt with darker blue shorts and a pointed straw hat.
