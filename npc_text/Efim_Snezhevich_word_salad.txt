Profile[]
Efim is a Snezhevich,[Note 1] an orphan raised by the Fatui, and Lyudochka Snezhevna's superior. He grew up in the House of the Hearth, and was an instructor there during Crucabena's tenure as the House's head. After the current Arlecchino killed Crucabena and became the new head, Efim broke off from the House with some unsuspecting subordinates and continued pursuing the old Knave's directives, pretending to be following the new Knave to control his subordinates. His true goals and loyalty are unknown.[1]
After a ceasefire was announced between the Inazuma Shogunate and Watatsumi Army, Efim and his subordinates arrived in Inazuma to restart the war by "poisoning" Watatsumi Island by posing as Shogunate personnel. He claimed to Lyudochka that he hoped that this would improve Arlecchino's prestige following Signora's death.
He sent Lyudochka to the Grand Narukami Shrine and three others across Ritou and Inazuma City. Lyudochka began to enjoy life in Inazuma and started stalling her assignments, which he was made aware of after Tae informed him of her discovery of a light novel in Lyudochka's purse. Efim snapped at this as he was well aware of her intentional stalling and gave her his "Final Instructions" before leaving, unaware that they were being listened in on by the Traveler. The Traveler defeated Lyudochka, who expressed remorse and opposed the plan. As her life was in danger by Efim as long as she was alive, the Traveler asked Momoyo to make a fake body double and put Lyudochka's clothes on them. Momoyo let herself get captured by the Fatui and Lyudochka's "corpse" was discovered, which Efim verified as hers from the clothing. Annoyed that his critical piece was gone, he tasked his subordinates to interrogate Momoyo and continue the operation as planned before being recalled to Snezhnaya, unaware that the Shuumatsuban were fully aware of his plans.
