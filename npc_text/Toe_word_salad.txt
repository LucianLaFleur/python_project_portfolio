Profile[]
Toe is a dockworker willing to be hired for work for the Rite of Parting.
While willing to negotiate his hiring rate, he will get angry if the Traveler continuously lowballs an offer. He will also initially refuse to go pick up his payment from Childe himself, citing that it's not worth it without a detour fee. After receiving the fee, he will guarantee the work to be done before picking up payment.
