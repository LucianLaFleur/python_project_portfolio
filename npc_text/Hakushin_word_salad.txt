Profile[]
Hakushin was the matriarch and namesake of the Hakushin Clan, a prominent kitsune clan in Inazuma that dwelt around Mt. Yougou. The Grand Narukami Shrine is implied to have already existed during Hakushin's lifetime, and she managed the shrine along with her apprentices. She had six apprentices, the eldest of which was Black Fox Itaru.[1]

Trivia[]
Hakushin is referenced in the title of the soundtrack "Hakushin's Lullaby."
She is most likely inspired by the Buddhist goddess Dakini and her Shinto manifestation Inari, a deity of agricultural fertility, whose divine messengers are foxes. Originated as a minor spirit from the demonic clan ḍākinī in the ancient Indian mythology, Dakini gradually gained prominence in Mahayana Buddhism. Finally, under the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism, she became equated with Inari, one of the most famed deities in Japan.
In the canonical beliefs of Shinto, foxes are merely the messengers of Inari, they are not involved with Inari beyond that. In folk legends, however, Inari is commonly considered to be a fox goddess, and her messengers byakko ("white foxes") are also casually called o-inari-sama (polite form of inari).
Etymology[]
One of Dakini's sacred titles in Japanese is Byakushin Ko'ou Bosatsu (Japanese: 白晨狐王菩薩 "White-Dawn Fox-Queen Bodhisattva").[2] The first two characters are sometimes written as 白辰, which is the name for Genshin's Hakushin, and Hakushin is the kan-on reading for both 白晨 and 白辰.

↑ Japanese: The character 辰 typically means "dragon" (in the Chinese zodiac) or "celestial body." However, in this case, it is used as an alternative form of 晨 "dawn" or "morning." See the Etymology section.
