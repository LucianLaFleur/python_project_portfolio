Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing Masquerade of the Guilty)
Herbier: No two cases are alike. The details guide the story.
 And how would you differentiate them?
Herbier: Well, we'd need to analyze each case in detail, but I do have a personal "prescription."
Herbier: If Lady Furina comes personally and looks excited, then the case itself might not be important, but there must be something incredible about it all the same.
Herbier: ...Though even if there is no such thing, she will whip up drama of her own accord.
Herbier: And if the Chief Justice personally presides over the trial, then it's almost certainly worth paying attention — it will certainly be more newsworthy, that's for sure.
Herbier: But such cases aren't very easy to report on. In fact, some of them involve information blackouts.
 I'll leave you to it, then.
Herbier: See you.

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After completing Masquerade of the Guilty)
Herbier: No two cases are alike. The details guide the story.
 And how would you differentiate them?
Herbier: Well, we'd need to analyze each case in detail, but I've always had a personal "prescription."
Herbier: If Lady Furina comes personally and looks excited, then there will be something incredible about the case, even if it isn't an important one.
Herbier: ...Even if there's nothing special about the case, Lady Furina can create drama herself.
Herbier: And if the Chief Justice personally presides over the trial, it'll most likely be worth paying attention to. Certainly more newsworthy, at any rate.
Herbier: But such cases aren't very easy to report on. In fact, some of them involve information blackouts.
Herbier: But now... it seems like only half the "prescription" is applicable.
 I'll leave you to it, then.
Herbier: See you.
