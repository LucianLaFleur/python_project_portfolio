Dialogue[]

(Before completing Ahoy! A Pirate's Growth for Ye!)
Little Lulu: Ten thousand waves, it's time to set sail!
Little Meng: Arrr! The waves be gettin' bigger! Whoa! My booty and plunder is goin' to go overboard! Strap 'er down, maties!
Little Lulu: Matey! Matey! All hands on deck! Or else... or else I'll... I'll make ye walk the plank!
Little Fei: ...
Little Lulu: Matey!
Little Fei: ...I don't wanna play anymore. I'm always your "matey..."
Little Lulu: So what do you wanna be?
Little Fei: ...I wanna be Captain Beidou...
Little Fei: Captain Beidou's so cool, but it's always Lulu that gets to be her!
Little Lulu: That's 'cause I'm a girl and I'm the oldest!
Little Fei: But, but I'm the tallest! Boy, girl, it's all the same when you close your eyes anyway!
Little Meng: It's not the same! You don't have the same... feeling!
Little Fei: *cries*
Little Meng: Oh, now you've done it! Fei is crying again...
Little Lulu: Okay, okay... I'll let you have a turn being Beidou, okay?
(After completing Ahoy! A Pirate's Growth for Ye!)
Little Fei: Why has Little Meng decided to go to Sumeru?
Little Lulu: Maybe he just wants to have a look around.
Little Fei: Really? That's so cool... I wanna go out and play as well...

Notes[]

↑ After finishing the first quest in that series, Little Lulu and Little Fei immediately change location and talk about Little Meng's decision to go to Sumeru, and Little Meng is not present but can still appear for Pirate Invasion, in Liyue Harbor!. However, Little Meng does not decide to go to Sumeru until the third quest in that series, when it is decided for him. He spends the next three commissions in that series still in Liyue, preparing for the trip.
