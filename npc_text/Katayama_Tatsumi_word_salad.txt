Story[]
Little is known about Tatsumi's life or history beyond the fact that he was part of the Iwakura Clan while Iwakura Mitsunari was its clan head. According to Mitsunari, he always had a knack for naming his battles, reasoning that if he became famous, his battles would be more legendary. When the Vision Hunt Decree was enacted, Mitsunari had his Vision taken and decided to join the Shogunate forces.[1] Many of the other clan members saw this as a betrayal of their clan's pursuit of righteousness and deserted him, choosing to go rogue or oppose the Shogunate. Tatsumi appears to have chosen the former path.
The Traveler encounters Tatsumi in Serpent's Head, where he immediately pulls them into a duel and is slain for the trouble. After receiving word that a Traveler has been going around killing Iwakura Clan members, two expelled members, Okazaki Toraemon and Yanagiha Arashi, find his corpse and collect his sword to create a memorial.[2][3]
