Dialogue[]

During Spices From the West
Nazafarin: Ah, by Lesser Lord Kusanali, the weight on my shoulders has truly been lifted!
Nazafarin: Most good hearts do the two of you possess!
 You know, your manner of speech is kinda...
Nazafarin: Ah, "dear Lesser Lord Kusanali"! You mean how I tend to say things like that? Well, you see, I have a friend from Fontaine who enjoys talking like that.
Nazafarin: After spending too much time talking to him, I, too, began to speak in that fashion.
Nazafarin: I would even say that I'm comparatively restrained... I just can't help myself at times. Blessed Kusanali, I'll do what I can, though.
 So, how do I use this pot of yours?
Nazafarin: Ah, yes, sorry. I would've forgotten if you hadn't reminded me, I'll wager.
Nazafarin: It's actually quite simple. You simply need to add the correct seasonings at the right time.
Nazafarin: I'm sure you'll figure it out in just a couple of tries.
 See you.
Nazafarin: See you! Thank you once again, Nazafarin's saviors!
During Spices From the West: Northerly Search
Nazafarin: Ah, Lesser Lord Kusanali be praised! My thanks to you two, many thanks indeed!
 Could you remind me how to use this pot again?
Nazafarin: Right, yes, of course. A great hero such as yourself is rather busy, after all, perhaps too busy to remember such things. I did not consider that.
Nazafarin: It's actually quite simple. You simply need to add the correct seasonings at the right time.
Nazafarin: I'm sure you'll work it out once you try it.
 See you.
Nazafarin: See you. Once again, you have Nazafarin's utmost thanks! May this go smoothly for you.
