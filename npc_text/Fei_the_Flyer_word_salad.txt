Profile[]
Fei joined The Crux Clash for the Masterless Vision, knowing that it would be a wealthy commodity to sell on the black market. Due to his ties with the Treasure Hoarders, Fei was more skilled in martial arts than most of the competitors, taking advantage of his speed to overcome more powerful opponents. During the tournament, he bested Uncle Yun, but after seeing Rongshi lose to the Traveler, realized that he was outmatched and stole the Vision. However, he was pursued by them and Kazuha and forced to give the Vision up in return for not being apprehended.

Appearance[]
Fei wears the Treasure Hoarders outfit that the Pyro Potioneer dons. His hair color is also the same as them, albeit a different hairstyle.
