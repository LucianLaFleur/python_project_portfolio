 Please take a seat...
Media:VO Quezhi 01.ogg "Please take a seat and enjoy a nice meal."

Dialogue[]

Quezhi: Please follow me, we have seats over here. Would you like to enjoy some tea while listening to the performance, or would you prefer a work meal?
 What kinds of tea are there?
Quezhi: Our teahouse proudly offers both the Single-Origin Yauwan Tea and Sunglo Tea that Chenyu Vale is renowned for, in every available grade!
Quezhi: We also have the Tianheng Bohea, Yunlai White Tea, and Bishui Green Tea, which are popular in Liyue Harbor, all at export quality!
 Work meal?
Quezhi: Oh, forgive me. According to Ms. Vert Jr.'s suggestion, a more elegant name for it would be... a simple meal.
Quezhi: Indeed! It's a simple meal for those coming and going on business!
Quezhi: Of course, we serve regular lunch and dinner as well. However, we usually don't serve them in our outdoor dining area.
Quezhi: These tables are usually reserved for guests to sip tea while listening to performances and stories.
Quezhi: Our teahouse's indoor dining area, private seats, and private rooms are temporarily under renovation. Please do give us a visit once those renovations are completed!
 I'm just looking around, you do you.
Quezhi: I look forward to serving you again!
