Dialogue[]
Invitation of Windblume[]

Plauen: Give it a go! This is the special festive event that the Adventurers' Guild has prepared for everyone.
 What's in this domain?
Plauen: This is a special domain that was discovered by the Adventurers' Guild some time ago. It seems to only turn up at specific times.
Plauen: There are quite a few interesting things going on inside. We've opened it to the public after some modification work.
Plauen: If you're interested, please feel free to attempt this challenge. Do it alone, or call your friends, either is fine!
 It's not dangerous in there, is it?
Plauen: Don't worry, we'll have seasoned adventurers accompanying you all the way if you bring people without any experience.
Plauen: But I think that a veteran such as you will be fine.
 Do you know about any of the other activities?
Plauen: Hmm, for this, you can go look for Lizzie. She's always introducing fun events to people during the Windblume Festival.
Plauen: I hope that you'll enjoy yourself, too!
 See you around!
Plauen: See you. Come back and challenge this domain again if you have the time.

Windblume's Breath[]

(Before the event started)
Plauen: Is this game really that romantic? I don't feel it at all...
Plauen: Or maybe I just utterly lack artistic talent... or something...
(During the event)
Plauen: What do you think? Care to have a game of Floral Chess?
 I'll give it a go.
 Tell me a bit more about Floral Chess.
Plauen: The adventurer who designed this game said that his inspiration came from the billowing petals and the wind that pursues them...
Plauen: And the game is meant to imitate the... romanticism of pursuing these flower petals...
Plauen: From a player's perspective, though, I'd say it's more like being chased around by some balloons with flower petals and paper strips stuffed in them...
Plauen: The experience isn't bad, don't get me wrong, but where's the romanticism...?
 See you around.
Plauen: Yeah, see you. If you wanna give this a try, just come over and give me a shout.
