Dialogue[]

Tavernier: Maybe I should pick another place...
 Pick another place?
Tavernier: I mean somewhere else to do business.
Tavernier: I'm a merchant from Fontaine. I focus on fine clockwork machinery and luxury goods.
Tavernier: I stayed in Mondstadt for a while, but it's too laid-back for me.
Tavernier: I thought Sumeru as a country of wisdom would boast laws and orders as strict as Fontaine. I never expected such a lax and unsophisticated atmosphere here!
Tavernier: The only thing not so lax is the trade supervisors who are always making trouble for me.
Tavernier: I'm just selling stuff from Fontaine, why do they keep questioning me?
Tavernier: They wouldn't be so naive to expect me to spill my business secrets, would they?
 See you.
Tavernier: Farewell. I wonder if Snezhnaya would be better...
