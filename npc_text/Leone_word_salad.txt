Dialogue[]

Leone: Welcome! The weather's rather fine today, isn't it? Is there anything I can help you with?
 Hello there.
Leone: Welcome, welcome. This is Hotel Debord, a stage for fine food and fine art both.
Leone: May you enjoy delicious food and exciting performances both here today.
 Tell me about the performances...
Leone: If I had to recommend something, it would be the magic show by the Great Magician Lyney and Lynette.
Leone: Their magic is truly a thing of surpassing beauty, and they also have many unexpected ideas!
Leone: That said, their performance times are as unpredictable as their magic tricks.
Leone: You would be very fortunate to meet them indeed.
 See you.
Leone: Take care.
