 Headlines these days...
Media:VO Hubel 01.ogg "Ah... So these are the kind of headlines they're going for these days..."

Dialogue[]

Hubel: Welcome, welcome to this fair ocean of words!
 I'll have a look, no problem.
Hubel: Take your time. Personally, I'd recommend a thriller!
 And you are...?
Hubel: You can call me the... temporary owner of this little establishment.
Hubel: I say "temporary," for it is my dream to join The Steambird!
Hubel: I work hard every day, honing my scripts and accumulating rhetoric to constantly improve my understanding of the art of language!
Hubel: One day, I'll report all I've seen, and my astounding literary skills will spill across the headlines!
 See you.
Hubel: We refresh our lineup often, so come back again soon!
