Dialogue[]

Harrison: Shush! Are you here to "stock up"?
Harrison: Keep your voice down, and I can show you some real goodies...
 Goodies...?
Harrison: Exactly! The goods at International Groceries are premium products imported from merchants all over the world. We've got them in all types and categories. I'm sure you'll like one of them.
 You sure you're not smug...
Harrison: Shh! The walls have ears, friend!
Harrison: These are imported goods! I've never heard of this smuggling nonsense, haha!
Harrison: I see that you're an outlander as well. You understand what we're about, right?
Harrison: If you need anything, remember to help a brother out.
 This...
Harrison: *sigh*... Sincerity is a key part of doing business, is it not? Just treat it as a gift from a friend.
Harrison: Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? I'll be seeing you around!

 Goodbye...
Harrison: Goodbye! Check with me first if you ever need anything.
