Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Omnipresence Over Mortals.


Yokoyama: Do you need something, outlander?
 What is this place?
Yokoyama: This is a key site of the Kanjou Commission, not a place an outlander such as yourself should visit.
Yokoyama: If you wish to seek an audience with the Kanjou Commissioner, then you should go to the Outlander Affairs Agency and hand in your letter and name card.
Yokoyama: As for whether you can see the Commissioner... I'd say it's up to luck.
 Goodbye...
Yokoyama: Hmph... Whatever.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Omnipresence Over Mortals.


Yokoyama: Hi, can I help you?
 What is this place?
Yokoyama: This is a key site of the Kanjou Commission, the center of management for all of Ritou.
Yokoyama: If there is something you want to see the Clan Head for... I'm afraid you have come at a bad time.
Yokoyama: No one can see the Clan Head before Her Excellency the Ogosho makes a judgement.
 Goodbye...
Yokoyama: Bye.
