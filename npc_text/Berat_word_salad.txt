Dialogue[]

Berat: Human eye can change the sea.
 Hello?
Berat: Hear me out and don't keep staring at the sea.
Berat: Otherwise, you'll just sit there and watch, unable to do anything else.
Berat: Until the sky and the sea eventually turn red and everything perishes, including you...
 The purple seawater...
Berat: Oh, you've seen the purple sea?
Berat: A pair of more treacherous eyes must've been watching it then, too!
Berat: Anyway, heed my warning...
Berat: Do not stare at the sea.
 See you.
Berat: Remember what I told you.
