Qiuwei: Hello, welcome.
 What do you sell here?
Qiuwei: You will need to pre-order silk and jewelry. Only some of the raw materials are in-stock items. Feel free to browse.
(Opens shop menu)
 What is this place?
Qiuwei: This is the store authorized by the Liyue Feiyun Commerce Guild. In other words, this store has the permission of the Feiyun Commerce Guild to do business.
Qiuwei: You can buy jewelry made of Liyue gems, and silk products made of Liyue specialties.
Qiuwei: The silk and jewelry require time to be crafted, so please make a reservation if you need them.
Qiuwei: In addition, you can also buy some of the raw materials directly from us.
 How's business?
Qiuwei: Very good. The Sumeru people have their own unique style of weaving, but they also seem to like Liyue specialties.
Qiuwei: The local Sumeru embroidery is very interesting, and the Feiyun Commerce Guild is trying to incorporate the characteristics of Sumeru textiles into their own products.
Qiuwei: Well... Fortunately, this kind of cultural handicraft doesn't seem to be considered an intellectual product forbidden for export by the Akademiya, or it would be difficult for us to ship back samples.
 See you.
Qiuwei: Take care, hope to see you again.
