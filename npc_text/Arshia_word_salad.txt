Dialogue[]

Arshia: My shopping went pretty well this time. I've almost bought everything I need.
 What are you buying?
Arshia: Nothing special, just some daily necessities.
Arshia: I live in Aaru Village near the desert. It does have a sufficient supply of underground water, but other supplies are not that sufficient, so I regularly travel to Caravan Ribat to purchase daily necessities.
Arshia: This place is close to the desert and packed with merchants, so it's convenient to buy just about anything here.
 About Aaru Village...
Arshia: If you head toward the western desert from Caravan Ribat, you should pass by Aaru Village if you don't stray too far from the path.
Arshia: Life there is simple, and bound by some traditional rules and regulations, but I'm really fond of the unique comforts of a small village that it presents.
Arshia: Everyone in the village is very friendly. It doesn't matter if you're a lost adventurer or an exiled researcher, we're willing to take you in all the same.
Arshia: ...Of course, you must have no malice toward the village. Otherwise, prepare to face the wrath of Candace.
 See you.
Arshia: See you.
