Maziar: Nice. I'll call it a day and report back to my aunt.
 Adventure Challenge
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Maziar: Unbelievable. I actually beat a veteran? Lady luck is shining on me!
(If the player wins the match)

Maziar: As I thought, beating a veteran is not easy...
(Before Condition missing)

 Huh?
Maziar: My aunt runs a hotel. There's only one hotel in Caravan Ribat, so it should be easy to find.
Maziar: I used to live in the city with my parents, but I really didn't have a thing for school, and it was annoying to be pushed by them every day. So I came here to work with my aunt.
Maziar: I learned a lot with her, and am getting more skilled at bargaining with vendors than ever.
Maziar: This is something you'll never learn from the Akasha Terminal.
(After Condition missing)

 Your aunt, you say?
Maziar: Yes, she runs a hotel. There's only one in Caravan Ribat, so it should be pretty easy to find.
Maziar: I used to live in the city with my parents, but I really didn't have a thing for school, and it was annoying to be pushed by them every day. So I came here to work with my aunt.
Maziar: I learned a lot with her and I'm getting more skilled at bargaining with vendors than ever.
Maziar: Even if the Akasha Terminals were still around, that wasn't something they could've taught you.
 Are you heading back?
Maziar: Hmm, not now. I just passed a camp of the Eremites, and he was not there. Maybe he went to the hotel looking for me for a drink.
Maziar: To be honest, most Sumeru people like to drink, but I'm not used to alcohol. I would feel dizzy after just half a glass.
Maziar: But it'd be a lack of decorum to refuse an Eremite. He often comes to invite me for a drink, and I should care about his feelings.
Maziar: I'll just stay out of his sight for now.
 See you.
Maziar: Goodbye.
