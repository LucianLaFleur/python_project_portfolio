Profile[]
As a young child, Avin was lively and active, often playing with an Aranara named Arashani. However, an unspecified illness struck her, making her unable to walk and having to use a wheelchair. As a result, Avin stopped leaving Sumeru City and couldn't meet Arashani anymore, so those memories became hazy and Avin's mood dropped.
When Yoimiya travels to Sumeru, she meets Avin and offers her a wooden Aranara toy from Port Ormos. This makes the girl remember her memories and leave the city hastily to meet Arashani. She has an accident and hilichurls take her wheelchair. Traveler finds and saves her, and meets another Aranara named Arapurva, who says that Arashani can be met in Mawtiyima Forest.
In Mawtiyima, Yoimiya, Traveler, and Avin enter a vivid dream sequence, in which Avin can walk and see the Aranara. They find a stone which Yoimiya calls "Avin's Urstone", symbolizing the girl's aspirations and wishes. Avin makes a monocle from the ore, through which Yoimiya sees a meteor shower. The whole experience significantly lifts Avin's mood.
After sending Avin home to her mother, Amurta doctors learn about the girls condition and implement a treatment plan, with Avin eagerly cooperating. When Yoimiya leaves Sumeru, Avin comes to Port Ormos to say goodbyes, promising to wait for her friend. She also says that she wants to travel to Inazuma and witness a firework show there.
