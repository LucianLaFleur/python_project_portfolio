Story[]
Currently, little is known about Zhong's history. He worked as a miner in the mines of Mingyun Village, and his messages on the village billboard are listed as the "Young Miner's Message." Based on the messages involving him, he held a vested interest in Yuan Hong's alleged hidden treasure, and was friends with Erge — although he didn't have a problem with using the ingredients intended for Erge to make Mushroom Pizza himself. At some point before the village was abandoned, Zhong got married and moved away.
Zhong either lived in or frequented Downriver, the fishing village Beidou spent roughly two years in as a child; after reading the Message Left On A Signboard, Beidou remarks that she barely remembers the name.[1] Based on the message left for him, he was away from the village when it was abandoned. It is unclear whether this is the same Zhong from Mingyun Village or if it is somebody else who goes by the same name.
