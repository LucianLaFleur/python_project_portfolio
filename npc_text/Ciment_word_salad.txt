Dialogue[]

Ciment: Proceed according to the plan?
Gacic: The instructions were clear, and the message you received should be the same as mine.
Ciment: What were the orders you received? Let's double-check.
Gacic: I don't want trouble. We'll each follow the instructions, do the job, and then leave with the Mora.
Ciment: Is your superior out at sea, or landside?
Gacic: ...
Gacic: What did I just say? No chit-chat. I don't want to end up sleeping with the fishes.
Ciment: Please. For all I know, your orders might be to slap some cement shoes on me and toss me in the harbor.
Gacic: If you stop asking questions, you won't have anything to worry about.
