Dialogue[]

Six-Fingered José: Hey, (‍AmigoAmigoText for Aether/AmigaAmigaText for Lumine‍)!
Six-Fingered José: You have a good pair of eyes, choosing to stop here in front of me!
Six-Fingered José: Do you want to hear my latest composition? I put my whole heart into it, and also my soul. How about it, amigo/amiga?
 About Stormterror...
(Between completing A Long Shot and ???)
Six-Fingered José: The days when the dragon was circling the city in the skies... Those were dark days for the people of this city...
Six-Fingered José: But just when the knights thought that all hope was lost, a miracle! A mystery traveler showed up out of nowhere and saved the day!
Six-Fingered José: I have decided to base my latest song on the true story of the mystery traveler of Mondstadt!
Six-Fingered José: Sure, so I added a little extra detail here and there... But that, my friend, is the work of the artist!
Six-Fingered José: With an exciting new story like this to tell, I'm sure to win my audience back!
 Have you seen anyone around that looks a lot like me?
Six-Fingered José: Someone that look a lot like you? Is it a relative of yours?
Six-Fingered José: Oh, then may I ask if that person is fond of wine?
Six-Fingered José: If they're out for a drink, then Mondstadt would be the place. And if it's the Mondstadt I know, they'd surely stop by the Angel's Share.
Six-Fingered José: I keep tabs on everyone I see in the Angel's Share. I'm always keeping an eye out for a potential audience, you know.
Six-Fingered José: But if the fellow you're looking for doesn't like to drink, then I'm afraid I don't have any clues for you. Lo siento.
 ...Um, who are you?
Six-Fingered José: You can call me Six-Fingered José, it's okay.
Six-Fingered José: I am a beloved bard of Mondstadt... Or I should say, I used to be beloved.
 Sing for me, José, por favor!
Six-Fingered José: Oh? You want to hear my latest song? I call it Ode to a Morning Breeze.
Six-Fingered José: ...I just need to tune my instrument.
Six-Fingered José: Oh no...
Six-Fingered José: I am so sorry. I have had no audience to play for for so long that now my strings are a little... I'll sing for you next time.
 Are there many other bards in Mondstadt?
Six-Fingered José: Are you kidding me, (‍amigoamigoText for Aether/amigaamigaText for Lumine‍)? Mondstadt is known all over for its songs from the pastures!
Six-Fingered José: But lately a mysterious bard appeared in this place. I checked all over, but can't find out anything about him.
Six-Fingered José: Since he came here, my audience has slowly disappeared.
Six-Fingered José: I did consider a battle of the bards...
Six-Fingered José: But I think even I would be seduced by his beautiful voice...
 How does one become a bard?
Six-Fingered José: Hmm... Well, I became one by trial and error, and a desire to become famous—
Six-Fingered José: Uh, I mean, a desire to bring enjoyment to everyone! Yes, that's why I became a bard.
Six-Fingered José: Why don't you give this book a read first? Maybe you might be able to figure it out yourself.
(Obtain  Breeze Amidst the Forest - Ballad Selection Excerpt)
 Goodbye.
Six-Fingered José: Leaving so soon? You are a busy bee.
Six-Fingered José: If you ever have time to spare, I won't complain if you come here and show me some appreciation.

Event Dialogue[]
Invitation of Windblume and Windblume's Breath[]

Six-Fingered José: Hey there, (‍amigoamigoText for Aether/amigaamigaText for Lumine‍)! Are you here to listen to Six-Fingered José's latest composition?
Six-Fingered José: Hehe, fear not. My creations do not disappoint.
Six-Fingered José: When it comes to the Windblume Festival, other bards think love songs. Madre mía, no sense of invention...
Six-Fingered José: I, Six-Fingered José, on the other hand, am not constrained by convention. I wish to eulogize the heroic epics of ages past! The people must remember that this is a day for commemorating heroes and resisting tyrants!
Six-Fingered José: Even if, ahem... I haven't quite finished the last part yet. But once it's complete, it will bring my audience running back!
(Dialogue options and responses are the same as normal)

Trivia[]
As mentioned in the Gliding Instruction Manual, José tried playing his lyre while gliding and fell into the wishing well as a result. His gliding license was suspended for five years for reckless gliding and he had to perform community service for three months.
José gives the introductory quote in Diluc's official introduction, where he likens Diluc to "a fine wine but with too much ice. The first sip tastes heavenly, but drink too much and it gives you brain freeze." For this statement, Charles temporarily kicked him out of Angel's Share.
