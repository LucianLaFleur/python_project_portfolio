Firnas is a scholar at Sumeru Akademiya. Hosseini mentions him in passing while talking about "our great tutor Firnas."[1]
A "great master Firnas" is mentioned in Wings of the Forest's description, which recounts how he tried, and failed, to invent a Wind Glider that did not require Barbatos' blessings. The narrator emphasizes twice that this Firnas "is not the current great lecturer," although the truthfulness of this statement is left to reader interpretation.
