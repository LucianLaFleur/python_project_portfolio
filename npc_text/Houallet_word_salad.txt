Media:VO Houallet 01.ogg "Monsieur Nouvelle, please, there's no need to be so modest."

Dialogue[]

Houallet: Trust me, your story will be a thing of honor in Fontaine — indeed, in all of Teyvat!
Monsieur Volonte Nouvelle: Really, it wasn't all that complicated...
Houallet: No need to be so modest, good sir!
Houallet: Would any less dramatic a tale be worthy of your title, "Monsieur"?
Monsieur Volonte Nouvelle: Well, then I can only repeat the statement I gave the Maison Gardiennage...
Monsieur Volonte Nouvelle: That day, I saw someone run past, followed by a cry of "someone catch that thief"!
Monsieur Volonte Nouvelle: So I grabbed the crowbar next to me and swept it outward...
Houallet: Yes, of course, I've written all that down. But was there anything else...?
