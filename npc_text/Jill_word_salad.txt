Dialogue[]

Jill: Hi...? Is something wrong?
 Found any nice shells on the beach?
Jill: Er... Sorry, I don't really like shells.
 So what do you like?
Jill: Crabs, obviously. Don't you think it's cute, how they walk sideways?
Jill: And they're even harder to catch than fish! Hey, since you're so interested, you might as well take 'em. Here.
Jill: I can always catch more, it's no big deal.
(Obtain  Crab ×4).
 What are you hanging out here for?
Jill: Can you see Mr. Guard over there?
Jill: Me and Will wanna go and play with Ms. Edith at Windrise...
Jill: But Mr. Guard keeps following us and we can't get rid of him. I'm a bit scared, he looks like a bad guy.
Jill: That's why we ended up here, because we're trying to run away from him.
 Goodbye.
Jill: Bye-bye!
