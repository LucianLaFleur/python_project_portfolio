Dialogue[]

Arya: Hmph!
 Who made you so upset?
Arya: He idles days and days away, making all kinds of excuses for himself.
Arya: We grew up together, so I know him very well.
Arya: If you see someone who talks about "fated encounters" don't trust him!
Arya: He's a real sweet talker, but all he's actually capable of is dilly-dallying on the street.
Arya: I hope my little brother won't follow his example and turn out to be a layabout like him...
 Your little brother...
Arya: Yeah, I have a young brother. He should be out playing with his friends at the moment.
Arya: He has taken a great interest in Sumpter Beasts recently for some reason.
Arya: His friend's family seems to have Sumpter Beasts at home, and he goes there at every opportunity.
Arya: Every time a merchant delivered something to our house, he would fix his eyes on the Sumpter Beast carrying the goods.
Arya: Well... I suppose it's not bad for him to learn about merchants' job in his early age. When he grows up, he can help with the family business.
 See you later.
Arya: See you.
