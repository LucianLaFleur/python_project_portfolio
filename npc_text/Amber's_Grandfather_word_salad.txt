When Mondstadt accepted me, it became my homeland. Then I decided to watch over this new home of mine. Maybe one day, you will inherit this responsibility... Hah, but then, who knows what the future holds?—Amber's grandfather, to Amber

Story[]
Amber's grandfather was a mercenary from Liyue Harbor and the leader of a mercenary group that took on merchant caravan protection jobs. One of these jobs went wrong, and Amber's grandfather was the sole survivor, saved by a doctor from the Knights of Favonius. As he was too ashamed to return home and also wanted to repay the debt, he joined the Knights of Favonius. He founded the Outriders and personally trained all of its members.
Later, he fell in love and started a family in Mondstadt. His granddaughter, Amber, was born years later. When she was young, Amber would secretly watch her grandfather training the Outriders, and sneak outside at night to practice the moves he taught.  Moved by her enthusiasm, he decided to teach her everything he knew.[1] At some point in Amber's youth, he also became acquainted with Eula, an estranged member of the disgraced Lawrence Clan who was struggling to deal with the shadow her family's dark past cast over her life. Amber's grandfather took her under his wing[2] and trained her. The two were similar, one an outcast of Liyue and the other an exile of Mondstadt.[3] She became a beloved student to him and a close friend to Amber.[2] Amber's grandfather taught Eula an open-mindedness and down-to-earth persistence, helping her to find herself and discover a way to persevere through the difficulties her bloodline caused her.[4]
Amber's grandfather knew how to cook, and would make dishes from his native Liyue for Amber all the time. After training together all day, Amber would sit patiently at the table while he cooked dinner in the kitchen. Sometimes they'd have Eula around for dinner, and even though she'd always find something to complain about, Amber could tell she also really enjoyed the food.[5]
Four years before the start of the game, Amber's grandfather left his coat of arms and sword in his office and disappeared without a trace, shortly after Amber had been admitted into the Outriders. After his disappearance, Amber committed herself to continuing as an Outrider, desiring to take up her grandfather's former role as Mondstadt's loyal protector.[6]
Based on the description in the Qingce Village Bulletin Board, it is implied that he returned to Qingce Village, but where he lives or why he came back is unknown.

I often use it to imitate the sound of the sea, which is where I get my title of "Spindrift Knight" — this despite the fact that the bone whistle is actually a Liyue tradition.... But then again, no one seems to look too closely into that kind of thing. I'm mean, they took me on, and I'm an exile of Mondstadt trained by an outcast of Liyue...
