Dialogue[]

Pops Zhou: Welcome! Please take a seat!
 I'd like to have some tea, please.
Pops Zhou: I don't carry any famous teas, but the flavor of what I do have is quite good if I must say so myself. Go ahead, have a sip!
(Opens Pop's Teas menu)
 Where's this?
Pops Zhou: This is Stone Gate. Keep heading south from here and you'll reach Liyue.
Pops Zhou: Can I get you a cup of tea?
 You are...?
Pops Zhou: I am the owner of this tea booth. It's not a lucrative business, but you do get to hear a lot of stories.
Pops Zhou: Hehehe... Honestly, the thing I love most about running this booth is watching all the travelers come and go, and listening to all the stories they have to tell.
 Stories?
Pops Zhou: Look at me, traveler, I'm just an old bag of bones.
Pops Zhou: I've never had to weather any great storms in my life, it's been smooth sailing all the way through.
Pops Zhou: But when I got old, I started feeling as if I was missing out.
Pops Zhou: So I packed a few things and left Mt. Qingce behind...
Pops Zhou: Once I left Qingce Village, I decided that this was where I was going to set up a booth. I don't do anything here except chat to people; listen to their stories, tell them mine... And I'm thoroughly enjoying it!
 Goodbye.
Pops Zhou: Bye then, take it easy!
Pops Zhou: In the end, you only regret the chances you didn't take!

Pops Zhou: Haha, young folks these days... Always brimming with new ideas.
Pops Zhou: A poetry gala... Ah, thinking back on my youth, I certainly had stories I could put to paper back then...
Pops Zhou: *sigh* ...The world is eternal, but youth is ephemeral...
