Dialogue[]

Zhila: Oh! I was lost in thought! What a jump scare you are!
Zhila: Oh no, where was I...
 It wasn't intentional...
Zhila: Don't worry, I'm not blaming you. Please don't mind me.
Zhila: It's my own fault. My memory has been failing me lately. I either forget what I'm supposed to deliver, or forget what I'm supposed to sell...
Zhila: Luckily, the owner of this place has more important things to worry about than the insignificant work I'm in charge of.
Zhila: Well, enough of that, let me continue thinking. Where the heck did I put a long list like that?
 I'll leave you to it, then.
Zhila: *sigh* See you, I'm going to try recalling it again...
