Profile[]
Ilyas is a scholar from the Akademiya who is currently incarcerated due to his participation in activities considered illegal by the Akademiya.
It is not known what Darshan Ilyas was in while in the Akademiya. While in the Akademiya, Ilyas had a friend named Raju, whose work was plagiarized by their instructor, Jani, which ultimately drove him to suicide. While Ilyas had stayed quiet on his request, Raju's death was too much for him to bear and Ilyas exposed the affair, leading to Jani's arrest, as well as ostracism from Jani's peers who were involved in his project. This ostracism affected Ilyas's prospects within the Akademiya as his peers would refuse to associate with him in any future projects; this, along with an implied disapproval by his parents due to his actions, took a toll on him mentally.
It was around this time that Ilyas was confronted by a scholar from the Vahumana Darshan named Siraj, who recruited him into his project involving a "collective consciousness", not knowing of Siraj's ulterior motives in wanting to install himself as the Akademiya's new Sage. To aid this, Ilyas was made an amnesiac by Siraj and fed suggestions into his mind to draw out Alhaitham, Siraj's archrival, to kill him and speed up the process; he would be given the moniker of Siraj No. 36. Ilyas meets Alhaitham, who engages in conversation with him; Alhaitham however sees through Ilyas's ruse and begins encouraging his individuality over their numerous conversations, leading Ilyas to question his position within the mind.
Ilyas later returns to the collective consciousness and exposes his true colors to Alhaitham, having acted as Siraj's "mole" and proclaiming himself as Siraj No. 36. The various thoughts implanted in Ilyas's conscience however regarding Ilyas questioning his number in the pecking order begin to influence the thoughts of the members in Siraj's consciousness, causing the mind to become unstable and break down. Ilyas is subsequently arrested by the Matra after the destabilization of the mind.
