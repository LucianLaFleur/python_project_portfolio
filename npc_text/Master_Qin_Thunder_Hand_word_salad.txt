Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing Transient Dreams)
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Hey, pal, do you know the way to Narukami Island?
 Who are you?
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Everyone calls me Master Qin. You can go with that name.
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": I'm a martial artist from Liyue hired by the Communications Office. Right now, I'm working as a bodyguard for a merchant called Li Xiao.
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": I had wanted to visit Inazuma before. That's why I took this job.
 You want to go to Narukami Island?
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Yeah, staying in Ritou is so boring.
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": And I have already escorted my employer to Inazuma safely. The job is considered done anyway. Isn't it up to me, then, where I want to go next?
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": It's such a rare opportunity. I even passed through that stormy ocean. Why shouldn't I go see the world a bit more?
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Since I am here, I have to figure out what it's like to live in Inazuma, haha!
 Why did you come to Inazuma?
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Hmm, I heard that the locals excel in swordsmanship, and I wanted to see it for myself.
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": I'm not boasting. I've already defeated half of the fighters in Liyue with my unique technique, Rumbling Hand. No one's been a match for me yet!
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": I have not only won the title of Crux Clash Champion, but also clocked the teeth off some of those so-called ace fighters who possess Visions...
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Going undefeated all these years is just too boring! Hmph, so I just want to see the world, challenge fighters everywhere, and learn about foreign cultures.
 That sounds very adventurous!
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Haha, so you are a member of the Adventurers' Guild?
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Hmm, not bad! Now that I've been praised by an adventurer, I'll have to try even harder.
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": These are the experiences that I've accumulated in my previous adventures. I'll share them with you.
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": If you learn anything new, please tell me!
(Obtain  Hero's Wit ×2)
 Goodbye.
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": If you find a way to get to Narukami Island, don't forget to tell me! I will treat you to Inazuman matcha!

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After completing Transient Dreams)
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Why hello there, friend! You look like someone who has a few tricks up their sleeve. How about a few go-arounds with me in the ring?
 Who are you?
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Everyone calls me Master Qin. You can go with that name.
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": I'm a martial artist hired by the Communications Office. Right now, I'm working as a bodyguard for a merchant called Li Xiao.
 "Go-arounds"?
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Why, of course! Not to boast or anything, but I've already defeated half of the fighters in Liyue with my unique technique, Rumbling Hand. No one's been a match for me yet!
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": I have not only won the title of Crux Clash Champion, but also clocked the teeth off some of those so-called ace fighters who possess Visions...
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": I traveled through Inazuma previously. Not a single fighter of note to be found, I tell you! Disappointing, is what it was!
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": That's why I've returned to Liyue recently. I mean, who knows, maybe some new talent has arisen while I away [sic] that might be worth a bout or two.
 That sounds very adventurous!
(If Hero's Wit is not yet obtained)
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Haha, so you are a member of the Adventurers' Guild?
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Hmm, not bad! Now that I've been praised by an adventurer, I'll have to try even harder.
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": These are the experiences that I've accumulated in my previous adventures. I'll share them with you.
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": If you learn anything new, please tell me!
(Obtain  Hero's Wit ×2)
 See you.
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Aye. If you ever want to have a match, I'm ready anytime!
