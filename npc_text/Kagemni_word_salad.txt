Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises)
Kagemni: What are you staring at, huh?
Kagemni: Just look at you! Could it be that you're a lapdog of the Dendro Archon?
 ...
Kagemni: As desert-dwellers, it is our duty to retain our faith in King Deshret!
Kagemni: He will return to us, and when that day comes, he will return the faithful to our former prosperity and glory!
Kagemni: As for those of you who betrayed King Deshret... You'll pay for all that you've done!
 ...
Kagemni: Hah! Thought as much.

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After completing Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises)
Kulsoom: Do you now understand where you went wrong?
Kagemni: Yes... I know...
Kulsoom: And where was that exactly?
Kagemni: I... I shouldn't have trusted in rumors...
Kulsoom: And?
Kagemni: And, uh... I... I shouldn't have gone babbling to your grandson about that hearsay?
Kulsoom: Well, that was wrong of you, yes, but is that really the most important thing?
Kulsoom: What's the point of just "knowing" things? Do them! That's the important part!
Kulsoom: It's because you're always lounging around at home that you wound up believing those baseless rumors!
Kulsoom: You're still young — you've still got all the time in the world to learn new things. Why don't you follow Setaria's example and go study?
Kagemni: Y—Yes, you're right...
