Imunlaukr was a historical figure that lived in Sal Vindagnyr at the time of its fall.
He is also the namesake of the Imunlaukr Clan, one of the founding clans of Barbatos' Mondstadt after Barbatos became the Anemo Archon 2,600 years ago.

Story[]
Little is known about Imunlaukr's origins; however, he is called an outlander by those of Sal Vindagnyr,[1] indicating he is not a native to that region. At some point, he settled in Sal Vindagnyr and grew close to its princess.
After the Skyfrost Nail drastically changed the environment in the once-verdant land, Imunlaukr departed to find a way to save the nation.[2] He returned empty-handed, however, and found that the nation's inhabitants all died in his absence.
Greatly aggrieved and disillusioned, Imunlaukr parted with his sword, the Snow-Tombed Starsilver, and went to seek out a place to fight. His life afterwards is unknown, but he had descendants who became the Imunlaukr Clan.[3]

Trivia[]
Imunlaukr's name likely originates from an Old Norse stanza by Norwegian skald Eyvindr Finnsson skáldaspillir, in which he used ímun-laukr, literally "war-leek," as a kenning for a sword. The same stanza, in turn, uses Ullr ímunlauks ("Ullr of the sword") as a kenning for a warrior, which matches his description.
It's likely that Imunlaukr fought creatures from the Abyss during his time away from the mountain, as he returned with black blood dripping from his weapon, which is similar to the description of the Mondstadt expedition to Khaenri'ah to face the monsters spreading from there.[4]
