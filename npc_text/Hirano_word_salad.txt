Dialogue[]

Hirano: Hello. Do you need help with anything?
 What is this place?
Hirano: This is the mansion of the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission. It is also the place where the Commissioner works. Outsiders aren't usually allowed here.
Hirano: But I remember that you are a guest of Miss Kamisato... In which case, please be my guest.
 You're pretty relaxed, eh...
Hirano: Ah, well.. Ahem, you are right. As the guard of the Kamisato Mansion, I shouldn't really let my guard down.
Hirano: I have a friend who is also a guard at the Tenryou Commission. He told me that he was very worried about those people affected by the Vision Hunt Decree seeking revenge.
Hirano: Now that I think of it, the peaceful Kamisato Clan is far safer than the other two Commissions, who've made a lot of enemies.
Hirano: This might also be because Mr. Thoma is too reliable. I have always felt safe here. Hahaha...
 About Thoma...
Hirano: When Mr. Thoma first came to the Kamisato Clan, people suspected him on account of his being an outlander.
Hirano: But from my observations, Mr. Thoma is steady and friendly ⁠— and he is a truly reliable fellow.
Hirano: I mean, why else would he be the trusted assistant of the Commissioner and Miss Kamisato, right? Haha!
 Goodbye.
Hirano: Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!
