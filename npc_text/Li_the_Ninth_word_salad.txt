 This is fine wine...
Media:VO Li the Ninth 01.ogg "Mmm, this is fine wine. Fine wine, indeed!"

Dialogue[]

Li the Ninth: When the taste of the finest wine doth flow through mine own throat, on springs of thoughts deep and divine, the strings of verse do float!
 Who're you?
Li the Ninth: I... am Li the Ninth, a poet.
Li the Ninth: People wax lyrical about the fine food served on the Pearl Galley. But I say that the wine is best!
Li the Ninth: I've had many a cup, yet my thirst is not yet quenched. Each one is different from the last... a fine brew indeed!
 See you, then.
Li the Ninth: Nothing more could a man as for, but on such fine wine to dine.
