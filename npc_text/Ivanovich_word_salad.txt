Dialogue[]

Ivanovich: Good day, my friend! My apologies, but I am out of stock at the moment. Please try again next time.
 Who are you...?
Ivanovich: I am Ivanovich, pleasure to meet you! I am a businessman from Snezhnaya. I am now waiting for my next delivery.
Ivanovich: The people of Liyue are very wealthy! I import goods from Snezhnaya and everything sells out almost as soon as it arrives.
Ivanovich: If I had known sooner, I would have opened my own store here so I could sell directly to consumers. That way I would not have to oversee the deliveries myself.
 What do you sell?
Ivanovich: Technically I am a distributor, selling everyday items produced in Snezhnaya. As well as that, I also act as an agent for Cor Lapis merchants selling to Snezhnayan factories.
Ivanovich: The Qixing have been keeping a close eye on Snezhnaya's senior officials recently...
Ivanovich: Some people say that the only reason we are able to buy Cor Lapis from Liyue merchants is because they were mediating behind the scenes...
Ivanovich: But I am not privy to the details. So please excuse me from withholding judgment.
Ivanovich: Although our goods are produced in high quantities, they are by no means cheap.
Ivanovich: So I have a high opinion of Liyue consumers... Their spending always exceeds our projections.
 Why's it so chilly here?
Ivanovich: You too? Aha, so it's not just me, after all...
Ivanovich: I'm wearing plenty of layers, but somehow I'm so cold that I can't stop shivering. Let me see what's going on...
Ivanovich: Aha! Turns out I had this stone in my pocket all along. Hmm, must have slipped in there somehow while I was back home...
Ivanovich: Hmm? Piqued your curiosity, has it? Well, it's not classed as ore, and I certainly can't sell it here... So, I may as well let you have it.
(Obtain  Shivada Jade Fragment ×1)
 See you.
Ivanovich: Take care. Hope to see you again when we are fully stocked.

Event Dialogue[]
Lantern Rite[]

Ivanovich: The glow of the Xiao Lanterns feels so warm...
Ivanovich: Even as a stranger in this foreign city, seeing the brightly lit streets and Xiao Lanterns above in the night sky still brings some indescribable warmth to my heart.
Ivanovich: Such a warm feeling reminds me of our "Krsnik Noc" in Snezhnaya.
Ivanovich: If you ever have the chance, you must visit Snezhnaya and participate in one of our festivals.

Moonlight Merriment[]

Ivanovich: The Moonchase Festival really is a busy time. Looking at all the locals running about preparing food, I can't help but be tempted to try my hand at it myself.
Ivanovich: Do you think some Snezhnayan fare and some grilled pies and such would sell well?
(Dialogue options and responses are the same as normal)

The Exquisite Night Chimes[]

(After completing A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul)
Ivanovich: The glow of the Xiao Lanterns feels so warm...
Ivanovich: And I don't know if it's because of the music festival performance, but the stage lights made the lantern even brighter.
Ivanovich: This blazing heat ignites a nostalgic flame in me...
(Continue non-event dialogue)

Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze[]

Ivanovich: I never knew kites came in so many styles...
Ivanovich: Ah, don't worry, I didn't mean anything untoward by that.
Ivanovich: Variety and novelty are a merchant's great loves, after all!
Ivanovich: If we could use such stylizations in other products... Hmm, perhaps bring in some of those Fontainian machines we're importing... Yes, that could be a promising new market.
