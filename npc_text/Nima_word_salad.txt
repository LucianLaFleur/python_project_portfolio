Dialogue[]

Nima: Raranana, Raranana, when will you come see me!
 What are you singing?
Nima: It's a song I wrote myself!
Nima: Maybe Raranana would visit me again if they heard the song.
 Who's Raranana?
Nima: Small, round friends.
Nima: Raranana would appear when the adults aren't around, just like me slacking off farming work.
Nima: But Minoo always made fun of me all the time for believing in Raranana, and got mad at me for saying the name wrong.
Nima: I've seen Raranana with my own eyes, though... They're the weedfolk, so Raranana does exist for sure.
 See you.
Nima: Raranana, Raranana, when will I see you again!
