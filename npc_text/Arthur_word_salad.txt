Dialogue[]

Arthur: What are you doing coming over here? I don't need your help.
 About Stormterror...
(unlocked after completing "A Long Shot")
Arthur: Hmph, what a shame. I thought that this was my big chance, but it was all over before I could even pull the sword out.
Arthur: If only I had, then I would have been able to defeat Stormterror. I mean, it's a sword of legend, and so I must be...
Arthur: What? Me, scared? I was never scared, I just hadn't pulled the sword out yet!
 What is it that you're doing, anyway?
Arthur: I'm trying to pull this sword out. Don't you get any ideas, I found it first!
Arthur: If only I could pull it out, then...
Arthur: ...Okay so I don't know what would actually happen, but it'd definitely be something big!
Arthur: Look at the rust, the angle of entry into the ground... It's perfect. It's got to be a lost sword from some legend or another, I'm sure of it!
Arthur: Armed with this sword, I... I'd probably be allowed to go on adventures with mommy and daddy. And I could join the Adventurers' Guild!
 Goodbye.
Arthur: Yeah, you should go. Don't tell anyone a thing about the sword!

Trivia[]
The sword he's staring at is actually one of Schulz's productions that Wagner wouldn't let him sell, so he took out back to swing around. He stuck it in the ground in its current position and, upon seeing that some kids got attracted to it, decided to leave it as-is.
Arthur is a reference to King Arthur and the Sword in the Stone.
