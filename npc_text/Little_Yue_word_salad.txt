Little Yue  (Chinese: 小月 Xiǎo Yuè) is a young boy aboard the Alcor, anchored south of Guyun Stone Forest, Liyue. He can be found roaming the deck and inspecting the crates during daytime.
His parents were both sailors on the Crux Fleet but died during their voyages, leaving him orphaned. Beidou and the rest of the fleet then decided to raise him themselves.
Little Yue is friends with Changchang in Liyue Harbor.

Dialogue[]

Little Yue: Hey there, wanna join the Cygnus Fleet? If you join now, you'll be my second!
 The Cygnus Fleet?
Little Yue: It's my very own fleet! It's just me right now, but one day, it'll grow into something big!
Little Yue: My Ma and Pa were both sailors in the fleet, but they were returned to the sea during a voyage, so Captain Beidou took me in...
Little Yue: We have a saying here, it says "the new surpasses the old." Captain Beidou is the one who raised me, my fleet mustn't be an embarrassment to her!
Little Yue: I've always wanted to be a sailor myself, but the Captain's forbidden me to go out to sea, saying that it's too dangerous. So this time, I've secretly stowed aboard...
Little Yue: I got an earful from Uncle Juza, but I got to go out to sea, and that makes me a sailor now!
 Anything you can tell me about the crew?
Little Yue: Sure. I know everything about everyone!
 Do tell me about the Chief Mate.
Little Yue: Uncle Juza's real huge, and he looks scary, but he's a great guy!
Little Yue: ...Well, and his ears aren't all too good either.
Little Yue: He always mishears what we say. Says it's our fault we're always saying things only insects can hear.
Little Yue: Funny thing is, though, that he only gets like this on land.
Little Yue: It's so noisy out at sea with the crashing waves and all, but somehow he hears us just fine out there. It's really weird...
 So, about the crew...
Little Yue: Well, Uncle Liushi loves to sing from the crow's nest. At first, no one knew who was doing that. Almost thought it was a ghost!
Little Yue: Then there's Aunt Furong. Sometimes, when she's alone, she says the Captain's name over and over, and her face is all red...
Little Yue: Oh yeah, and there's Aunt Yinxing, who really loves animals. You can't take pets on board, so she raises a few fish in her cups...
Little Yue: ...So there was this one time when Uncle Sea Drake got dead drunk, and he drank her fish with his grog. Till today, she has no clue how they went missing...
 About Kaedehara Kazuha...
(After completing Autumn Winds, Scarlet Leaves)‍[could it be unlocked earlier than this?]
Little Yue: Eh? That name sure sounds familiar... Oh, right, you mean that red-garbed guy from abroad!
Little Yue: He always sits by himself saying some real complicated stuff... But I've heard Uncle Liushi say that this guy can tell the weather as well as he can!
Little Yue: He even played me a tune once on a leaf. I never even knew that was possible!
Little Yue: So... I guess he's a good guy!
 See you around.
Little Yue: Seeya. Sign up soon if you want to join my fleet!
