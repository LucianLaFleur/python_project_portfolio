Monroe is an open-world NPC in the City of Mondstadt. He can be found praying in front of the God Statue in front of the Favonius Cathedral alongside Susie and Grace, with Sayid nearby to observe the prayer group.
He tells the Traveler that he has never missed a meeting, thinking it is better than being at home, doing nothing.

Dialogue[]

Monroe: Why don't you pray with us, my friend?
 About Stormterror... (Only available between "Dragon Storm" and "A Long Shot")
Monroe: *sigh* If this keeps up, I might have to considering moving to Springvale to wait it out...
Monroe: I believe that Lord Barbatos willn understand. No matter where you pray from; you will receive an answer if your heart is pure.
Monroe: ...But it would still be best if we didn't have to leave, so please, Lord Barbatos, protect your pious people!
 What are you doing?
Monroe: On days like these, nuns in the Church will hold a prayer meeting.
Monroe: I've never missed a single meeting. Rather than being idle at home, joining the meeting is much more meaningful to me.
Monroe: Being pious is always a good thing, right?
 Goodbye.
Monroe: Goodbye. Barbatos shall bless those who are pious.
