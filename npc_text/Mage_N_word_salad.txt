Profile[]
Nicole is a prophetess and an extraordinary woman studying Teyvat's direction and order. She is said to offer help to those in need of guidance, which led her to be known by other members of the Hexenzirkel as the "guide who will never get lost." She has a habit of speaking directly into people's minds without warning.[6]
Nicole may be physically mute, as she described herself as "suffocated by [her] inability to speak," and Wolfy mentions that one of Madam Mage's friends is a mute person who likes to speak in people's heads. She has messy handwriting due to a lack of practice.[7]

Story[]
Nicole was incredibly talkative at first, and she would set her head abuzz and give herself quite a headache whenever she spoke. Alice advised her to speak more steadily and present an air of mystery and nobility, which is how she developed her current manner of speaking.[7]
While the Traveler ruminates on the consequences of a person's removal from Irminsul following the incident with the Wanderer, who had removed his previous incarnation as Scaramouche from Irminsul and affected Teyvat's known history, a mysterious voice speaks to the Traveler and Paimon, telling them: "Unfortunately, the fate of Teyvat cannot easily be changed. Perhaps a god may have a slim chance, but for anyone else... who can say. [...] History does not change easily, but human hearts can. Believe your own eyes. Only that which you see is true. What is unseen is but an illusion." Her voice disappears after that, leaving no clue as to her identity.[8]
Alice gives a brief description of Nicole while describing the members of the Hexenzirkel, explaining that Nicole only speaks to guide people toward the truth when a change has occurred in the world. The Traveler suspects Nicole is the one who spoke to them and Paimon at the end of As Though Morning Dew if that quest was completed before the Event Story Quest Joy Above the Clouds in Windblume's Breath: Windblume Festival: Part III.[6]
A disordered fable in someone's dream left by Nicole for Furina's official introduction states that as one lie follows another, "justice" waits inescapably at the end, and those who are ignorant by believing such to be a farce merely deceive themselves.
During Chapter IV of the Archon Quests, Nicole appeared at the Spina di Rosula base in Fleuve Cendre and confirmed to the Traveler that the prophecy would come to fruition. However, she stated that prophecies are merely the future in the perspective of the gods, and that the gods are not omniscient; ultimately, she advises the Traveler to simply play their part.[9]

Trivia[]
The teacup that Nicole speaks through in Chapter IV: Act V - Masquerade of the Guilty is one of the teacups on the Hexenzirkel's floating island.
It is identical to the teacups found in the Dawn Winery, matching the carpet under the dining table and the back of Diluc's coat.
Nicole wrote Vol. 5 of The Little Witch and the Undying Fire.
Etymology[]
Nicole ultimately derives from the name Nikolaos (Greek: Νικόλαος Nikólaos), a compound of νίκη nikē, "victory" and λαός laos, "people."
Her Chinese name 尼可 Níkě may be a variant of the name of the Greek goddess Nike  (Chinese: 尼刻 Níkè) or the common Chinese transcription of the name Nicole  (Chinese: 妮可 Nīkě).
