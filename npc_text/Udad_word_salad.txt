Dialogue[]

Udad: Maybe too much studying makes one unable to speak plainly.
 Something on your mind?
Udad: A little. It's not a big problem, but I'm still stressed.
Udad: Like a few days ago, I heard some scholars in the tavern discussing something about a "grand conservator."
Udad: So I asked them how much conservation is grand conservation, and they didn't seem to understand what I was asking.
Udad: I'm a trustworthy battle-hardened veteran, yet the Parchamdar has to bail me out every time I try to talk to a scholar. It's pretty embarrassing...
 Perhaps.
Udad: Why can't they just spit it out?
