Mori is a quest-exclusive NPC that appears in World Quest The Story of "the Princess" and "the Adventure Team" in Series Ann of the Narzissenkreuz: Act I - The Narzissenkreuz Adventure.
Despite appearing as a boar, Mori is stated to be a dog, much to the Traveler and Paimon's confusion. He is loosely based on Seymour, Mary-Ann's robotic dog.
