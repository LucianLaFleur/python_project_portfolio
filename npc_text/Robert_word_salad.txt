Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
Robert: *sigh* Friend, could you please take a look at this and tell me what else I have to do to complete my application?
 What's with your application?
Robert: I've heard that it's become very troublesome to apply for a visit to Inazuma recently. Therefore, I asked a friend from Snezhnaya to help me.
Robert: I went through much trouble to get the documents ready and came all the way here with a fleet...
Robert: In the end, that inspector named Yurika kept saying that I am still missing some "materials," which need to be added on.
Robert: But I don't get it. Apart from these documents, what else do I still need?
 Have you... brought your wallet?
Robert: Huh, my wallet?
Robert: I do have my wallet with me. But I'm not in the habit of putting documents in my wallet. And I've already brought all the things that they need...
Robert: *sigh* I've been staying in Ritou for too long. I don't really have any more cash left... If I can't sell my goods in the city, I'll be in trouble...
Robert: There isn't much I can do with this small amount of money. I might as well go for a drink at Miss Ryouko's stall.
Robert: Miss Ryouko will be able to console me for sure, bless her kind soul.
 Sorry, I can't really help you...
Robert: *sigh* That's okay. Thank you for your concern anyway... I will figure out a way...

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
Robert: Alas, the application still can't be done. It's even more troublesome now...
 What's with your application?
Robert: *sigh* Let me tell you my story. I'm so unlucky!
Robert: Previously, I asked a Snezhnayan friend for help, and prepared all the documents painstakingly. I came a long way here with the fleet...
Robert: In the end, I never got the Travel Permit application done because I didn't understand their "handling fee" standard!
Robert: Now, the Kanjou Commission is undergoing an inspection from the authorities, and is no longer asking for exorbitant fees...
 I'd consider that an improvement.
Robert: Well, less taxation is always good, but with all these delays, all the documents I prepared beforehand have expired!
Robert: They now all need updating, and I was going to look for my Snezhnayan friend for some help there — it's funny, you know? I can't contact him at all...
Robert: I've been stuck on Ritou for so long, I'm almost out of Mora on hand. Oh, what am I going to do...
Robert: There isn't much I can do with this small amount of money. I might as well go for a drink at Miss Ryouko's stall.
Robert: Miss Ryouko will be able to console me for sure, bless her kind soul.
 Sorry, I couldn't help you...
Robert: *sigh* that's okay. Thank you for your concern anyway... I will figure out a way...

Dialogue Set #3[]

(After completing Transient Dreams)
Robert: Let me see. If I want to set up shop here in Ritou, I'll need these... and these...
 Opening a store?
Robert: Aye, yes. As you know, the Sakoku Decree has been abolished.
Robert: So honestly, I could return to Mondstadt at any time. But I just can't do it - I mean, how can I just leave Inazuma without having done any business here?
Robert: And I've heard the news, you know — about all the people coming here to Ritou, looking to establish their businesses. That really gets my fingers itching, you know? So... What do you think? Should I give this a go?
 Sounds like a good idea.
Robert: I know, right? If I can set up early, I might just hit upon some good opportunities first.
Robert: But I reckon that my documents are going to need updating first. I was going to ask my Snezhnayan friend for help, actually, but I haven't been able to contact him at all...
Robert: I been stuck here in Ritou so long. I'm almost out of Mora on hand. Oh, what am I going to do...
Robert: You know what? I think I'll just go over to Miss Ryouko's for a drink. She'll be able to console me for sure, bless her kind soul.
 Sorry to bother you, then.
Robert: *sigh* That's okay. I'll figure something out...

Hues of the Violet Garden[]

(After completing The Strange Tale of Suikou's Tipsy Tincture)
Robert: I'm quite tired of fretting about the paperwork needed to open a store. Should I just invite Ms. Ryouko to come to the festival with me?
Robert: But she's got so many customers right now... Ah, what do I do...
