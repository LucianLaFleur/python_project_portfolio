The Traveler's Sibling is the lost twin sibling of the Traveler and the prince/princess of the Abyss Order. The primary goal for the Traveler in Genshin Impact is to find and reunite with their sibling — traveling throughout Teyvat, obtaining information about them from meeting with members of The Seven.
The gender and name of the sibling depend on the player's choice at the beginning of the game during their fight against the Unknown God. If the player chooses male, the lost sibling is a female named Lumine; if the player chooses female, the lost sibling is a male named Aether.

Appearance[]
The physical appearance of the sibling is very similar to the Traveler's. Both have slim figures, (‍blondblondText for male Traveler/blondeblondeText for female Traveler‍) hair, golden-yellow eyes, and very pale skin. Lumine's hair is a bob cut with shoulder-length, straight twin-tails; while Aether's is medium cut with a long braid.
Lumine wears a pale white sleeveless dress with blue lines and tail capes, with gloves covering her thumbs. Also, she wears white stockings and boots; Aether wears a dark breastplate vest and black boots, with dark brown pants, a white scarf and a two-tailed cape with golden embroidery and decals.
Certain parts of the Traveler's clothing light up based on the current element they are attuned to. In the opening cutscene, both siblings are seen with glowing white clothing and yellow wings. However, though they retain their glowing white clothes, the sibling has yet to show use of any of the several elements in or out of combat.
In the Archon Quest Chapter I: Act IV - We Will Be Reunited, the Sibling is shown wielding the same white-gold sword as in the opening cutscene, but it now glows with dark energy.

Personality[]
We will be reunited, dear brother. But not here, not now. We will meet at this journey's end... Once the dust has settled. Then you will understand.—Lumine, We Will Be Reunited Trailer[4]
The sibling has a vendetta against the divine after finishing their journey across Teyvat for reasons unknown. They are solely devoted to accomplishing the goals of the Abyss Order regardless of what has to be done to do so. Despite their questionable actions, the sibling still cares for the Traveler, as they express a desire to return home with them after finishing their goals and convinces them to continue their journey across Teyvat to witness the truth themselves rather than forcing their views on them.

Story[]
The twins initially fall to Teyvat while traveling between various worlds after their home world was destroyed. They crash-land and fall unconscious from the meteoric impact.[5]
The Traveler's sibling is the first to awaken, and leaves the yet unconscious Traveler to head to Khaenri'ah.[6] They eventually became seen as a source of hope and strength by the Khaenri'ahn people. Five hundred years before the beginning of Genshin Impact, the sibling witnesses the cataclysm[4] and the Gods destroying Khaenri'ah. They rush back to the site where they had crashed and wake up The Traveler, showing them the destruction being wrought.[4][7]
During the beginning cutscene in Genshin Impact, both siblings are fighting against the Unknown God. Depending on which gender the player chooses, they will have a name attached to them and will become the Traveler. The other sibling (Lumine or Aether) is then attacked by the Unknown God and sealed away in a cube. The Traveler continues to fight, but is subdued and has their powers sealed away. They wander the land until they come across Paimon.[8]
At some point after the cataclysm, the Traveler's sibling woke up and traveled the world of Teyvat with Dainsleif. Near the end of their journey, their sibling realized the "truth of this world" and parted ways with Dainsleif for reasons unknown. Eventually, they encountered Dainsleif's older brother, Vedrfolnir and began to work with them.
During the Archon Quest, Prologue Chapter - Act III, intelligence passed on from Kaeya and background history from Venti reveals that the Abyss Order had recently gained a new leader named the Prince or Princess.[9][10] At this point, while the Traveler does not know who this leader is, the player can conclude that the Prince or Princess is the Traveler's sibling.[11]
In the story teaser trailer We Will Be Reunited, the Traveler's sibling is depicted as Lumine. In it, she is shown traveling through Mondstadt carried by a Ruin Guard and is revealed to be the mastermind behind the Abyssal plot to weaponize the dragon Dvalin. An Abyss Mage refers to her as "Your Highness" and proceeds to tell her about their foiled plan — she is shocked to learn from the Mage that her brother had a major role in foiling their plot. Later, she runs to a cliffside, where she watches her brother fight hilichurls in the grounds of Stormterror's Lair, unbeknownst to him. This same area is revisited by the Traveler and Dainsleif during the World Quest Bough Keeper: Dainsleif in Chapter I: Act IV - Prelude, where the Traveler senses the presence of their sibling in the past through the dandelion they had stepped on centuries ago. It is later revealed that the sibling was once Dainsleif's travel partner, and the two parted ways for reasons unknown.[12]
At some point in the past, the sibling encountered the Aranara race of Sumeru and helped them repair the Varuna Contraption. In thanks, the Aranara named them "Nara Varuna." Before parting with the Aranara, "Varuna" told Araja of another golden-haired human who would visit them in the future and give them even better memories.[13]
In the Archon Quest Chapter I: Act IV - We Will Be Reunited, the Traveler's sibling briefly meets with the Traveler in front of the Defiled Statue after an altercation between the Traveler and an Abyss Herald. There, the sibling asks the Traveler not to stop them or the Abyss. They also reveal the truth of Dainsleif's origins and that the monsters of the Abyss were once the people of Khaenri'ah that had been transformed by a curse. The Traveler tries to persuade them to leave Teyvat and continue their journey together; the sibling agrees to this, but only after their war against the divine is over. The sibling then tells the Traveler to continue traveling Teyvat ,in the hopes that they, too, would eventually see the true nature of the world presided over by the Seven and Celestia. They then leave with the Herald through a portal.
At some point, the sibling visited The Chasm and saw many dead hilichurls who had wandered inside the cavern. There, they discovered a pool of water which repressed the effects of the curse; the hilichurls had been attracted to the water and had gone there to die in peace. Angered and upset by their needless suffering, the sibling authorized the activation of a device that would supposedly amplify the water's effects to the point that the curse would be removed for good, regardless of how likely the plan would be to succeed. If the device worked, the hilichurls would be reverted to their previous forms as humans of Khaenri'ah, but if it failed, it would inflict extreme, needless pain on the hilichurls. The device backfired and it was destroyed by Halfdan with the help of Dainsleif and the Traveler.
In the Archon Quest Chapter III: Act V - Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises, Nahida told the Traveler that while Irminsul and the Fatui considers them a Descender, their sibling was not considered a Descender. This is because Irminsul has records of the sibling, which, according to Nahida, would be impossible unless they belonged to Teyvat. This also contradicts what the Traveler remembers, since they had both come from a world beyond Teyvat according to their memories. Furthermore, while Irminsul has records of the sibling's sudden appearance in Khaenri'ah and their journey through the seven nations of Teyvat, the records suddenly "become fuzzy" near the end of their journey. Nahida concludes that somebody is deliberately obfuscating the sibling's fate from Irminsul for unknown reasons.[14]
In the Archon Quest Interlude Chapter: Act III - Inversion of Genesis, Scaramouche claims that The Jester had lived with the Traveler's sibling for a period of time, when he had served as the royal mage of Khaenri'ah. He also claims that the Jester had told him the Traveler's sibling's only came to Teyvat because "the heavens responded to the summoning."[6]
In the Archon Quest Chapter III: Act VI - Caribert, it is revealed that the sibling had once encountered Chlothar Alberich and witnessed the effects of the gods' curse on the people of Khaenri'ah through Chlothar's son, Caribert, who had been transformed into a hilichurl. After using the Abyssal power imbued into him by the Sinner, Chlothar was able to temporarily reverse the curse and bring Caribert back to sentience. However, Caribert eventually took off his mask and "an immense energy"—the power of the Abyss—knocked the sibling out. When they came to, Chlothar addressed them as the Prince/Princess of Khaenri'ah, who controlled the Abyss and who the Khaenri'ahns once believed would bring "new strength and hope" to their nation.[15] This initially unnerved them—however, over the course of their travels with Dainsleif, they realized that Chlothar had been right all along and joined the Abyss Order as their current leader.
In the Archon Quest Chapter IV: Act VI - Bedtime Story, despite not having acquired the Eye of the Field Tiller, the sibling was somehow able to progress with the Loom of Fate operation, raising concerns from Dainsleif as he also realized that he had a memory of giving the eye to someone. This was a false memory implanted by Caribert, allowing the sibling to infiltrate the ruins where Dainsleif had kept the eye. They were accompanied by a single Abyss Herald: Frost Fall, though the Traveler defeated it. Dainsleif then sent the Traveler away and unsheathed his sword, while the sibling confronted Dainsleif and had a brief scuffle with him, though they noted that he had some hesitation raising his sword against them. After the battle, the sibling rushed into Caribert's consciousness, reuniting with the Traveler. They had a short conversation, where the sibling revealed that they were trying to find the full potential for the Loom of Fate before the Heavenly Principles would awaken, though unsure as to when or how they would do so. The sibling admitted to missing the Traveler, but would not reunite with them until their war against the divine was over. Caribert's memory then began to collapse, and the sibling revealed that they would not recall their conversation and regretfully parted ways with them.[16]

Trivia[]
While both Traveler and their sibling witnessed the fall of Khaenri'ah 500 years prior to the main storyline, it is speculated that the sibling had been conscious for far longer. This is due to the fact the sibling has traveled throughout the world of Teyvat at least once before becoming the current leader of the Abyss.[4]
The color on the outfit of the Traveler that represents their current element has remained unchanged on the sibling's clothing, being bright white. This color was present for both siblings during their battle against the Unknown God in the opening of the story.
The Traveler's Sibling addresses the Traveler as "Aether" or "Lumine" regardless of the name the player chooses for them.
Most official videos and art by HoYoverse that feature the Traveler have Aether fill that role, while Lumine takes the position of their sibling.
