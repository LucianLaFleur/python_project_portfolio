Dialogue[]

Chan Baatjan: Really good food doesn't need to be ranked. There's no need to feel inferior, but no place for arrogance, either.
 True gourmet cuisine?
Chan Baatjan: It seems you are a fellow seeker and lover of the finest cuisine and daintiest of delicacies as well.
Chan Baatjan: I am Chan Baatjan. I won't claim to be the best chef in Yilong Wharf, but I have never disrespected the original flavors of my ingredients and always cooked every dish with great care.
Chan Baatjan: Unfortunately, I do not often cook anymore, but these days am more akin to a very picky wandering gourmand.
Chan Baatjan: Someone who's just busy in the kitchen all day has quite limited influence in the end.
Chan Baatjan: Thus, over the past few years, I've taken in a dozen or so students and taught them everything I know.
Chan Baatjan: Now, some of them have graduated. The owner of Lianfang Dim Sum and the head chef for Jiulue Teahouse were both my prized pupils.
Chan Baatjan: You should try out their creations. May you find the offerings to your taste!
(Obtain  Tea-Smoked Squab ×3)
 Did you run into some kind of trouble?
Chan Baatjan: Thank you for the kind words, my friend.
Chan Baatjan: I'm not in trouble or anything. This is just something that's been on my mind.
Chan Baatjan: Yilong Wharf faces Lumidouce Harbor, and so we receive a lot of merchants from Fontaine. In time, this place has become a melting pot of cultures and cuisines.
Chan Baatjan: Some chefs had never had Fontainian food, and praised it to the high heavens upon first tasting its novelty.
Chan Baatjan: Some chefs grew arrogant, on the other hand, when they saw Fontainian diners loved Liyue's food, so they started claiming that Liyue has the best food anywhere.
 What do you think?
Chan Baatjan: From my perspective, neither is the right approach. You can substitute Fontainian cuisine for that which comes from other nations, and what I said would still stand.
Chan Baatjan: No two people have the same preferences, so there is no single dish that will earn the praise of every single person.
Chan Baatjan: It's the same as in literature. What's the point of fighting for the empty title of "the best"?
Chan Baatjan: As a chef, one should be humble when looking at new dishes, deconstructing them to learn the ingredients and the skills required to cook them.
Chan Baatjan: We should not blindly praise something that wasn't based on local ingredients, or be intentionally conservative, stalling progress thereby.
Chan Baatjan: Of course, these are just empty words. All I can do is point this out to my students, so they will always remember that they're chefs who strive to make better dishes.
Chan Baatjan: They should also communicate with their colleagues, learning new ideas and doing away with bad ones.
 (Leave quietly...)
Chan Baatjan: I have to explain this to people at some point...
