Dialogue[]

Xuanfan: Can you believe it? I caught Captain Beidou's eye!
 Captain Beidou?
Xuanfan: That's right! It happened just as I was starting to think that I should leave the fleet due to my dismay at our lack of results...
Xuanfan: It was at that moment that the "Alcor" passed us by, and I saw Captain Beidou standing at the helm...
Xuanfan: ...And in that moment, our eyes met.
Xuanfan: I just happened to be on her left, and that courage of hers that subdued the seas themselves pierced my heart in one glance.
 Isn't that the side with the eyepatch?
Xuanfan: Yes, of course, but ah, details!
Xuanfan: She truly is great! With but a single look, she was able to save the spent soul of a sorrowful sailor...
 Congratulations.
Xuanfan: Thank you! And thank Captain Beidou for setting my sailor's soul afire once again!
