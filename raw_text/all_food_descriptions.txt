It is worth noting that the full name of this dish is "Glabrous Beans, Fowl Confit, and Smoked Sausage Stew in Cassoulet Casserole with a Side of Marcotte."

Samosa :  A deep-fried snack. The well-stirred filling is wrapped in a thin crust, shaped into a triangle, then fried in a pan until golden brown. Both meat and vegetarian fillings are common, so the dish has become a point of conflict for those with a strong preference for one over the other.
