Golden Sandstrider is Sethos's Default Character Outfit.
Sethos wears a white top with golden seams as well as black pants, down to roughly his calves, with details in dark blue, purple, and golden shapes. He has boots which have black towards the front and cream color towards the back. His boots adorn golden soles, tips, and hourglass-shaped additions.
There are several accessories Sethos wears in addition to his base of clothing. Upon his waist is a deep purple cloth where his Electro Vision rests, while over his shoulders, Sethos wears a scarf-like cloth wrapped around his shoulders. Over his shoulders, the cloth is a sandy gold sporting purple and lighter gold shapes, with an hourglass design hanging off the tip. Another hourglass shape is in the front, keeping the cloth wrapped around him. Sethos's hands and forearms are covered in dark purple fingerless gloves with golden rims. A golden armband is seen on his left bicep while his right ear wears green earrings. Many of the hourglass-like details upon Sethos closely resemble a certain Ba Fragment.[1][2]

A mysterious desert youth with a friendly smile who loves traveling by foot across both rainforest and desert.—Description from the Official Website[1]
The Temple of Silence's heir. Burdened with secrets, he comes from the sands.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
To the common person, Sethos appears down-to-earth and laid back.[2] As the leader of the Temple of Silence, he proves himself to take his job as seriously as possible. Sethos finds himself to be a people person who enjoys completing menial tasks to help those in need. He is known to never say "no" to simple requests. Wherever he goes, he seems to reference and find friends in every corner. While he prefers to stay out of the spotlight and simply lead a humble life among commoners, he doesn't hesitate to tell tales or go out of his for others expecting no payment.
Sethos can be described by his confidence and sociability. Skilled in the desert's rough terrain, talkative, and enthusiastic, he leaves a lasting impression. Despite being so talkative, he is also particularly skilled in keeping secrets. While taking his duties to heart, Sethos will keep the secrets of the Temple of Silence safe in his care.[3] When reminded of his adoptive grandfather, Bamoun, he tends to be quite sentimental. Sethos cares little about things such as drama or the views that he deems out-of-date, he much rather prefers to move on than question things that may never make full sense.[4] To him, whether a simple researcher or Bamoun himself, people seem to be far too fixated and stubborn to change their views.
Sethos uses the medium male model. Sethos has honey-toned skin and green eyes which sport yellow flecks. His hair is tied back into a long and messy dark brown ponytail with pale braids down to his lower back.
Visitor from the Sea of Sand, Profound Providence
"You shall have the dexterity of the fox and the agility of the flying serpent. The wisdom of Hermanubis shall also bestow its favor upon you. Your name shall be Sethos."—A divination from a Priest during a name-giving ceremony
Inexperienced travelers often find themselves trapped by the vast, boundless sea of sand. Were it not for the timely guidance of a kind soul, their journey of exploration might have come to an untimely end, cruelly cut short. Many of those who were lost and returned to their companions on the road all had the same name upon their lips: Sethos.
A great sense of direction, enthusiastic and talkative... These are all common impressions among those who have been on the receiving end of Sethos's guidance. And it is quite true. As a desert-dweller, Sethos knows the paths between the various oases like the back of his hand, and his mastery of the techniques of navigation — such as using the sun's position to calculate direction — runs even deeper. As a personal interest, Sethos enjoys traveling by foot between desert and rainforest, and the navigational skills he's acquired are a product of his personal experiences doing so. As for being enthusiastic and talkative, by speaking with Eremites chance met on the road or listening to the fascinating anecdotes of hapless scholars rescued from swamp and marsh, not only can he broaden his knowledge and horizons, but also have a lot of fun. For Sethos, that is where the joy of the journey lies.
Perhaps it is because of this personality of his, but regardless of locale, from desert to rainforest, he always has those he can regard as friends. One researcher he met at Caravan Ribat, who had developed a deep admiration for Sethos after being struck by his distinctive understanding of the Akademiya and its knowledge system, once even went so far as to suggest that Sethos sit the Akademiya's entrance exam.
"Be a student at the Akademiya? It would be pretty fun to see how the Akademiya's teachings differ from what the old folks say back home. I'll consider it."
A new face appeared in town, though none can recall when he first showed up.The young man from the desert would show up at any occasion he was inclined to attend with a bearing so confident and natural that many only realized quite some time later that the person they had spoken with earlier was, in fact, a newcomer. After much asking around, they finally found out his name: Sethos."So, where did you meet again? He's an old friend of yours, right?" People would ask each other such questions, before discovering to their surprise that none of them had known him for long.Like a grain of sand blown over the high city walls by some wild desert wind, Sethos blended into the crowd with ease, speaking with them of homelands and travels. People warmed to him immediately, for his unforgettable green eyes and way with words led them to believe he would make a good friend indeed.As the sun set, their new friend would regale them with the tale of how he and a group of Eremites had led Sumpter Beasts away from a sandstorm, setting up camp by an oasis to pass the night; of the desert night's bitter cold, and the euphoria of daybreak that made it all worth enduring.In Sethos's telling, suffering is merely another kind of experience, and all experiences can become stories; and the fonder people grew of his stories, the more they looked forward to seeing him.But one time, when his audience had collapsed on the tables in a drunken stupor, the still-sober Sethos was left sitting there spinning his cup.This is what he said:"All of you are always saying I seem too ordinary in my stories. So how about this for a change... In this one, I am the protagonist, and with me I carry a golden key, which I may use at any moment to open a long-lost treasure trove and lead the people to a place of great mystery. There's no way you'd actually prefer a story like that, right?""If you ask me, that kind of story is just boring. Stories of extraordinary things happening to ordinary people... those are the ones worth telling! Besides, even if mysterious, special individuals like that did exist, they wouldn't be as young as you." The tavern's owner just couldn't stop himself from interjecting."Exactly," replied Sethos, who for some reason looked particularly happy.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Few city dwellers have ever seen Sethos running at full tilt. Had they, they would know that this was a young man who could run like no other; any who wished to keep up with him would have to run as fast as the wind.Sethos himself is very proud of this, and often remarks: "You're gonna need some special skills if you want to survive in the desert, right? Mine's running, and running fast."Thanks to his fleetness of foot, those around him often entrust him with important errands — though strictly speaking, these aren't actual jobs, not even of the part-time variety. Things like delivering letters for bedridden elderly folks, or fetching homework for forgetful students who left it at home.He is repaid in all sorts of different ways. Some students give Mora and others buy him coffee, while others still have offered up their treasured Genius Invokation TCG cards as a token of their heartfelt appreciation.As for the older folks, their gifts have always been... more unique, shall we say. Aside from money, some even treat Sethos to a home-cooked meal, or dig up some old ornament to present to him as a gift.But the easy-going Sethos always accepts everything he is given. He adds it all to his collection, which he sorts by value: Mora, ornaments, useless odds and ends, Genius Invokation TCG cards, and everything else.A woman on Treasures Street once asked him, "You never say no to any task! Don't tell me you actually enjoy running errands?"Sethos loved eating the fried fish rolls she made. Apparently, aside from her own family and neighbors, the helpful Sethos, who lent a hand to her shop, was the only one on the entire street who had ever had the pleasure of tasting that delectable delicacy.Holding the meal box she'd just given him, Sethos stood there for quite some time, thinking the question through."Huh, you're right," he finally said, as if something had just dawned upon him. "Come to think of it, I really do enjoy running errands.""You don't want a better line of work? You seem to know a lot, and you're pretty capable, too... If you'd like, I could help you find a job?" The woman sounded very concerned for him.Sethos simply waved his hand and pointed at a figure that was flying past in the distance. "What do you think that person's doing?"The woman looked up and saw a large, round object sailing by, with what appeared to be a person beneath it. In a tone of surprise, she replied, "Isn't that another errand-runner?""That's Hat Guy, a student from Vahumana who's known for his speed," said Sethos, raising his fork. "But I've heard that sometimes, he also gets called on to deliver letters for the Akademiya.""Do you mean that... that's just what he likes to do?""No, no, I don't think he likes it, but I'm not like him. I'm a people person, and I enjoy running errands and taking on the easy tasks. And look, you even treated me to a meal! Besides, I've got a proper job too, so don't worry about me."Over the next few days, Sethos was busy with his own affairs. One day, as he passed by the side gate of the Akademiya to handle something, he suddenly heard a voice jeering at him from the treetops: "The errand-boy's come running all the way to the Akademiya. Quite the busy little bee, aren't you?"Perched up there on the branch was none other than Hat Guy himself. Smiling back, Sethos raised the lunchbox in his hand and smiled at him, saying, "I'm just here for lunch — someone gave me this. Want some?""I'd say you're no errand boy at all. You've got a more important role.""I'd say that you're no student either. You've got a more important role."Sometimes, a few words are all it takes. Without another word, Hat Guy tugged the brim of his hat and vanished in an instant. As for who Sethos really was, or what this "important role" of his was... Well, there was no one around to hear their little exchange anyway, let alone care.Sethos took his time finding a spot with a good view where he could sit down and enjoy this free lunch of his, which he'd received for a multitude of reasons. Having the chance to meet all these different people, and receive all these gifts in return... He was quite satisfied that this was all thanks to his running ability.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
There was no way Sethos's drunken companions could ever have remembered the great hero he'd referred to in his story, the mysterious figure who held the key to a treasure trove. The only one who did was the owner Lambad, who would say to his tavern's customers: "It's the storyteller's own words! Do you think something like that's really possible?"Most of those confronted with such questions could do little more than stare blankly at one another. Dori picked up her fork, complete with fish roll spiked on its tines, muttering: "If it was, he'd be rich by now.""Perhaps he's already become the leader of a tribe? Stories like that are those of the desert," rejoined Candace, who was sitting at the next table.Dehya, however, laughed, as the thought of someone sprang into her mind. Turning to Lambad, she quietly asked: "And why not? You don't have to be old to have a mysterious background. Who knows, maybe they'd even be the type to drink here, and they'd even have to find a day job, too."At this very moment, Sethos was somewhere far, far away. His footsteps were light, despite the pack he was carrying. On the horizon, the sun was slowly sinking, the shadow of night rising through the distant sky. Seeing that the day was nearly spent, a look of fear was writ large upon the face of the Vahumana researcher he was traveling with. Looking at his employer, Sethos handed him some a flask of drinking water without saying a word.Sethos had considerately slowed down to a fraction of his usual pace so that the researcher would not fall behind. At night, employer and guide shared a single large tent. As Sethos set up the tent, the researcher sat warming himself by the fire Sethos had built, a look of gratitude spread over his face."You don't seem like you want for money. Why are you willing to guide people like me through the desert? You look like you've lived in the desert for quite some time, too.""I had the time, and you needed the help, so I came along. I grew up in the desert, so I couldn't get into the Akademiya myself, and besides, I'm curious about what you're researching. So for me, serving as a guide and a guard for researchers is a chance to hear interesting new things."Sethos's expression was calm and composed, just as it was whenever he told stories, exposing nothing — and he looked quite sincere too. Faced with such sincerity, it was difficult for the researcher to refuse, so he began to recount some entertaining anecdotes about the Akademiya, with complaints about his classmates, colleagues, and research mixed in. Resting his chin on his palm, Sethos sat there listening intently, seemingly fascinated with the researcher's life.Over the next week, Sethos accompanied this little-known researcher as he completed his investigation, then seeing him safely back to the Akademiya. When the researcher handed over the payment, Sethos pocketed the money without so much as checking the amount, then walked back out of the entrance with a wave.As he did so, he just so happened to run into the General Mahamatra. As he looked at Sethos, and then at the now-distant researcher, Cyno knew exactly what had transpired."How's your side-gig going? Do you find their work interesting?" asked Cyno.Following Cyno's lead, Sethos leaned against the railing and gazed out onto the sunset."It was alright. But these scholars are just so stubborn. He kept insisting that there must be a tribe of sages living in seclusion out there in the desert. I told him there was no way they'd be living next to the Mausoleum of King Deshret, but he just wouldn't believe me. In the end, I told him that the place I grew up was just like that, but he didn't believe that either.""Tell him that Tighnari, Collei, Dehya, and myself can all vouch for the fact that you are, in fact, from that kind of place."Sethos sighed. "Then he'd just think me a liar. People from 'places like that' aren't the type who have time for guide work."Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
In Sumeru, both scholars who study King Deshret's civilization and those followers of his who can recite the names of Al-Ahmar and his Seven Pillars by heart know the significance of the "Temple of Silence."It is an extremely ancient organization, and if people knew of its mission, they would sum it up with two words: "sublime" and "stewardship."It has been over a thousand years since Hermanubis, the greatest of all sages, established the Temple of Silence. Their sole aim is one that is also truly sublime, and that is to steward the knowledge that should not find its way out into the world. Over the long centuries, the desert has experienced great turmoil. The Temple of Silence has fled from the devastation of war, taking with them all the knowledge they possessed as they moved from place to place. For a time, they came to the rainforest and worked with the Akademiya, but as they could not trust those wielding power in the Akademiya, they left. Finally, they found a place for themselves in a forgotten corner of the world.Sethos, the one who tells this story, is himself from the Temple of Silence. Despite his claims to be ordinary, he is anything but. Or perhaps an ordinary identity is how Sethos wishes to make up for his own life.Sethos was born in the desert. His mother is said to have been a merchant, and his father a mercenary, and a number of clues have led some to conjecture that they must originally have come from a desert tribe with a tiny population. But alas, it is unfortunate that Sethos has no memory of his birth parents. As far back as he can remember, he was already in the care of Bamoun, living in the Temple of Silence as his adoptive grandson.After some years, it was discovered that Sethos's special constitution was capable of receiving a Ba fragment of Hermanubis. As a result of this, he was indwelt by a great power with which he established a sacred connection.The other whose childhood experiences were similar to his — Cyno, the General Mahamatra — had long gained the admiration of Sumeru's people. But Sethos didn't want to become a famed, high-profile figure like Cyno. Therefore, after arriving in Sumeru City, he chose to live in anonymity, assuming the most ordinary of ordinary identities.He found a place to live and invented a perfectly normal and reasonable-sounding family background for himself. Sometimes, he serves as a desert guide, while others, he helps merchant caravans with this and that. When he is bored, he can be found in various locales, chatting with friends to pass the time.Of course, that is when he is free; things are very different when he is busy. Lesser Lord Kusanali sometimes invites him to meet with the sages to discuss various issues that arise as they work together — for Sethos has now succeeded Bamoun as the leader of the Temple of Silence, and under his leadership, the Temple has once again established a collaborative relationship with the Akademiya.On the one hand, a perfectly ordinary new resident of Sumeru City; on the other, the new leader of the Temple of Silence. Both of these identities are his, despite the apparent gulf between them.If you were to ask him which life he preferred, however, rather than choosing between them, he would simply reply: "Ah, come on now, there's no need for that! Making unnecessary choices is such a tiring way to live! Think about it, you wouldn't force someone to choose between a bottle of liquor and a cup of coffee, would you? Aren't they both me?"Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Bamoun, the previous leader of the Temple of Silence, had been called the "Bearer of Bloodshed." Where this title came from, Sethos neither knows, nor particularly cares.Growing up as one of its members, Sethos had a very particular perspective on the Temple of Silence, one that was the opposite of that of an ordinary child. It took him many years to understand what the Temple of Silence meant for the world.As the leader of such an organization, how heavy was the burden that Bamoun had borne? Sethos believed he knew, yet still found it difficult to imagine.The Bamoun that Sethos remembers is not the stern, upright leader, but rather the kind, patient grandfather. When Bamoun still had his health, he would often take Sethos into the desert.Camping, exploring, hunting... if it was fun, they did it; and it was during this period of his life that Sethos learned how to cook, navigate, and set up camp, all thanks to his grandfather's patient guidance.At that time, Sethos was a very mischievous child. He would spend his time endlessly running around chasing tumbleweed, determined to discover whatever it was that they contained. During the daytime, Bamoun would let him run wherever he wanted; but when the sun began to set, he would personally come to fetch him, leading him back to their tent where Bamoun would sit reading through some abstruse books or documents.Sethos would crouch by his side, sneaking furtive glances at whatever he was reading. Seeing this, Bamoun would say: "You don't have to pretend you're not looking, you know. This isn't some kind of rare ancient text. You don't think I'd actually bring something like that out here with us, do you?"The ancient texts cared for by the Temple of Silence are of the utmost importance, and even the leader cannot remove them without good cause. Most of the books that Bamoun brought with him were from his personal collection, while others he purchased from desert merchants.Grandfather and grandson would huddle together, reading through the texts one word at a time. When Sethos could not understand, he would sit there scribbling silently away in the sand, writing out riddles he had read about or proverbs that others had told him from memory.One time, he asked Bamoun: "What's a rabbit?"Bamoun replied: "The prey of beasts; the nemesis of hay."He followed this up with: "What's a flying serpent then?"Bamoun chuckled for a moment, then replied, "It is a creature who blessed you. The priest said that you would have the dexterity of the fox and the agility of the flying serpent."After night had passed and not long after dawn, Sethos would arrive at the top of the hill with the various weapons that he was carrying. In this place, he would hone his combat skills — first ranged, then melee. Archery was taught by several other figures; but it was Bamoun himself who taught him how to fight with a polearm.Sethos asked Bamoun: "Is this your favorite weapon, Grandpa?"Bamoun replied: "It is the one for which I am best suited. The polearm is the hallmark of a skilled warrior and the emblem of the brave. Even Cyrus fought with a polearm, though whether he may be considered a brave warrior... That is another question."Sethos did not wait to hear what his grandfather might say about that, but he could tell from his expression that he did not think Cyrus was a coward. In fact, that was precisely why he hesitated.Later, Sethos acquired a polearm of his own. Interestingly, it was clear at a glance that it had not been made by any desert dweller. Bamoun did not tell him where it had originally come from, saying only that it had been left behind by Cyrus, and that as it was a fine weapon, no harm in putting it to use.Sethos was sharp enough that from then on, he had a vague sense of the deeper meaning behind Bamoun's words.There were many times when he had thought to himself: Did Bamoun really hate Cyrus? But perhaps his apparent distaste was simply a way of complaining about the fact that his friend had left. If you actually hated someone, you wouldn't hold on to their old possessions. Yet from the ordinary way that Bamoun had brought out and presented him with the polearm, you would have thought that there was nothing special about it at all.What the Temple of Silence needed was what Bamoun needed; yet Bamoun's feelings were his own, and were not those of the Temple. As its leader, it was only right that he should hate someone like Cyrus. But as a friend, perhaps he was glad that Cyrus had shown the courage that he had.Such contradictions would not, and could not, persist indefinitely. There would inevitably come a day when his grandfather would find some way of resolving his little differences with the Temple.Trimming down branches to help the tree keep growing — that was the type of person Bamoun was. Yet even if he would always remain that kind, patient figure in Sethos's heart, he still carried the burden of bloodshed.The next person Bamoun sacrificed would be himself. Sethos understood that Bamoun too knew his grandson would figure this out sooner or later.Thus did grandfather and grandson reach a silent understanding — that a day would come when they would no longer be an ordinary grandfather and adoptive grandson, but instead two individuals standing at the crossroads of history.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
On many nights, Sethos's stories return to the same word: "Friend.""Friends" appear in all corners of his stories, each varying in appearance, age, gender, and identity. Sethos never mentions them by name, saying only that: "My friends are all good people. Without them, it's hard to exaggerate how dull my life would be."The General Mahamatra Cyno might be considered to be Sethos's first friend. Strictly speaking, they've known each other for a very long time indeed. Sethos had already spoken to him during those years when Cyno was still with the Temple of Silence. Later on, the two of them underwent the same test, having Ba fragments implanted and losing a portion of their memories as a result. Cyno's reaction was much more severe, causing him to almost completely forget that he had ever lived at the Temple of Silence; whereas Sethos had not been so badly affected, losing only some memories related to people.He couldn't tell you exactly what he'd forgotten. Perhaps his birth parents, or the faces of his childhood friends. Fortunately, with the exception of Cyno, all of his childhood friends lived at the Temple of Silence, so learning what they looked like again wasn't difficult. And despite the fact that they had forgotten each other, he and Cyno were later to meet again, after which they struck up a true friendship. This pleased Sethos very much, who likes to call Cyno his "bro."After Sethos left the desert, his "bro" Cyno's close friend Tighnari also became an important friend of his. Living in Avidya Forest, this Tighnarian Forest Watcher had an endless stock of stories about the forest, its plants, and the people who would get lost in it. Coming from the desert, where such greenery was practically nonexistent, Sethos was full of curiosity about Tighnari's life and work. Sometimes, he and Cyno would go over to Tighnari's place to mooch a meal, and he'd even compete with Collei to see who was better at setting up a camp.Not long after, he also made friends with the reliable mercenary Dehya, as well as Candace, the Guardian of Aaru Village. Candace even invited Sethos to visit Aaru Village, telling the residents that he was a "traveler" from the heart of the desert.Seeing his bemused look, Candace replied, "You're so busy, rushing here and there every day, so I thought that was the best way to describe you. It must be a wonderful way to live, able to walk on your chosen path..."It was a still, cloudless day when Sethos returned to the Temple of Silence.He assigned matters that needed to be addressed to those there, and he had also brought back many rainforest specialties to share with his people. Among the members of the Temple of Silence, there were many who had never been to the rainforest, so it was a real treat for them to see such unfamiliar things.Once official matters had been settled, Sethos got out his old waterskin, his favorite lyre, and a leaf from Avidya Forest, then set off. He spent that night by the fire he lit beside Bamoun's tomb.He was not sad, nor was he confused — he simply wanted to return to the place where his grandfather had raised him. Being by Bamoun's side gave him an unparalleled sense of calm."My friend picked this leaf for me. There's nothing special about it, really. I just thought it looked beautiful, and I wanted to show you.""Oh yeah, and another friend called me a 'traveler.' What do you think about that, Grandpa? Whenever you claimed to be a traveler, everyone used to say you hadn't been to enough places. But now I have. Plus, I have plenty of free time, so I guess that makes me more of a traveler than you ever were."With this, he threw the leaf into the fire. The flames leapt up for a moment, almost as if a hand were gently waving back at him.With a smile, Sethos gave the firewood a prod and smiled. "Excellent, I'll take that as a yes."Old Waterskin Friendship Lv. 4
An old waterskin made from animal hide. It is older, in fact, than its owner. Sethos treasures it greatly and always has it by his side.It was a gift he received from his grandfather. It is said that some tribes reward their warriors with high-quality waterskins. Though Bamoun did not say it to Sethos in so many words, he gave it to him after the latter shot a faraway bird out of the sky while it was in mid-flight.The strap of the waterskin bears his name, engraved by his grandfather's own hands.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
Normally, a hunt only begins in the wake of a disaster. But sometimes, there are exceptions.Due to a companion's mistake, Sethos, Bamoun, and two other members of the Temple of Silence found themselves surrounded by wild beasts. They fought the pack for an entire night, managing to slay several of their number just before dawn.In this encounter, Sethos fought with energy and courage. He knew that Bamoun, being advanced in years and having previously sustained injuries in various battles in the past, was no longer up to the task of taking charge of battles out in the wilds. So as the sun rose on the second day, the first arrow to pierce a beast's skull came from the bow of Sethos.But his arrows, tearing through the swift wind like drops of water falling into a pan of hot oil, simply ignited a fresh round of even fiercer fighting.Yet in the space of a moment, the ground suddenly began to shift. The beasts, who were focused on hunting down their human prey, failed to notice; and by the time they did, they were already caught in the quicksand, several being swallowed up in an instant.Sethos led the others to higher ground, using a rope and other tools to climb up to the highest nearby point as swiftly as they could. Of course, the beasts that had not yet been engulfed by the quicksand discovered this refuge too, and threw themselves at it, only to be shot down one by one by Sethos's arrows.After a moment of chaos, the surviving beasts fled, and the surviving people breathed a sigh of relief. But at that very moment, a storm bore down upon them, and within a short while, it hit them with its full force.In the raging wind, Sethos could barely keep hold of the three others. In desperation, he tied the rope around their waists, tethered the other end to himself, and clung to the back of the rocky mountainside with all his strength.He knew not how long it took, but the roaring sound of the wind finally came to a stop. Holding on as tightly as he could, Sethos slowly pulled the others back to his side.After observing the weather to ensure it was safe, they returned the way they had come. Along the way, Sethos spotted two more beasts — one large, one small — lying dead at the bottom of a cliff.Looking at them from a distance, Bamoun remarked, "Most likely a parent and a child. The larger one was probably chasing the smaller one, trying to drag it back, before it too lost its footing and they were blown down together.""They were with that pack of beasts just now... But weren't there quite a few smaller ones? This large one died trying to save just a single one, and now the other small ones will be left unprotected. The losses far outweigh the gains... It shouldn't have taken the risk," said one of the other members, shaking their head.Trying to rescue your children first from quicksand, then a storm... It sounded like an almost impossible task. Sethos had noticed, though, that Bamoun had been staring at that spot the whole time, as if it had reminded him of something. But in the end he said nothing more.Having survived the disaster, the group slowly departed, with Sethos bringing up the rear. Before leaving, Sethos glanced back down at the scene below to regard the unsuccessful beast one last time.Having just experienced a genuine life-or-death situation, he now felt an additional weight in his pocket — a Vision. But in moments like that, the chain of events that led up to it happening seemed irrelevant; sometimes, the only thing people could see was the end result.Sethos gripped the Vision tightly through the fabric of his pocket, reflecting calmly yet deeply upon this truth.

I have heard his tale, of Hermanubis's glory dwelling within a worthy vessel. I also understand he has been active in Sumeru City recently? Apparently, he has spoken to Cyno and other friends of his plans to visit Aaru Village. I look forward to hosting him.CynoAbout Sethos Media:VO_Cyno About Sethos.ogg Media:VO ZH_Cyno About Sethos.ogg Media:VO JA_Cyno About Sethos.ogg Media:VO KO_Cyno About Sethos.ogg Sethos has a strong sense of responsibility. I have the utmost respect for his skill as a warrior, and I admire his courage. He's also been a great help to me personally, and I'm sure that cooperation between the Akademiya and the Temple of Silence will go very smoothly with him leading the Temple.Nevertheless, he does have one flaw — he doesn't play nearly enough Genius Invokation TCG for my liking. Every time I invite him to play, he's either busy with work, about to go out for a meal, or has existing plans with other friends... Excuses, all of them! Are we not his best friends in all of Sumeru City?DehyaAbout Sethos Media:VO_Dehya About Sethos.ogg Media:VO ZH_Dehya About Sethos.ogg Media:VO JA_Dehya About Sethos.ogg Media:VO KO_Dehya About Sethos.ogg Oh yeah, I only found out about him being from the Temple of Silence recently, too. Ahh, sorry, no — I'm no expert in mysterious organizations like that. Seen him a few times in the desert though. He's very down-to-earth. Once when my guys got into some trouble in the desert, he was kind enough to share his drinking water with them. Nice guy.FaruzanAbout Sethos Media:VO_Faruzan About Sethos.ogg Media:VO ZH_Faruzan About Sethos.ogg Media:VO JA_Faruzan About Sethos.ogg Media:VO KO_Faruzan About Sethos.ogg Oh? You mean the new arrival? Yes, didn't he show up at the perfect time! I still don't know which Darshan he belongs to, but I seem to run into him all the time these days: out on the streets, in shops, at restaurants... It's like he's everywhere at once. The way he nods his head when he talks, it's like... oh, I don't know, like... a little puppy, yes. Eloquent young fellow, too. Seems like a good egg. Anyway, are you acquainted with him? You must encourage him to enroll in my classes. Tell him Madam Faruzan will take good care of him.TighnariAbout Sethos Media:VO_Tighnari About Sethos.ogg Media:VO ZH_Tighnari About Sethos.ogg Media:VO JA_Tighnari About Sethos.ogg Media:VO KO_Tighnari About Sethos.ogg Sethos? Pretty interesting guy. He's like a distant cousin of Cyno's. Really easy to get along with. Last time he visited us in Gandharva Ville, he insisted on showing off his tent-pitching skills and had a fishing competition with Cyno. Collei got really upset, because she thought there was nothing for her to do anymore...People say Sethos is good at keeping himself amused — he certainly seems pretty cheerful. But he takes his work very seriously. Hmm, although I don't know how accurate "work" is — I think he sees his role at the Temple of Silence as more of a kind of duty. Anyway, if you ever find yourself needing assistance in the desert, I'm sure he'd be a good person to go to.WandererAbout Sethos Media:VO_Wanderer About Sethos.ogg Media:VO ZH_Wanderer About Sethos.ogg Media:VO JA_Wanderer About Sethos.ogg Media:VO KO_Wanderer About Sethos.ogg What makes you think I know him? The fact that he's always following me around and asking for a closer look at my hat? We've barely spoken before. The first time we met, he came up and asked me if I was Hat Guy... Last time I checked, judging someone by their appearance is superficial. Hmph, somehow, everyone knows the name "Hat Guy" now...

Hello, hello, I'm Sethos. What can I do for you? ...Actually, you know what? This seems like more of a sit-down conversation. Come with me, I know a good place.

When It RainsWhen It RainsMedia:VO_Sethos When It Rains.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_When_It_Rains.ogg No umbrella for me, thanks. It hardly ever rains in the desert, so I'm gonna enjoy this while I can.
When Thunder StrikesWhen Thunder StrikesMedia:VO_Sethos When Thunder Strikes.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_When_Thunder_Strikes.ogg No no no... Quick, let's get to lower ground!
When It SnowsWhen It SnowsMedia:VO_Sethos When It Snows.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_When_It_Snows.ogg *shudder* ...Quick quick quick, let's pick up the pace! Jogging will warm us up!
When the Sun Is OutWhen the Sun Is OutMedia:VO_Sethos When the Sun Is Out.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_When_the_Sun_Is_Out.ogg The weather's so perfect, it would be such a waste not to go camping. How does fishing in an oasis sound?
In the DesertIn the DesertMedia:VO_Sethos In the Desert.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_In_the_Desert.ogg Have you ever tried drawing in the sand? From up high, it makes for an incredible sight! But you need to pick somewhere less exposed to the wind.
Good MorningGood MorningMedia:VO_Sethos Good Morning.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_Good_Morning.ogg Goooood morning, wanna join me for breakfast? I'm gonna fix some Shawarma Wraps — I've been craving them since last night.
Good AfternoonGood AfternoonMedia:VO_Sethos Good Afternoon.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_Good_Afternoon.ogg It's tempting to have a coffee at this hour, but it'll ruin your afternoon nap.
Good EveningGood EveningMedia:VO_Sethos Good Evening.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_Good_Evening.ogg The desert's a pretty lifeless place during the day, but you can't beat the view of the stars at night.

About Sethos: ImpressionAbout Sethos: ImpressionMedia:VO_Sethos About Sethos - Impression.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_About_Sethos_-_Impression.ogg Some of my elders say I'm difficult to control, like a wild animal. I actually don't disagree with that, but don't you think it's kind of an issue that they'd want to control how other people think in the first place?
About Sethos: Leadership Friendship Lv. 4 OathkeeperAbout Sethos: Leadership Friendship Lv. 4 OathkeeperMedia:VO_Sethos About Sethos - Leadership.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_About_Sethos_-_Leadership.ogg To be honest, being a leader is a little stressful, especially in the Temple of Silence. But after all the years I spent with Grandfather, I'm at least clear in my own mind about the areas where I cannot compromise. After the Rite of Duels, and having been given the chance to make so many new friends, I now know the direction I want to take the Temple of Silence in from here on out. Don't worry — I won't mess it up.
About Us: ChitchatAbout Us: ChitchatMedia:VO_Sethos About Us - Chitchat.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_About_Us_-_Chitchat.ogg When you approach someone while intending to ingratiate yourself with them, it often makes for a stilted conversation. It's much easier to build up a rapport by just hanging out and talking about whatever.
About Us: Bonfire Friendship Lv. 6 OathkeeperAbout Us: Bonfire Friendship Lv. 6 OathkeeperMedia:VO_Sethos About Us - Bonfire.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_About_Us_-_Bonfire.ogg Lighting a bonfire at night keeps you warm and keeps wild animals away. To me, you're just like a bonfire.Too abstract? Alright, let me put it more directly: I think of you as a good friend.
About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Sethos About the Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_About_the_Vision.ogg When desert people receive a Vision, everyone will claim it's a blessing from such-and-such a god, depending on their faith. Watching them get into an argument over someone else's Vision, about who's stronger out of Lord Hermanubis and Lord Sobek, is a guilty pleasure of mine.
Something to ShareSomething to ShareMedia:VO_Sethos Something to Share.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_Something_to_Share.ogg If you're ever traveling in the desert, journeying by night is a good choice. It does get very cold, but you don't get as dehydrated as you would under the harsh sun. Putting on a few extra layers is way easier than spending half your journey time looking for a water source.
Interesting ThingsInteresting ThingsMedia:VO_Sethos Interesting Things.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_Interesting_Things.ogg I don't know where Mourning Flowers got their name, it's quite an evocative image though. Maybe somebody saw one wilting in the sunlight and thought it looked like a person hanging their head in sorrow.
About Cyno Friendship Lv. 4 OathkeeperAbout Cyno Friendship Lv. 4 OathkeeperMedia:VO_Sethos About Cyno.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_About_Cyno.ogg Cyno is truly outstanding — absolutely a worthy heir to Henrmanubis's power. As General Mahamatra, he has the utmost reverence for knowledge and wisdom. If the Akademiya and the Temple of Silence do start working together again, I'll take comfort in the fact that he's there.Oh yeah, and another great thing about Cyno: You know the way he talks? It's just... so funny.
About Tighnari Friendship Lv. 4 OathkeeperAbout Tighnari Friendship Lv. 4 OathkeeperMedia:VO_Sethos About Tighnari.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_About_Tighnari.ogg Tighnari's made of strong stuff. I only found out after the fact that he doesn't cope well with the desert climate — never would've guessed from how he performed in the Rite of Duels. I was also surprised when he sent me a letter inviting me to visit Gandharva Ville, saying it would be a good chance to meet some of Cyno's friends. Are those guys always such a hoot with their jokes? Dinner with them must be hilarious — I can't wait!
About Alhaitham and Kaveh Friendship Lv. 4About Alhaitham and Kaveh Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Sethos About Alhaitham and Kaveh.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_About_Alhaitham_and_Kaveh.ogg I saw those two at the tavern once. And another time at the cafe. ...Actually, I think I saw them once at the Grand Bazaar, too. The architect guy, he's always talking in a hushed tone — I guess he doesn't want people to hear, but uh... Okay, it's not like I purposely listen in, it's just... Something about those two guys hanging out together, you just can't look away.
About the Wanderer Friendship Lv. 4About the Wanderer Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Sethos About the Wanderer.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_About_the_Wanderer.ogg Who is that guy, anyway? A foreign exchange student, or something? He has a pretty incredible hat, never seen anything like it. I tried to get a closer look once, but then I blinked and he was gone. Shame. I won't let him get away next time, though. I also hear he has some pretty interesting ideas... Gotta have a chat with him sometime!
About Dehya Friendship Lv. 4About Dehya Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Sethos About Dehya.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_About_Dehya.ogg Flame-Mane... everyone in the desert knows that name. The Eremites aren't exactly saints, as I'm sure you know, but Dehya's one of the few solid and dependable ones out there. If you ever want to explore the Great Red Sand, Dehya's the second-best guide you could ask for. First-best being me, obviously.
About Candace Friendship Lv. 4About Candace Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Sethos About Candace.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_About_Candace.ogg Have you ever experienced Candace's hospitality? She cooks very generous portions — even I could barely finish. So long as you're on the receiving end of her hospitality and not her wrath, you'll live a long and happy life.
About Faruzan Friendship Lv. 4About Faruzan Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Sethos About Faruzan.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_About_Faruzan.ogg It's so rare to meet someone even more chummy than me! One minute I was taking a stroll near the Akademiya, the next minute she'd taken me on as a student, and was insisting on giving me a tour. She gave me a real fright, though, because she said that if I joined Haravatat, I'd get the 20-tongues language-learning package, mastery of all 100% guaranteed... I asked around, and it seems like that's just an in-joke among Akademiya students — there is no 20-language graduation requirement after all. But I don't get it... how is that funny? It's only gonna put people off studying there.
About Nilou Friendship Lv. 4About Nilou Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Sethos About Nilou.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_About_Nilou.ogg I usually can't stay still for more than a few minutes, but Zubayr Theater is one place I don't mind just standing and watching while Nilou dances on the stage. It's a rare skill to be able to bring people such a sense of peace.

Well, I'm an unemployed vagrant, obviously. I wouldn't have the time to be such a handyman otherwise, would I?
More About Sethos: III Friendship Lv. 4More About Sethos: III Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Sethos More About Sethos - 03.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_More_About_Sethos_-_03.ogg I like going on hiking trips. I always map out my route, pack a bag, and pick a good day. I enjoy having it all carefully planned out. Of course, you gotta leave some flexibility in your schedule, too — you might make a new friend along the way.
More About Sethos: IV Friendship Lv. 5More About Sethos: IV Friendship Lv. 5Media:VO_Sethos More About Sethos - 04.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_More_About_Sethos_-_04.ogg I always have a great time at the Grand Bazaar. I like to pick a bunch of different herbs and spices to mix with some freshly grilled meat. I never make a note of the exact combination of ingredients though, so I usually end up with one-off recipes. What do you think? Any interest in trying one of my limited-edition, one-time-only delicacies?
More About Sethos: V Friendship Lv. 6 OathkeeperMore About Sethos: V Friendship Lv. 6 OathkeeperMedia:VO_Sethos More About Sethos - 05.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_More_About_Sethos_-_05.ogg I've lived in the Temple of Silence for as long as I can remember, and to be honest, I've never had many of my own decisions to make. I'm still not sure if withstanding the power of Hermanubis was a blessing or a curse, but it definitely gave me a higher purpose in life.There's a million things you can regret in life, so I'm just happy I was able to bring that one situation to a close. I'm sure Grandfather will rest in peace knowing that I got to become the leader of the Temple of Silence, and that Hermanubis's power has finally found a home.
Sethos's HobbiesSethos's HobbiesMedia:VO_Sethos Hobbies.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_Hobbies.ogg I get bored when I'm inside for too long. I always like exploring the great outdoors, whatever the weather might be like.
Sethos's TroublesSethos's TroublesMedia:VO_Sethos Troubles.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_Troubles.ogg You have to be fully prepared before you venture out on a trip, especially when you're going somewhere you haven't been before. The first time I spent the night in the rainforest, I didn't realize that I should've brought a waterproof groundsheet... That was a miserable night.
Favorite FoodFavorite FoodMedia:VO_Sethos Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_Favorite_Food.ogg I like mixing spices — but only because it makes meat taste better. It's a means to an end.
Least Favorite FoodLeast Favorite FoodMedia:VO_Sethos Least Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sethos_Least_Favorite_Food.ogg Green vegetables are nice to look at and all, but eating them... Ehh.

How about kicking off the next year of your life with a new hairdo, huh? If you're up for it, just leave it to me. You'll look glamorous, I promise you.

Media:vo sethos mimitomo hello 01.ogg Sethos: Hello, there. It's nice to see you again.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo hello 02.ogg Sethos: Sweet spot you got here. Thanks for inviting me.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Sethos: Sure do! It's great!
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Sethos: I'd like to think I'm a flexible guy who can adapt to any environment, never mind one as pleasant as this.
 Well, the layout is my pride and joy.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship1 03a 1.ogg Sethos: I can tell.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship1 03a 2.ogg Sethos: Some people like to go out and have fun. Others prefer to create a comfy space for themselves at home where they can enjoy some peace and quiet.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship1 03a 3.ogg Sethos: People enjoy life in different ways, but both approaches are equally valid.
 This is rather embarrassing. I've neglected the place lately...
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship1 03b 1.ogg Sethos: No, no, no! Don't say that!
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship1 03b 2.ogg Sethos: I prefer being out adventuring too, so I try to keep things simple at home. But even then, my pad isn't nearly as neat as this.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Sethos: You know, this place is real roomy. There are houses and buildings, sure... But, there's also lots of open space...
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Sethos: You could build a bunch of different areas, each with a unique design. That way, it'd feel like we were camping in a new place every night!
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Sethos: I'd even help out if you wanted!
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship1 07.ogg Sethos: Truth is, I'm fully furnished with ideas as we speak!
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Sethos: Yeah, sure, let's do it! Things were getting quiet around here, y'know?
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Sethos: Just as well. There's something I wanted to ask. In your experience, what preparations would I need to make before visiting a newly excavated desert ruin?
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Sethos: Not yet. This question's purely hypothetical.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Sethos: Most of the members of the Temple of Silence spend their time at our base, researching and watching over our ancient technologies. But, there are times when we must investigate external locations.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Sethos: I try not to miss out on those opportunities.
 I don't go to the desert often. You probably have more experience than me.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 06a 1.ogg Sethos: Really? Was my intel wrong, then?
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 06a 2.ogg Sethos: You know, so much of the desert remains a mystery, even to people who've lived there a long time.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 06a 3.ogg Sethos: Sometimes, we find our path blocked by a bunch of mechanisms before we can even get inside the ruin.
 I know the desert like the back of my hand.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Sethos: Haha, that's the "experienced adventurer" aura I expected. So, are you familiar with the differences in climate between various regions in the desert, too?
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Sethos: Take the area around the Mausoleum of King Deshret, for example.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Sethos: That area has the highest concentration of ruins related to King Deshret. It's also where investigation teams are liable to encounter the most trouble.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Sethos: It looks like nothing more than a swath of empty desert, but it's packed to the gills with invisible walls.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Sethos: We spent enormous amounts of effort to uncover the expanse of the ruins, only to then discover that determining their height was the real issue.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 11.ogg Sethos: Later on, a team member suggested bringing some of that invisible material back with us...
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 12.ogg Sethos: And using it to build an invisible labyrinth around the Temple of Silence to ward off intruders.
 You're not talking about yourself, are you?
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 13.ogg Sethos: Hey, do I seem like that sorta person to you?
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 14.ogg Sethos: But, I'll admit, we were thinking along the same lines.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 15.ogg Sethos: It's just... I wasn't sure our people could navigate a labyrinth like that, so I didn't bring it up.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 16.ogg Sethos: In the end, my concerns turned out to be valid, and we scratched the idea.
 Allow me to thank you on behalf of all adventurers everywhere.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 17.ogg Sethos: Haha, don't mention it!
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship2 18.ogg Sethos: Even if you don't count that labyrinth, I can assure you that the desert's not hurting for mysteries.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Sethos: Oh, you bet I do. A whole list!
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Sethos: But, I didn't want to step on your toes, seeing as this is your place and all.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Sethos: Um, that maybe... we could... build a campsite?
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Sethos: R—Really? Awesome!
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Sethos: Let me see... First, we'll need at least two tents.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Sethos: First one's for resting. We'll put thick cloth up around the walls to keep any noise out.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Sethos: We could even use that one for research or to organize our documents.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Sethos: The other tent will be a space to chat and play games. We can put picnic supplies and chairs near the entrance.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Sethos: The weather here seems pretty nice, so we shouldn't need any rain or wind protection...
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Sethos: Then, I guess the only thing left would be adding some adventure to this place.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Sethos: No matter how beautiful the scenery, standing back and looking at it's gonna get old sometimes.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Sethos: You've got to get out there and enjoy it!
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 13.ogg Sethos: And if there were mechanisms that we could use to jump, run, climb, or glide around this place, that would be the cherry on top!
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 14.ogg Sethos: Install stuff like that, and whoosh! Nothing here would be off-limits.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 15.ogg Sethos: Ah, you mean that little finch with the nice smile?
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 16.ogg Sethos: Perfect! I've actually talked to her already. All that stuff she knows about housekeeping... Super impressive!
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 17.ogg Sethos: I couldn't get her to tell me about all of her contraptions, but I understand. Every organization has its secrets... The Temple of Silence is like that too.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 18.ogg Sethos: Don't worry. I'll find a way.
 Turning this into an amusement park, are we?
 Whatever makes you happy. I've got more than enough space.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 19.ogg Sethos: Perfect! Glad to have your stamp of approval!
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 20.ogg Sethos: Well, I'll get designing, then. I'll let you know when the blueprints are ready.
Media:vo sethos mimitomo friendship3 21.ogg Sethos: You can invite your other friends over once it's done. The more, the merrier!
Media:vo sethos mimitomo morning 01.ogg Sethos: Morning! Today's a new day!
Media:vo sethos mimitomo morning 02.ogg Sethos: Hmm, let me think... Should I scout out a new hiking route or just find somewhere to camp nearby...
Media:vo sethos mimitomo night 01.ogg Sethos: Good night! Hey, you're up pretty late. Still got plans, then?
Media:vo sethos mimitomo night 02.ogg Sethos: I'm not tired either. How about we go out for a bit? If we run into trouble, I'll protect you! Or, you can protect me... whatever works!
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.
Media:vo mimitomo xm sethos grandbazaar 01.ogg Sethos: Whenever I go to the Grand Bazaar, I head straight to the food stalls, grab some snacks and a drink, and then I take my time checking the place out.
Media:vo mimitomo xm sethos grandbazaar 02.ogg Sethos: But, some shops are off-limits if you have your hands full... A carpet shop, for example.
Media:vo mimitomo xm sethos grandbazaar 03.ogg Sethos: How about this... We split the snacks! That way, we can finish them off quickly and then get shopping!
Media:vo mimitomo xm sethos kabobrestaurant 01.ogg Sethos: Wow, wow, wow, you've got yourself a pro-grade grill right there. Temperature, rotation speed... It all looks pitch-perfect!
Media:vo mimitomo xm sethos kabobrestaurant 02.ogg Sethos: Ah, I've got it!
Media:vo mimitomo xm sethos kabobrestaurant 03.ogg Sethos: How about we use these spices, grill up some steaks, and stuff 'em in a wrap?
