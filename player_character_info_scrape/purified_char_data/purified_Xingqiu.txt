He is the second son of the Guild Manager of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, an influential group in Liyue, and is also a self-proclaimed practitioner of the Guhua Clan's arts. Also an avid reader, Xingqiu aims to be the embodiment of chivalry like the heroes from the books he reads; however, this belies his knack for mischief.
Xingqiu's outfit. Fine robes woven from the high-quality silk sold by the Feiyun Commerce Guild.
Unlocked upon obtaining character
Azure Silk is Xingqiu's Default Character Outfit.
Xingqiu wears a blue earring with a gold tassel on his right ear. His Vision is pinned to the bottom of the left side of his coat on top of a span of frilled, white fabric. A tassel made of amber which matches his eyes hangs from his Vision.
His attire consists of a long coat of silk which gradients from black at the collar, to shades of navy blue as the material descends. The coat's underside is a contrasting yellow with a faint, wavy pattern decorating the fabric, alluding to his Hydro vision. His collar and shoulder plates are rimmed with a gold, metallic material and to the right side of his chest sits a large circular brooch. It is embedded with a blue jewel, alike the center of his collar, coat buttons and sleeve cuffs (front and side). Underneath, Xingqiu wears a white long-sleeved shirt with a frilled seam to the right, revealed by the slit of his coat behind two overlapping ribbon-like buttons.
He additionally wields distinct, frilled sleeves which extend from his coat's baggy, gold pair. A clover-like ribbon of white, black and yellow is pinned to the right side of his belt. Beneath this hangs a pair of rectangular ribbons, one in white covering a notably longer, black ribbon. Both of them wield gold decals at their ends. He also wears a pair of navy-blue shorts with ends of black that are mostly concealed by the length of his coat. On his right leg, Xingqiu wears a garter with a blue tassel, just below the knee. His footwear consists of a pair of white high-calf boots, black at the heels and soles with gold motifs.

Formal wear prepared by the Feiyun Commerce Guild for Xingqiu. The bamboo prints are refined and the cut is most flattering, but Xingqiu's favorite aspect of the outfit is its inner pockets, into which a thinner novel might be stuffed.

"What? Meowndering Hero's gone missing!? At this juncture, of all times!?"
The troupe leader's furious voice echoed backstage.
"And right when Feiyun Commerce Guild's having important guests from Fontaine over for an evening banquet? Come on! If we run our reputation into the ground here, it's is going to be disaster for our shows on both shores of the sea!"
The actor playing the "wandering hero," head shrunken back in a panic, looked nothing like the part.
"Th—There's still time before we take the stage. I'll go look for it right now!"
Outside the backstage window, sitting leisurely on a corner eave, was Xingqiu.
"I see, I see. So it is a matter of saving face, then, that no one from our Guild was asked to join the search? That complicates things... How, then, am I to tell them that you're here, Mr. Cat?"
Standing up, Xingqiu peeped down the chimney mouth next to him — within, a black cat in swashbuckling garb stared up at him, eyes vigilant.
To say nothing of his own chicanery in secreting himself away from the banquet making him ill-suited to meet others directly, someone known as the "second young master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild" finding this 'Meowndering Hero' would make things terribly awkward for the opera troupe.
"I guess I'll just have to rescue you and take you backstage in secret, huh... Ugh, I hope I don't get these clothes dirty, or my brother's going to ask some pointed questions about where I've been again..."
Xingqiu reached cautiously into the chimney, but the cat ducked into a corner, rejecting his proffered helping hand.
"Spooked by the unfamiliar environment? Or are you just not fond of the banquet atmosphere? Either way, Mr. Cat, getting others in hot water is not quite what a cat with your title should be doing."
He grinned wryly. No getting this kitty to come along without getting his hands dirty, huh?
The night went as planned, and the troupe took the stage without a hitch.
Meowndering Hero twirled and flipped to the strict rhythm of the gong, seemingly endless applause breaking out.
"Amazing! Most amazing!" Xingqiu exclaimed while grabbing onto his older brother. What grabbed said brother's attention, however, was Xingqiu's new attire.
This Fontainian-style ensemble's well-tailored lines were adorned with elegant bamboo patterns. Clearly, the work of a master...
And yet, when he had first received it, had this little lad not complained that it "restricted movement" and "made it hard to conceal oneself," wearing it but once before folding it up and putting it back on the shelf? Where was this sudden love for it coming from?
As if reading the doubt written on his brother's face, Xingqiu smiled softly, saying: "I came across this line while reading last night: 'One should make guests feel at home'... Changing into these clothes to welcome guests from Fontaine is a form of courtesy too, is it not?"
The doubt knitted into the elder brother's brows dissipated, and he looked Xingqiu up and down once more. His clothes were quite clean, so he certainly didn't seem to have snuck out like he had last year...
Perhaps his kid brother really had matured a little this year, he thought with some relief.
...Still, there was a faint smell of ash in the air. Where was that coming from, exactly?
"No need to trouble yourselves. I'll change by myself."
When the banquet was over, and the servants were sent away, Xingqiu would take his coat off, revealing his dust and dirt-stained inner garments.
"Phew... That was a close one. Good thing this was in the cabinet. There was no way I was fooling my brother otherwise..."
Perhaps his next novel could be about a chivalrous thief from Fontaine, then?
"Hmm... Let's start with this: All know the common wisdom that damasked dress makes a deficient disguise, but none realized that celebrity was the cloak of this chivalrous thief..."
These are heard when equipping the costume.

OverviewLoreVoice-OversOutfitsCompanionGallery
The second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, Xingqiu has had a reputation for being studious and polite ever since he was a young child.But there is another side to the mild-mannered Xingqiu everyone knows. A daring, adventurous and much more mischievous side...—Description from the Official Website[1]
A young man carrying a longsword who is frequently seen at book booths. He has a chivalrous heart and yearns for justice and fairness for all.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
To most people, Xingqiu appears to be a polite young man who takes his studies seriously, but he also has a more mischievous side to him. In the presence of close friends and family, he is gregarious and chatty, but shows more restraint than his elder brother. Unlike his older sibling, who is completely devoted to the guild's success, Xingqiu is more reluctant to do so, putting him at odds with his family.
He is good friends with Hu Tao and Chongyun, though he pranks the latter consistently. He is an avid reader and spends most of his time looking for rare books at Wanwen Bookhouse when he is not preoccupied with his duties, writing his own books from time to time, with "A Legend of Sword" being one of his books. While it did not garner the popularity he wished for in Liyue, he is unexpectedly popular in Inazuma and Fontaine after an Inazuman merchant took the book back home with them; however, Xingqiu was initially unaware of its popularity in Inazuma.[2][3]
Being the second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, Xingqiu is extremely wealthy and possesses a significant amount of influence, although he only resorts to using the guild as backup if the situation cannot be handled otherwise. Wishing to become a real life embodiment of the heroes he reads in stories, Xingqiu has a strong sense of justice and was able to revitalize the Guhua Clan despite being one of its younger members. He despises those who resort to underhanded methods or badmouth chivalrous heroes. Despite his carefree personality, he is also intelligent, capable of rectifying problems in his own unique way and has done so in a manner that people simply give up arguing against him if he gets himself in trouble. He claims that when his older brother takes over, he would have to do all the work for him;[4] likewise, Yanfei has a positive view on him, as she was impressed by how he was able to keep up with her train of thought compared to the rest of his family.[5]

Xingqiu uses the medium male model. He has golden-amber eyes, a light skin tone, and dark navy blue hair with asymmetrical bangs.
Rainbows Only Come After the Rain - Xingqiu
Don't be fooled by his air and graces... He's a prankster to the core!—Chongyun, speaking from firsthand experience
Second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, Xingqiu has had a reputation for being studious and polite ever since he was a young child. Parents in Liyue Harbor would speak adoringly of him, all secretly hoping that their own children would show as much promise as Xingqiu.
But even at a young age, mild-mannered Xingqiu had a wilder side too. Unbeknownst to his father and elder brother, he would sit for hours in the classroom reading fiction, having hollowed out used textbooks and snuck martial arts novels inside. After classes, he'd go out exploring and looking for all sorts of little ways to cause mischief.
Sometimes, his antics would even end up embroiling the Feiyun Commerce Guild in controversy. Luckily for Xingqiu, he always managed avoid blame by hiding behind an insurmountable wall of eloquent filibustering. Since no-one had quite what it took to beat him in an argument, eventually people simply learned to put up with his eccentricities.
An avid reader, Xingqiu's lifelong dream is to be the real-life embodiment of the chivalrous heroes from the pages of his books. For Xingqiu, chivalry is more than a standard of conduct — it's a mindset. The most chivalrous of all are not deterred by setbacks, nor do they stop to indulge their sense of satisfaction when things turn out as hoped. Instead, their minds are focused at all times on seizing the next opportunity to advance the cause of compassion and justice.
Despite his young age, Xingqiu has already mastered the chivalric code and cultivated the eccentric mindset that comes along with it. This gave him a knack for the style of martial arts practiced by the Guhua Clan, and he gained some renown for effectively starting a Guhua renaissance. However, eager devotees who flock to the Guhua Clan's gates in search of the master himself may be disappointed to hear the gatekeeper's awkward response: "The master is off in the mountains taking some time to himself right now... Maybe try again another day."
Every merchant in Liyue Harbor knows of Xingqiu from the Feiyun Commerce Guild.All see him as a kind and well-mannered young man who is an excellent student, a top talent in every sense.As the second-born son of the family, Xingqiu is not required to shoulder the burden of managing the Guild's affairs. However, Xingqiu possesses a unique scholarly talent among his peers — that is, the offspring of Liyue's wealthiest merchants — and was often praised by his tutors as a young student.Xingqiu's elder brother, while learning the family business from their father, firmly believed that Xingqiu would become a great asset to the business one day.However, little did he know that Xingqiu, after finishing the dauntingly thick volumes on commerce and philosophy, would hollow them out and sneak martial art novels into them, which he read incessantly thereafter.Sometimes, Xingqiu suddenly disappears for hours at a time with no explanation. When asked why, he simply replies: "A moment of solitude."Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
To Xingqiu, "a moment of solitude" can mean all sorts of things.Examples include visiting Wanwen Bookhouse to peruse the latest novels and going to Heyu Tea House to sample Yun Jin's latest drink.Sometimes, it means that he is off to fight for justice in the name of chivalry.Defeating bandits on the road, driving away monsters, helping distressed children by fetching their kites from the tree tops... there are all manner of responsibilities that fall into the category of chivalry.Inspired by tropes from his beloved martial arts novels — such as the king who wears a disguise and mingles with the common folk — Xingqiu does not hesitate to leverage the power of the Feiyun Commerce Guild to resolve more complex issues when violence isn't the answer.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
One day, Xingqiu's older brother came looking for him, only to find he wasn't around. When Xingqiu later returned, he came across his brother in the hallway."Your room was a mess, so I cleaned it up. Listen, both you and I are responsible for the reputation of Feiyun Commerce Guild. We have to act the part. If you can't clean up a room, how will you clean up the world? An adeptus once said..."After half an hour of lecturing, Xingqiu was finally let go, but his brother said something strange at the end:"I'll not enter your room without permission next time... I'll make sure the maids do the same."Xingqiu had no idea what he was talking about. However, as his brother turned away, with a despondent look upon his face, he muttered to himself:"Those books under his bed... No. No, I shouldn't go looking at what kind of books they are... Xingqiu is growing up after all... Don't want to be lecturing him all the time... Puberty perhaps?"Afterwards, even Xingqiu found it odd. Expecting that one of the maids would have something to say about the stash of martial arts novels under his bed, he had long since prepared his response, but in the end, no one ever bothered to check his room again.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4  •  Bookworm Swordsman
To keep Xingqiu from spending his whole day at Wanwen Bookhouse in Feiyun Slope, his father agreed to let him learn martial arts from the Guhua Clan. Much to his dismay, Xingqiu quickly discovered that Guhua was a dying art that had been in constant decline for years. There was no proper tuition and it turned out the luxury dojo he had signed up in didn't even belong to the clan — they had just rented it temporarily to keep up appearances.Xingqiu's father was, of course, fully aware of this state of affairs in advance. To him, the whole thing was just for fun. He thought Xingqiu would be content to learn a spot of bladework for show, not for serious self-defense.He hadn't counted on the prodigiously intelligent and extremely well-read Xingqiu being as outstanding a talent in Guhua as he was in every other discipline he had turned his hand to. A combination of his own intuition and extensive knowledge of ancient literature meant he was able to completely revitalize the dead art.Xingqiu was disappointed by Guhua's martial arts program at the beginning, but he found the other tricks they taught to be exactly what he had hoped for.Quicklime, smoking sand, paper fish, sword-swallowing, fire-breathing... Xingqiu was spoilt for choice.He decided on the spot that he would learn them all, no matter how long it would take him. He reasoned that they would be useful to have in his repertoire during his future exploits as a chivalrous hero.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5  •  Bookworm Swordsman
There are two sides to the swashbuckling Xingqiu's personality. While quiet and unassuming in front of strangers, he is gregarious and chatty in the company of close friends and family. Though more restrained than his elder brother, he even has a playful and mischievous side.The one who usually bears the brunt of his bizarre sense of humor is someone named Chongyun, an exorcist usually found on one of the forest trails around Liyue."Chongyun... I found a haunted house for you to practice in...""Chongyun, you have to believe me... It wasn't me who laid the traps inside that haunted house— What? It's not haunted? Well... I, uh, couldn't have known that, could I?""Chongyun... Don't glare at me like that... Look, you're injured. You'd better just lie there and get some rest.""Tell you what, Chongyun, we have a maid who learned the art of essential oil therapy in a nobleman's house in Sumeru... How about I ask her to tend to your wounds? You owe me for this, though..."Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6  •  Bookworm Swordsman
The notion of chivalry means different things to different people.Chivalry means listening to your conscience calling you to action when you see an injustice, right? Or is chivalry simply about knowing right from wrong? No, that's not enough — it must have something to do with being a righteous person...To Xingqiu, chivalry simply means: be good, and do good.As a son of a wealthy merchant in Liyue Harbor, he was born to ride the waves in the world of trade. Notions of chivalry should have gradually left him as he grew up.However, obtaining a Vision changed everything — it meant he was finally able accomplish those legendary deeds he could only dream of as a child.Of course, there is no way he can completely divest himself of his duties in the Guild, but so long as he gets to go out and be the hero even occasionally, he is perfectly content with his life.The only thing that can wipe the smile from Xingqiu's face is when cynics question the true motives of chivalrous heroes.Rank, reputation, reward, shadowy deals... Whenever Xingqiu hears people smearing the names of true heroes, the expression on his face may not change, but he will be sure to add that person to the special section of his blacklist reserved for people he despises even more than carrots."A Legend of Sword" Friendship Lv. 4
Xingqiu once wrote a martial arts novel named "A Legend of Sword" based on his own experiences, intending to publish it in Liyue Harbor.To his surprise, his manuscript was rejected by local publishing houses, who believed that no one would have any interest in a story with "a setting as wildly unrealistic as the plot is banal."Undeterred, Xingqiu had a few copies printed privately, and sneakily placed them on the shelves of Wanwen Bookhouse during one of his many trips there. But just as the publishers had suspected, it failed to garner much interest from readers. This was quite a blow to Xingqiu's confidence.Unbeknownst to him, however, a passing merchant from Inazuma did purchase a copy to bring home, where it received rave reviews. Writers the region over attempted to copy the success of "A Legend of Sword," but none succeeded — it maintains permanent residency in the number one bestseller spot to this day.Vision Friendship Lv. 6  •  Bookworm Swordsman
The martial arts school known as the Guhua Clan has been in decline for several hundred years now. In its heyday, the name of the Clan rang like steel throughout the harbor. It was said that the Clan harbored three great secret arts — the ways of the "Light Piercer" for polearms, "Rain Cutter" for swords, and "Life Ender" for those who excelled in both. The three arts would be refined over the generations, and with time would reach their apex. Yet the Clan's strength would continue to wane, leading to them losing their influence... The three arts became diamonds hidden in the rough, quietly awaiting a successor.After many years, the Guhua Clan would finally get one in Xingqiu. It was he who successfully grasped the ancient "Martial Principle" after merely four years of study.The Guhua weapon arts stress using the weapon as an extension of your body, and indeed this is a common idea amongst the various schools of martial arts in Liyue. But the way Xingqiu saw it, the basis of the polearm and sword was the use of a Vision. Martial artists were meant to see a Vision as an extension of themselves, and see their weapon as an extension of the Vision. Hence, he says: the arts of both the polearm and the sword are just the art of the "eye." Having come to this epiphany, Xingqiu took up a quill and penned a verse on the Martial Principle. Reading it, the Guhua head was shaken with tears, declaring that "it is not Xingqiu who needs the Guhua Clan, but the Guhua Clan that needs Xingqiu." Since then, this verse has been sealed up at the Clan headquarters at Wangshan Hall. Disciples are proscribed from reading it, much less outsiders.The verse reads thus:Guhua's arts I have studied long, in its secrets I am trained, now its long-lost depths fall upon me like the coming of blessed rain.The beating heart of Guhua's sword art is as a shower of floating flowers. One amidst may seize a bloom, but those without read only doom.The Guhua lance is a lantern's dance, like flames in night's deep glooming. Like sparks, they scatter with ease in the dark, then join like the daybreak looming.They say the sword is as your arm — I say its glint is the beholder's eye, a light like the bright dawn coming.Those who wander are burdened not. Freely they cut rain, and enlightened they pierce light. Like a snaking dragon, they cannot be subdued. In their right eye the blade, and in the other the spear.This text should have been free for all to read. The only reason why it was sealed is the dreadful handwriting.

They're quite interesting, those two.About Xinyan Media:VO_Xiangling About Xinyan.ogg Media:VO ZH_Xiangling About Xinyan.ogg Media:VO JA_Xiangling About Xinyan.ogg Media:VO KO_Xiangling About Xinyan.ogg Xinyan always comes to the Wanming Restaurant for a late-night snack!

He looks introverted enough, but there was this one time when he came to one of my performances. A friend brought him or something, and he had some words for me, but I couldn't hear 'em over the music. Before I knew it, he was right up there on the stage with me, singing and rockin' his heart out.

Their approach to business is meticulous and thorough, and every business meeting I've had with them has always been attended by the head of the house himself. Last time, though, I happened to meet their youngest, Xingqiu. To my complete surprise, the lad had no trouble whatsoever keeping up with my train of thought. He was very eloquent, too, and had excellent manners. Mm, definitely not a simpleton.YelanAbout Xingqiu Media:VO_Yelan About Xingqiu.ogg Media:VO ZH_Yelan About Xingqiu.ogg Media:VO JA_Yelan About Xingqiu.ogg Media:VO KO_Yelan About Xingqiu.ogg Of course I remember him — the young master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild.

Haha, he is quite the clever one, and with a sharp wit as well. The moment you let your guard down, you're at risk of becoming the butt of one of his practical jokes... Don't say I didn't warn you.
Just the Two of Us! (2020-10-09)It's a nice time again. (2021-10-09)To Whomsoever Finds This Letter (2022-10-09)I Have a Plan... (2023-10-09)
Xingqiu's handwriting is extremely messy to the point that most people have difficulty understanding it:
The Guhua head had to lock up his verse on the "Martial Principles" because he did not want anyone else to see the dreadful writing.
When Xingqiu hands a note to the Traveler to bring to the Feiyun Commerce Guild, Paimon notes that she can't understand it while the Traveler believes it to be from an ancient script or a secret text requiring a cipher.
The Yae Publishing House considers his signature to be quite the "tortured thing" to the point that without careful observation, it could be mistaken for part of the pattern on the box set's lid.
The Stone Gate Bulletin Board has a message from Xingqiu, which the Traveler can no longer decipher after a few words.
On the Qingce Village Bulletin Board, one message mentions an "urbane swordsman" bringing more books to the village, with extremely messy notes scribbled inside. Granny Ruoxin interprets them as exorcist symbols.
Xingqiu left an anonymous message on the Feiyun Slope Bulletin Board. The reply to it was likely written by Xu.
Xingqiu is the secret author of the novel A Legend of Sword.
The novel is a big hit in Inazuma and has also gained traction in Fontaine.[6]
Albedo provides illustrations for the book under the pen name Calx.[7]
Xingqiu shares actresses with other characters across the various voiceover languages:
His English voice actress, Cristina Vee Valenzuela, also voices Bennett.
His Korean voice actress, Gwak Gyu-mi (곽규미), also voices Ningguang.
His Chinese voice actress, Tang Yajing (唐雅菁), also voices Beidou.
Xingqiu is the first playable character to appear in a non-event World Quest (Yae Publishing House's Invitation).
Xingqiu is seen wielding the Silver Sword in his wish art.
Xingqiu is known by these aliases or titles:
Hong'yu (in Zero Hour Invokation)
Xu reveals that Xingqiu is in charge of Feiyun Commerce Guild's silk trade (which possibly also alludes to his ascension material) - however Xingqiu often disappears from his duties which causes Xu to worry.
Gaiman indirectly mentions him while speaking about A Legend of Sword.
Musheng reveals that Xingqiu once saved his life from bandits.
Sun Yu and Little Que'er are his senior disciples within the Guhua Clan, though he exceeded them at a much younger age. Sun Yu mentions him in his dialogue.
During the Fleeting Colors in Flight event, Little Zuo calls Chongyun and Xingqiu as weirdos who always go to Qingce Village discussing "evil spirits" and assumes that they are writing a story.
Xingqiu is mentioned in the descriptions of the following 2 Furnishings: Calligraphy Set: Assiduous Calligraphy Book Lover's Study
Xingqiu's name comprises the Chinese characters 行 xíng, meaning "to travel, to drift," and 秋 qiū, which means "autumn." Read together, Xingqiu's name can be parsed as "the gentle progression of autumn."
Xingqiu published A Legend of Sword under the penname Zhenyu (Chinese: 枕玉 Zhěnyù, lit. "pillow of jade").[8] Prior to Version 2.2, this penname was instead Chenqiu (Chinese: 沉秋 Chénqiū, lit. "sunken autumn"),[6] as mentioned by Gaiman. This later proved to be an inconsistency during the release of the World Quest Yae Publishing House's Invitation in Version 2.0. As of Version 2.2, all instances of the name "Chenqiu" were corrected to "Zhenyu."
During the Event Duel! The Summoners' Summit! Xingqiu competes under the name Hong'yu (Chinese: 虹雨 Hóngyǔ, lit. "iridescent rain").
His title is a reference to a poem by the Tang Dynasty poet Wei Zhuang (Chinese: 韦庄) that reads, "Yet today I recall the joys of Jiangnan — my garment during those youthful years lightweight and free" (Chinese: 如今却忆江南乐，当时年少春衫薄 Rújīn què yì Jiāngnán lè, dāngshí niánshào chūnshān báo).

Though he understands me quite well, one has to exercise caution when teaming up with him to go on a quest.

Especially when she's just coming back from collecting new ingredients — the more excited she looks, the more dangerous it is to approach. Because if she sees you, she'll force you to taste-test her latest concoction... I usually get Chongyun to handle these situations, hehe...

From the way they were acting, he must be a very high-profile figure indeed. I also heard that he directs funerals for adepti, so he must surely have great depth to his character.

Ms. Yelan gives me precisely this feeling. When she came to visit my family, my father and brother treated her with respect, and she was pleasant and polite in return.

↑ The phrase "But the stag's final resting place represents the hope for life anew" is a mistranslation; it is better translated as "But the stag represents the hope of being unexpectedly rescued from a desperate situation."
↑ Based on his original Chinese line, "There's no point in bringing it up anyway" is better translated as "If we talk about it openly, then there's no point in it," referring to Xingqiu's interest becoming a hero like the ones in the martial arts novels he reads.
