A loud and proud descendant of the crimson oni, Itto is also the leader and founder of the Arataki Gang. While not a villain, his reputation as a delinquent in Inazuma City leaves something to be desired.
Itto's outfit. It has an uncommon air of awesomeness about it, and the oni mask worn at the hip is quite imposing indeed — certainly enough to reduce even the naughtiest child of Hanamizaka to terrified tears.
Unlocked upon obtaining character

OverviewLoreVoice-OversOutfitsCompanionGallery
Fast as the wind and mighty as thunder, he is an intrepid man with Oni blood running through his veins.—Official Character Introduction[1]
The first and greatest head of the Arataki Gang, famed throughout Inazuma City's Hanamizaka... Wait, what? You've never heard of them? Are you trying to be funny here?—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Despite appearing as "mean and overbearing," Itto is a kind soul at heart, apart from trying to pick a fight with Kujou Sara at every possible opportunity. He is not particularly intelligent, but can put in the effort when asked of him. He is respected by his gang and mostly liked by Inazuma City's people, especially children, but is at odds with the Tenryou Commission despite his mostly harmless antics and pranks.
Itto takes pride in his oni heritage and does not like those who discriminate his kind. He appreciates the sacrifice made by his blue oni brethren for ensuring that oni could be accepted into human society in the present day, even wanting to share the results with them as thanks for their efforts. He always remembers the age-old pact between the oni tribes and never uses his strength for malicious purposes, refusing to terrorize humans and steal rewards that he hadn't claimed legitimately. Due to this pride, he is extremely competitive,[2] although he knows when to concede.[3]
Itto also has a habit of making names on the go and maintaining his appearance no matter how severe the weather can be. Despite only being part-oni, Itto is extremely allergic to beans; making contact with one can cause significant shock, while consuming them can cause him to be bedridden for prolonged periods of time.[4]
Itto uses the tall male model. He has white spiked hair with pale red streaks that goes down to his back. As an oni, he has two red horns on his forehead. Itto also has eyes that fade from red to yellow and diamond-shaped pupils and has pointed ears. His face is painted with red makeup which extends from his upper eyelid to this lower eyelid, and numerous parts of his body, arms and head are also painted with red lines.
Oni of Hanamizaka with a bold heroic spirit
Hello, I'm Kuki Shinobu, deputy of the Arataki Gang. I handle the affairs of the gang. If you come across any inappropriate behavior on the part of our boss, Arataki Itto, please contact me immediately. Here is my business card.—Kuki Shinobu
Fast as the wind and mighty as thunder, he is an intrepid man with Oni blood running through his veins.
His key traits would be his striking horns and piercing voice that never goes unnoticed.
He is an untamed soul who is wild and free, that even a person with the boldest imagination can be surprised by him.
His heroic spirit and ardent heart guide him wherever he goes.
His happiness is exuberant in each and every passing moment!
Have you heard of the Arataki Gang before?
No? No problem, from today on, we are now acquainted. We are the Arataki Gang of Hanamizaka. Of course, you must be introduced to our most prominent leader: Arataki Itto!
While walking through Hanamizaka, it is hard not to notice a young man of the oni race named Arataki Itto.Never mind his horns or piercing voice sticking out like sore thumbs — the sight of him enthusiastically joining in to play childrens' games is enough to set him apart from the crowd.In any case, his obvious lack of things to do stands in stark contrast to Hanamizaka itself, where craftspeople gather in droves and busy themselves all day long.Itto claims to be the "first and greatest head of the Arataki Gang," the responsibilities and duties of which he tried to explain to some Tenryou Commission officials when they came to him to investigate a rather harmless street brawl. Unfortunately, they interrupted him not two minutes into the explanation before marking him down as "unemployed."That designation is not exactly accurate, of course: other than the Gang's activities, which the Shogunate does not acknowledge, Itto does also do some odd jobs to stay solvent, usually working one day before taking three days off.As such, a more accurate designation should have been "three-quarters unemployed."Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Objectively speaking, Itto's reputation leaves much to be desired within Inazuma City.Even though he is not considered a villain, he is certainly no law-abiding citizen either. If one really had to assign some sort of hazard level to him, then perhaps the level of being used by parents to keep naughty children in line ("If you don't behave, Arataki Itto will come and snatch your snacks away!" for example) might suffice.That said, unlike threats of "the Great Mujina Youkai grabbing you and taking you deep into the mountains," or "being inlaid upon the Shogun's statue," the scenario threatened here can actually occur.Still, "snatching" is, again, not accurate, for the fate of these snacks is decided fair and square by ritual combat!In the eyes of many, winning snacks off kids in competitions is exceedingly shameless, but Itto believes that every battle must be taken seriously, whether one's foe is a 5-year old child or the Almighty Shogun herself.It is also due to this conviction that Itto can lose to a child without any reservations at all.And while the adults have much to say about his behavior, the children find Itto the big oni to be a rather good playmate.He is knowledgeable about all manner of street games and plays them all with great gusto. He also stands up for any who are being bullied.Lately, the children have been very into Onikabuto battles against Itto.The rules of this game are simple and the fighting is both fierce and very watchable. Most importantly of all, they actually have a pretty decent chance of winning this one, unlike with other games.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
For the longest time, the Tenryou Commission has regarded the Arataki Gang as a group of only occasional troublemakers who do not require that much attention.This group only has less than 10 regular members and there are many internal disagreements concerning the date of its founding.Akira believes that it all began when Itto saved him from a few two-bit ruffians. That day, Itto persisted even after having been knocked to the ground 7 times, ultimately causing the punks to back off in annoyance. Helping Akira up from the ground, Itto declared: "Well, guess you're with the Arataki Gang now!"Genta and Mamoru believe that the Gang was truly founded at the end of a certain year when they all squatted on the outskirts of Inazuma City and roasted Lavender Melons.That day, not one of them had a single Mora to their name, and they were all very hungry indeed. While gorging himself on a melon, Itto said with a sigh, "We should roast Lavender Melons like this every year!"That said, neither Genta nor Mamoru thinks that these experiences need much memorializing.For Kuki Shinobu, the Gang was officially formed the first time she had to drag Itto's sorry behind out of Shogunate gaol, for this was the first time any official records had ever made mention of the Arataki Gang.As for Itto, he believes that the Arataki Gang existed from the first moment those words entered his mind.Unfortunately, he no longer remembers when that was.And as for Granny Oni, who has taken care of Itto since he was young, she believes that the Gang was never formed.To her, these children are just "Itto and his friends."Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
The land of Inazuma has been home to the oni race since antiquity.They existed here alongside the lordly Hakushin kitsune bloodline and the tengu.Such youkai often have supernatural abilities that humans could only look upon in envy, but the oni lack many special traits in that regard.Other than the horns on their heads, they are mostly remembered for their explosive tempers and penchant for making trouble.As for their legendary fear of beans, it has a scientific basis.As it turns out, oni are allergic to beans. However, because the oni bloodline has thinned out greatly over time, most people display only very minor allergic reactions.Unfortunately for Itto, his allergies are still pretty severe. Forget eating beans, so long as he makes skin contact with them, Itto will get itchy all over and even find it hard to breathe.This thus makes beans the only thing that the usually carefree Itto is particularly wary of in his daily life.For their part, the Arataki Gang members do not order any dishes made with beans, not even in private, as a mark of respect for him.Of all products made with beans, Itto fears Fried Tofu the most — indeed, he even says that the very sight of it leaves him feeling queasy for three days straight.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
And when one mentions Fried Tofu, a certain pyrrhic victory immediately comes to mind.The battle that caused that incident began as a rather pedestrian conflict: a fox-eared lady had happened to sit in the chair that Itto would customarily sit on while eating at his favorite food stand... and on his payday, no less.The two began a contest of words over whom the chair belonged to, culminating in a straight-up (unnecessary) battle.Itto, hungry from a hard day's work, chose an eating contest, while the fox-eared lady chose a theme of "kitsune ramen."Itto was momentarily at a loss when he realized that said ramen contained Fried Tofu, but with the oni race's pride on the line, he soldiered on gamely en route to victory nonetheless.And as for that innocent chair, it was ultimately given to Itto as a trophy by the rather mortified owner of the food stand.Regarding the various contests he has been in, there are two that still weigh on Itto's mind quite heavily.One of them is the rematch that he demanded of Kujou Sara, who defeated him and took his Vision as part of her duties in the Tenryou Commission.To this day, the Kujou has not agreed to the street corner sumo match, something that frustrates Itto to no end.The other incident happened many years ago when Itto was young. Then, he had gotten into an argument with a young tengu, the result of which was a sumo match in the Byakko Plain. Unexpectedly, the ensuing furor sent them both rolling down a mountain.In the end, it was the tengu who carried Itto, who could not walk after spraining his ankle, all the way home. Of course, the match went unsettled.Just his luck, Itto often thinks, that both such incidents had to do with tengu!Also, how on earth were these tengu all so strong despite looking so skinny?Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6  •  Rise Up, Golden Soul
Every oni child has probably heard the story of the Crimson Oni and the Blue Oni:The gentle, helpful Crimson Oni defeated the wicked Blue Oni, thus winning the respect of the humans.This was Itto's favorite story when he was young, and he was proud of his red oni horns and his Crimson Oni lineage.However, this simple pride was shaken by a certain incident.When incidents of robbery occurred in the village in which Itto lived, the Arataki family fell under suspicion on account of their oni heritage.Itto no longer remembers the details of that incident, but he remembers the wary, disgusted stares the villagers gave him and his parents as they left, and the parting words they said, which Itto has heard countless times since:"Once an oni, always an oni."No matter the time period, all oni are the same as far as humans are concerned. In that case, would it not be better to become the Blue Oni, whom people feared? Surely that was preferable to being like his parents, who were driven out despite having done nothing wrong.After his parents died of illness, the young Itto was turned out onto the streets, where he would lay into anyone who spoke ill of the oni race.Well, Itto was mostly the one getting laid into. But he proved quite the pain in the neck, never giving up no matter how many times they knocked him down.Still, he was only a child and eventually collapsed on the street due to exhaustion and hunger after a terrible round of beatings at the hands of some ruffians who had banded together against him.At this moment of crisis, Itto was saved by an old human woman."Why did you save me? Can't you see that I'm an oni?" "You must be hungry. Come, I've made some porridge.""I told you, I'm an oni! Can't you see them horns?" "Oh, I can see them. Do you want some of that porridge, by the way?""Agh, you know what, you're not listening to me at all. Oh, alright... One bowl of porridge, please." "Coming right up."The Great Singalong Friendship Lv. 4
As the year was drawing to a close, the Arataki Gang met to discuss how they might celebrate the turnover of the year.As opposed to more reputable organizations, the Arataki Gang did not have any fixed venues to hold their activities, which posed some... logistical issues.The Lavender Melon suggestion was quickly eliminated. While roasting melons itself was certainly not an issue, eating only that to celebrate the new year certainly was.An Onikabuto festival was considered, but the year's end was not mating season, and so the contestants would not be half as motivated as they usually were.Ultimately, lots were drawn, and the "Great Singalong" was selected.This activity was suggested by Itto himself, and it entailed everyone standing on a cliff and singing against the ocean wind to express their innermost feelings and well-wishes for the future.The various gang members actually rejected this in their hearts when they found out about it. After all, screaming into the wind was nowhere near as fun as eating melons. Kuki Shinobu even indicated that she would like to take leave to return home on that day.However, the event went through nonetheless. The yelling and hollering were indeed quite soothing for the soul — and as things unexpectedly turned out, Itto was quite the good singer as well.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
Itto's Vision was something he found under his hip after waking up one morning. By that point, he had already been in Hanamizaka for many a year, and his livelihood was at least somewhat stable."Well I never! Dad, Mom, Gramps, Granny, and Granny Oni, this... Now isn't this something?"These were Itto's real thoughts as he first looked upon his Vision.That day, he would excitedly show his Vision to every person he met, even showing people where it had made an indentation on his back until everyone was thoroughly sick of hearing the story.A few days later, however, the story would change a little:"Now as you know, I wasn't surprised at all when I first saw that Vision. I mean, you'd expect as much out of the first and greatest head of the Arataki Gang, after all!""More importantly, a person's worth isn't something that can be determined by a mere Vision, oh no, sir!"The keen-eyed, however, would notice that Itto had bought a very soft spectacle cloth.Also, a certain question showed up in the advice column of the "That's Life" magazine that went like this:"Ms. Hina, how should I best take care of my Vision and make it shinier? And when I say 'shinier,' I mean shinier than everyone else's, of course!"When gang members read this and excitedly showed the magazine to Itto, they were surprised to see the long-time fan of Ms. Hina just look at the mag casually before laying it aside.

Main article: Arataki Itto/Lore/History
Arataki Itto is known by these aliases or titles (most of which were invented by himself):
Arataki "A Vision Returned" Itto[5]
Arataki "Above All, Bold-Blooded" Itto[6]
Arataki "Beetle Gladiator" Itto[7]
Arataki "Burning Passion for Battle" Itto[5]
Arataki "He Might Lose but He'll Never Admit Defeatto"[7]
Arataki "Live Long and Prosper" Itto[8]
Arataki "No Prison Food For Me" Itto[9]
Arataki "Number One Gourmet" Itto[10]
Arataki "Numero Uno Idioso" (by Paimon)[11]
Arataki "The One and Oni" Itto[7]
Arataki "The Oni Sumo King" Itto[7][15]
Arataki "The Pride of Oni" Itto[7]
Arataki "The Ultimate TCG Champion" Itto[7]
Arataki "The Unbeaten Troublemaker" Itto[18]
Arataki "To the Victor Go the Spoils" Itto[9]
Prince of Mischief (by himself)[21]
Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King (by Kamisato Ayato)[22]
Itto's (and by extension, all Onis') allergic reaction to fried tofu/bean products is a reference to the Japanese tradition of mamemaki celebrated during Setsubun, in which beans are thrown at people wearing oni (or demon) masks to purify the household for the upcoming year.
Itto's voice-overs "More About Itto: II" and "Least Favorite Food" indicate that the people of Inazuma also partake in mamemaki, but for all minor life events instead.
Itto is a half-blooded oni due to the oni blood thinning over time as a result of oni integrating with humans, as the original onis' skin were fully blue or crimson, although this has not spared him from an extremely allergic response to beans.
Both Itto and Paimon share the same birthday, being June 1, International Day for Protection of Children. It is widely celebrated in countries such as Armenia, Burma, Cambodia, China, Ethiopia, Mongolia, Russia and Portugal, where it is considered a national holiday, and fairs are even hosted for children. The two characters having this birthday date might relate to their childlike nature, and how both are good at handling children.
Arataki Itto is mentioned in the description of the following Furnishing: Inazuman Bamboo-Roofed Home: Wild Heart
His family name (Japanese: 荒瀧 Arataki) means "rough rapids" and implies that he is a descendant of Arataki of the Front Gate; whereas the kanji in his given name (Japanese: 一斗 Itto) means "one dipper."
The Japanese name of his constellation (Japanese: 天ノ牛座 Ten no Ushi-za) literally means the "Heavenly Ox constellation."
The Chinese name of his constellation (Chinese: 天牛座 Tiānniú Zuò) may also be a reference to the longhorn beetle family Cerambycidae, which translates to 天牛科.
Considering his constellation names in Latin and Japanese, Arataki Itto may be inspired by the half-Shinto half-Buddhist deity Gozu Ten'nou (also known as Gion Tenjin), literally meaning "Ox-Headed Heavenly King," who is said to serve as the guardian of Jetavana (Gion Shouja in Japanese), a holy Buddhist site in India. He is often identified with the raging storm kami Susanoo in Shinto and the Medicine Buddha Bhaisajyaguru in Buddhism.
His main shrine is Yasaka Shrine, Kyoto. The shrine is best known for the Gion Festival, one of the most important and largest festivals in Japan, and Gion, an entertainment district where most of geisha in Kyoto are working. These may account for Itto's unorthodox and frank nature.
Minami-za, the oldest extant kabuki theater that was founded in 1610, is also located in Gion. This may have influenced Itto's vigorous, kabuki-esque costume, most notably kumadori, or red makeup in his face.
Japanese Buddhist legends have an ox-headed oni called Gozu (inspired by Niutou in the Chinese mythology), who serves as a jailer of the underworld. Although Gozu Ten'nou and Gozu are different entities in the real mythology, the similarity in their names and iconography may explain Itto's oni heritage.
In the introduction of the late 13th century Japanese historical epic The Tale of the Heike (Japanese: 平家物語 Heike Monogatari), Jetavana and the Sacred Sal Trees, whose Japanese name is the Sara Souju (Japanese: 裟羅双樹), are co-revered as the symbols of transience and impermanence. This may have inspired Itto's rivalry and friendship with Kujou Sara.
Another important heavenly bull in the Japanese mythology is the divine animal servant of Tenjin, the god of academics and thunder, although it does not seem to have much in common with Itto.
His Japanese constellation name may be also a reference to the Bull of Heaven in Mesopotamian mythology, which was identified with the constellation Taurus.
His Latin constellation name, Taurus Iracundus, can translate to "Raging Bull"; the ring name of American professional boxer Jake LaMotta, who was known for his rough fighting style and reputation as a "bully" in the ring.

Well! Hahaha! Sorry to break it to ya, but I'm a delinquent. That means it's my job to not have a real job, and if anyone's got a problem with that... Who's got a problem with that, huh? You got a problem with that!? You got a problem with— *coughing* Sorry. Got a little worked up there. Where was I? Ah yeah, so work isn't really my thing, but don't worry — I don't rob or steal or anything like that. When I'm really runnin' low on funds, I just take the odd job here and there to make ends meet. You know, like transporting stuff, delivering documents, helping businesses attract customers... Just enough to keep the wolf from the door. Hehe!

Unfortunately, there's still plenty of people out there who've got a bone to pick with us. Hmm? Change? Oh yeah, things are gonna change, alright! You can count on that! But I'll tell you what, it won't involve any sucking up to the humans on my part, nuh-uh! I'm gonna let my actions do the talkin'. They'll come to respect me eventually.

I could really see you as a member of the gang, you know — I mean, you really have what it takes... Whaddya say? I've even come up with a catchy title to tag on after your name, get this: "The Traveler, 'Second to One'"! Get it? 'Cause y'know, I'm numero uno, you're my number two, and together we're the most powerful duo in the whole friggin' world, baby! Hahaha! Ah... But, uh, all jokes aside, I know you're on some important journey or whatever. So, go ahead! Get out there and do whatcha wanna do! Just remember, the Arataki Gang will always answer your call.
About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arataki Itto About the Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arataki_Itto_About_the_Vision.ogg Ugh, don't even ask. Just the thought of it makes my blood boil! First, the Shogun's Army goes out and steals everyone's precious Visions — which, already a heinous crime, right? But then... then they go and stick them all over that statue with absolutely no sense of organization whatsoever. I mean, think about it... the more powerful the Vision, the higher up on the statue it should go, that would make sense, right? But nooo, some class-A jerk in the Tenryou Commission thought it'd be funny to put my Vision right at the very bottom! Ugh... Come on!

Ms. Hina always manages to come up with an encouraging and heartwarming response for all her readers. Just look at me — I used to be a lost soul, but not anymore, and it's all thanks to her. Oh, that reminds me, I managed to sign up for one of her upcoming meet-and-greets! I've been counting down the days — wish it would go faster...
Something to Share: HornsSomething to Share: HornsMedia:VO_Arataki Itto Something to Share - Horns.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arataki_Itto_Something_to_Share_-_Horns.ogg Question for ya! Do my horns look boring once you get used to them? 'Cause, uh, I was thinking of switching up the style, going for a total overhaul, you know? I'm thinking paint them in rainbow stripes and then strap a few Fireflies on for good measure! Eh, eh? I bet that would turn some heads on the streets... like "Dude, you're rockin' those sweet rainbow horns, man!" ...Ah, man, this is totally genius! I'm gonna round up the gang and get them working on it ASAP.

It's all in the eyeballs. You gotta keep those bad boys squeaky clean at all times, make sure your eyesight's as sharp as a hawk. Trust me, when you're in the middle of a thunderstorm, and the rain's coming down, and the wind's blowing in your face, you gotta watch out, because Lavender Melons and Onikabuto? Well, they can really start to look the same... believe me, I know.
About Thoma Friendship Lv. 4About Thoma Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arataki Itto About Thoma.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arataki_Itto_About_Thoma.ogg Some of the boys have been telling me that he was the star of the show at the Vision Hunt Ceremony. I'm like — are you kidding me??? How come he gets his own special ceremony!? Was the hundredth Vision supposed to be, like, stronger than the other ninety-nine, or something? Pff, nah, it can't have been that, 'cause, uh, hello! They would've chosen me if that's what they were going for.
About Kamisato Ayato Friendship Lv. 4About Kamisato Ayato Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arataki Itto About Kamisato Ayato.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arataki_Itto_About_Kamisato_Ayato.ogg Haha, I only wish I could have met Ayato sooner. He really taught me something. "You can kindle the warrior spirit even in the weakest of bugs"... Yep, I really took that one to heart. If it weren't for those words of wisdom, I'm pretty sure I would have given up beetle fighting after losing for the 780th time... Yeah, I guess sometimes it takes a warrior to understand a warrior. When we're playing trading card games or battling beetles, we're always totally on the same wavelength.
About Yoimiya Friendship Lv. 4About Yoimiya Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arataki Itto About Yoimiya.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arataki_Itto_About_Yoimiya.ogg Hmph, she's always showing off her fancy fireworks and toys to the kids. Well, I'm sick of it! Nobody steals my thunder! I'm the one that's supposed to be adored by the kids! Me! That goes for you too, you're siding with me on this, okay... Huh? Whaddya mean, you're not a kid? Eh, details. If you're shorter than me, you're a kid as far as I'm concerned.
About Kaedehara Kazuha Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over MortalsAbout Kaedehara Kazuha Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over MortalsMedia:VO_Arataki Itto About Kaedehara Kazuha.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arataki_Itto_About_Kaedehara_Kazuha.ogg Word on the street is that he blocked the Musou no Hitotachi after you escaped from Tenshukaku. Seriously? 'Cause I mean, that is awesome! Who knows how he pulled it off. Hey, now that I think about it, he's from a fallen clan, and I'm from a fallen clan... That kinda makes us equals, haha! Yeah, so next time someone attacks you, it's my turn to block the blade!
About the Raiden Shogun Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over MortalsAbout the Raiden Shogun Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over MortalsMedia:VO_Arataki Itto About the Raiden Shogun.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arataki_Itto_About_the_Raiden_Shogun.ogg During the Vision Hunt Decree, the Shogun had to send her top tengu in person to get my Vision off me. Heh, means she must have found me to be quite the pain in the neck. But, y'know, she's abolished the Vision Hunt Decree now, so no hard feelings, I guess. As long as she's learned her lesson, of course. 'Cause if she pulls something like that again, this old pain in the neck will be back with a vengeance.

Even all that Fried Tofu couldn't stand in my way — she didn't come close to beating me! ... I was, uh, bedridden for more than a month after that, but you know what? I'd rather lie in bed a winner than walk away a loser! So... Anyway, I had the last laugh, 'cause she had to foot the bill for 32 bowls of noodles! Haha!
About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4 The Immovable God and the Eternal EuthymiaAbout Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4 The Immovable God and the Eternal EuthymiaMedia:VO_Arataki Itto About Kujou Sara.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arataki_Itto_About_Kujou_Sara.ogg You know what, yeah, she beat me during the Vision Hunt Decree. I'm not ashamed to admit it. When you lose, you admit defeat, and when you screw up, you take it on the chin, like a man! And anyway, let's not forget which one of us won't agree to a rematch — her, the tengu warrior! It's just a sumo street fight, I mean, what's she so afraid of? If she keeps snubbing me, I'm gonna have to stop calling her Kujou Tengu and start calling her Kujou Chicken! Heh, we'll see what she thinks of that.
About Gorou Friendship Lv. 4About Gorou Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arataki Itto About Gorou.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arataki_Itto_About_Gorou.ogg Oh yeah, the doggy general in the resistance... Hey, I've gotta hand it to him, he may be on the small side, but he's got quite the fighting spirit. Also, he gives off this vibe that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, almost as if he understands my innermost feelings... I mean, I've barely met the guy, so that's kinda weird.
About Kuki Shinobu Friendship Lv. 4About Kuki Shinobu Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arataki Itto About Kuki Shinobu.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arataki_Itto_About_Kuki_Shinobu.ogg Nobody questions my leadership in the gang, what I say goes — except when it comes to Shinobu. She's always challenging everything I say. And not only that — all the hard-earned loot I bring back and share with everyone? She goes and returns it! But also, she gets me out of jail, and out of every mess we get ourselves into, so I'll let it slide. Besides, I don't wanna get on her bad side... An angry Shinobu would make my life a nightmare.
About Sayu Friendship Lv. 4About Sayu Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arataki Itto About Sayu.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arataki_Itto_About_Sayu.ogg All I did was give her a little pat on the head this one time when she wasn't looking, and now, she pounces to attack every time she lays eyes on me. Haha, what can I say? Tanuki are adorable! What am I supposed to do — not pat one on the head? ...Oh yeah, and that's the other thing — she beats you up for calling her a tanuki, too! What's up with that? I mean, a tanuki's what she's going for, right? Sheesh, talk about getting your fur all ruffled over nothing...

Well, you're right, those are just child's play. Wanna know the hard skills that really got me where I am? Eating ramen standing upside down, sleeping with my eyes open, playing the harmonica with my nose, and swatting houseflies with my hair. Yeah, I know. Betcha see it now, huh?

Fortune in, oni out. Fortune in, oni out!" ...Ugh, the chant gets worse every time I hear it, but the streets full of beans, with my allergies? Total disaster. I've gotta fix this, for every oni out there! We're innocent, people! Quit trying to ward us off and drive us out every time there's a minor life event!

"attempt"... to end human prejudice toward the oni, I had the gang use a Kamera to take a picture of me showing my softer side and stick it to the Message Board in Inazuma City. Next thing we know, some jerks have graffitied all over it! Tsk! Then, some ashigaru blockheads from the Tenryou Commission accused me of disrupting the peace, next it was the Yashiro Commission, complaining it ruined the atmosphere in the area, and finally, even the Kanjou Commission got involved — they sent some lackeys over demanding advertising tax! Ugh, they have no idea who the bad guys are here!

Don't listen to the people who call us freaks, or weirdos. Every member of my gang is like family to me, and they all feel the same way. Whatever happens, the gang will face it together — both the highs and the lows.

In principle, though, I'm absolutely against it. No one should have to sacrifice their own kind for the sake of a better tomorrow, period. It's only a better tomorrow if it's a better tomorrow for everyone. We need to work together, not have everyone just focused on themselves, making their own sacrifice, trying to look cool in the process... Eh, I guess there's no changing the past, what's done is done. But from this day forward, no more sacrificing, not on my watch! You go to sacrifice yourself, I'll stand right in your way!

In fact, she's the kindest human that has ever lived. She only got her nickname because she took me in. If people have got a problem with me, fine, I don't care what other people think anyway... *sigh* But I wish people wouldn't go after her because of me.

We have to get people to resist this constant urge to throw beans everywhere!

Media:vo itto mimitomo hello 01.ogg Arataki Itto: You're here, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! Finally!
Media:vo itto mimitomo hello 02.ogg Arataki Itto: Welcome to stronghold numero two of the Arataki Gang, haha!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Uh... is that a trick question? This is me we're talking about...
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Arataki Itto: Send me anywhere in the world — anywhere at all — and I guarantee you I'd be able to live there.
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Arataki Itto: I've slept on the streets, down at the dock, deep in the forest... Pretty much everywhere! Of course, comfort-wise, the cells at the Police Station are up there at the top of the list.
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Arataki Itto: That was all before I met you, though.
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Arataki Itto: This place is something else! In fact, I'm gonna go on the record and say that the comfort level here is like 10... No, what am I saying — 100 prison cells rolled into one!
 I don't want it to be like any number of prison cells!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship1 06a 1.ogg Arataki Itto: Why not? They're great!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship1 06a 2.ogg Arataki Itto: Anyway, look me in the eyes, and listen up, okay? This place is awesome!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship1 06b 1.ogg Arataki Itto: Haha! Seriously though, I'm just telling it how it is. I think we're past the point where we need to be polite to each other all the time.
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship1 06b 2.ogg Arataki Itto: If it's okay with you, I might actually make this my main pad. It's a sweet deal, I'm pretty psyched at the idea of crashing here every night...
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship1 07.ogg Arataki Itto: Anyway... point made, boom. I'm not gonna drag it out like some... granny at a tea party.
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship1 08.ogg Arataki Itto: But the code of the streets says I should find a way to express my, uh, you know, gratitude... but, I know... I—I can be your bouncer here!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Arataki Itto: *sigh*... Argh... where do I start...
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Arataki Itto: I've been doing some thinking over the last couple of days about how I keep losing my Onikabuto fights, and, well... I'm starting to think that maybe I should just give it up now.
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Arataki Itto: Maybe it's time to make a clean break, you know? To stop wasting my time on things which just don't matter.
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Arataki Itto: You bet — I'm giving up Onikabuto fights for good! From this day forward, it's Fireflies all the way, baby!
 Maybe the issue isn't about the bugs...
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 05a 1.ogg Arataki Itto: Not about the bugs... like how? Are you saying I should go for a boar instead? Or a bird maybe? Nah... too much hard work!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 05a 2.ogg Arataki Itto: You do you have a point though — swapping out one kind of bug for another won't necessarily improve my odds of winning...
 Maybe it's to do with the people you're playing with...
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 05b 1.ogg Arataki Itto: The people? Nah! No way. Not possible!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 05b 2.ogg Arataki Itto: The kids I battle with might talk a whole lot, and sure, there's a few pranksters among them — but they're no cheaters!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Arataki Itto: Anyway, whatever. At the end of the day, I just haven't found the bug for me. Ugh, seems like you can't go looking for a strong companion, you've gotta wait for the right one to come along...
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Arataki Itto: Luckily for me, you're not like them at all: You and I are like an absolute powerhouse together!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Arataki Itto: Hahaha, right, there's that too! I was just kidding, of course. My mind never even went there.
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Arataki Itto: If we ever got into a situation where a fight was unavoidable, naturally I'd be the one to take it for the team.
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Arataki Itto: All you'd have to do is stand back and root for me. At the top of your voice, you know, really giving it all you've got. When it comes to the atmosphere, you've gotta go big or go home!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 11.ogg Arataki Itto: Haha... All we're missing now is a catchy chant...
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 12.ogg Arataki Itto: Ummm... Okay, okay, I think I got something: "Arataki Itto, the strongest in his class! Meet him on the street-o, he'll make you kiss his feet-o!"
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship2 13.ogg Arataki Itto: Sound good? Haha. Alright, let's practice it together now!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Hey! Perfect timing. There's something I need to talk to you about. Something important. Has to be face to face.
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Arataki Itto: So this, uh, Adventurers' Guild — what kind of things do they do? And which tasks do you normally take?
 You want to join the Adventurers' Guild?
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Arataki Itto: Hah, me? No way!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Arataki Itto: You gotta be there, what, every other day? They seem to work you pretty hard, so...
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Arataki Itto: I'mma put my boys on the case! Many hands make light work and all that, y'know...
 Oh right... You want to help me.
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 06a 1.ogg Arataki Itto: Wait, what do you mean, "oh right"!? C'mon, that's hurtful, where's the enthusiasm?
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 06a 2.ogg Arataki Itto: Next time, I don't wanna hear "oh right, Itto wants to help." I wanna hear "darn right, Itto wants to help"! Got it?
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 06b 1.ogg Arataki Itto: Ahem... I was hoping for more of a "sorry, I didn't ask you to help, Itto" than a "thank you"!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 06b 2.ogg Arataki Itto: I know you've asked other people for help in the past, so why not me, huh? What's that about?
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Arataki Itto: I see you as a member of the Arataki Gang! You do know that, don't you?
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Arataki Itto: Every single member of my gang is like family to me. And, you know... same goes for you.
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Arataki Itto: That makes this a family matter, you get it? Which means, leave it to Itto!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Arataki Itto: Don't you worry now, I've got your back wherever you go. Whether you're cruising the city or wandering the wilds, my boys will be there!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Arataki Itto: Ah, except... only in Inazuma. How am I supposed to protect you if you leave?
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Arataki Itto: Hah! Guess it's time for the Arataki Gang to start expanding into other nations!
 Don't worry about me, I can look after myself!
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 13.ogg Arataki Itto: Haha, that's the spirit! That's what makes you part of my crew.
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 14.ogg Arataki Itto: Guess that settles it then. When I'm not around, promise me you'll carry on being a champ and living life to the max.
Media:vo itto mimitomo friendship3 15.ogg Arataki Itto: And when I say being a champ — that means kicking some serious butt, alright? I don't care if you're playing card games or you're brawling — no losing! Not to anyone!
Media:vo itto mimitomo morning 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Good morning, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! It really is — seriously, I slept like a baby last night, so I am feeling prett-tay pumped this morning!
Media:vo itto mimitomo morning 02.ogg Arataki Itto: So, what're you up to today, huh? Need my help with anything? Whatever it is, just say the word and Itto is on the case!
Media:vo itto mimitomo night 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Wait... what? You're hitting the hay already?
Media:vo itto mimitomo night 02.ogg Arataki Itto: Come on, sleep is for the weak! Not champions like you and I! You wanna play some Hide-and-Seek?
Media:vo itto mimitomo night 03.ogg Arataki Itto: Playing at night takes it to a whole other level. Seriously, I'm preparing to go full oni on you here — so make sure you find a good hiding spot, capiche!?
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.
Media:vo mimitomo dq itto fiesta 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh boy, you did not disappoint. This festive street is exactly my scene!
Media:vo mimitomo dq itto fiesta 02.ogg Arataki Itto: ...Time to get serious, though. Let's pick a stall and go head-to-head, winner takes it all!
Media:vo mimitomo dq itto fiesta 03.ogg Arataki Itto: The loser has to, uhh... has to run around the place three times while shouting to the winner, "All Hail, King of the Festival!"
Media:vo mimitomo dq itto inazumawild 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Whoa, check it out, this looks just like Granny Oni's place...
Media:vo mimitomo dq itto inazumawild 02.ogg Arataki Itto: Pretty sweet. The scenery's really makin' my day!
Media:vo mimitomo dq itto inazumawild 03.ogg Arataki Itto: Let's go kick back in the shade. I'll tell you all my epic tales from roaming the wilds of Inazuma!
