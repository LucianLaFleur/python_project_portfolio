"The Knave," Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers. Revered as "Father" by the children of the House of the Hearth.—Description from the Official Website[1]
"The Knave," Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers. A poised, ruthless diplomant. To the children of the House of the Hearth, she is their feared yet dependable "Father."—In-game character attributes and profile page text
As one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, Arlecchino reveres the Tsaritsa,[2] though she states that she is willing to betray the Tsaritsa.[3] Arlecchino is working to achieve her goals by acquiring the Gnoses on her behalf. She handles Fatui matters with utmost importance and comes off as graceful and cordial. Although she is strict, she is more lenient than her predecessor, having imposed a more relaxed policy for her subordinates to complete their goals and does not punish them as severely for failure. While she does not like betrayal, she is not as cruel, as she was willing to spare traitors who demonstrated sufficient willpower by "executing" their identity in the House rather than outright killing them.
She is also addressed as "Father" by the House of the Hearth's members. However, it is suggested by her fellow Harbingers, believing she has ulterior motives, that she simply puts up an act in front of others, and that those who see her true, crazed nature vanish without a trace.[4]
Despite claiming to be a Fontanian, Arlecchino actually hails from Khaenri'ah. She prefers to mislead others if called for, as it allows her to act with less issues due to said misconceptions.[5] She also appears to have a soft spot for children, seeing that many members of the House of the Hearth are young and orphaned children taken in across Teyvat and views them all as her "children," becoming particularly angered when their well-being is threatened or manipulated.[6][7]
Arlecchino uses the tall female model. She sports black eyes with red "X"-shaped pupils and layered black and white hair, styled in a long ponytail with asymmetrical bangs.
Solitary Balemoon in a Sky of Fading Stars
"Fate grants favors to no one. Only those who would fight it with every ounce of their being may earn the right to challenge it."—Pierro, "The Jester"
To this day, Arlecchino still recalls that night when she was first appointed as a Harbinger.
Up the stairs and down the long gallery, with naught to see through the windows but a world of ice and snow without end.
The biting wind wailed loudly, now as mirthful laughter, now as somber farewell—
With a start, Arlecchino came to, the hallucinations of her memory mingling with the sounds of real-life conversation that surrounded her.
The hearthfire burned with vigor, its gentle warmth pervading the room, and its red light glowed on the children's faces, lighting up their innocent, unaffected smiles. If some uninformed passerby were to stumble in at this precise moment, they would surely mistake the scene before them for that of an ordinary, happy family.
But just as Arlecchino raised her steaming cup to take a sip of scalding-hot black tea, the clock began to chime — and within an instant, the laughter and cheer that filled the room were banished. The flames flickered so that for a moment the light faltered, the faces of all present cast in somber expression.
Placing her cup back down, Arlecchino stood up, and in a calm, measured tone, called out several names:
"Chapleau, you're with Lyney. Retrieve the required intelligence. Foltz, you and Filliol are on guard duty. Stay back and tend to the Hearth..."
Without a redundant syllable, nor a hint of hesitation, they answered as one.
Not long after, the fire had dwindled and the house fallen utterly silent, with nothing to be seen but a single shaft of infiltrating moonlight, peeking through a gap in the curtains upon a cup of gradually cooling tea.
The Hotel Bouffes d'ete, situated in the Vasari Passage, is a lovely building with clean walls and sparkling windows, and well-mannered, well-groomed children frequent it every day.Unlike other mansions of comparable beauty in the Court of Fontaine, the registered owner of this property does not live on-site. Indeed, nearby residents have not even heard of her.The signature on the relevant documentation is but a false identity — the real power lies with someone else.If one could hear the children whisper at night behind the Hotel's closed gates, one would hear this appellation: "Father."When speaking of "Father," some faces turn worshipful, some hearts are seized with fear, and still others look inscrutable, torn — but their tone always becomes one of respect.These children are part of the organization known as the House of the Hearth. They belong to the Fatui.This place is home to orphans the world over, and the luxurious Hotel is but one of the House's faces.As for this "Father," the master of the House, she is none other than The Knave, Arlecchino, presently Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers.The Fatui — and this Harbinger — enjoy a mixed reputation. But to most of these children, "Father" is the most important figure in their lives."It is only because 'Father' is here that this place is truly like a 'home.'"Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Almost all who have had dealings with The Knave have felt the unseen, oppressive weight that emanates from her.She commands any conversation with ease, and few can keep the secrets of their heart from showing on their faces when confronted with those unique eyes.Ever ruthless, she will settle affairs while talking and laughing, even being so considerate as to do those who come after a favor by rendering the area spotless, so as not to traumatize them.But none of that is what makes her most dangerous. "The unknown" has, after all, ever been the source of all dread.Even the children, who interact with her on a day-to-day basis, cannot claim to understand her. Not her hobbies, her dislikes, or the things on her mind when she gazes out to sea.Each August, they rack their brains thinking of birthday presents for her, and yet her reactions to each gift are virtually the same.This continued until last year, when Freminet was given a nasty shock by a lizard that leaped down from the ceiling. The little "invader" was caught by Lynette's sharp eyes and quick fingers and then imprisoned on top of the table by a bowl she swiftly seized.Both bowl and lizard wound up being taken for that year's gift by The Knave, who just happened to return home at that moment.The next day, when Lyney entered "Father"'s office to give a report, he found a familiar figure in the feeding box.The temperature and humidity within the box seemed to be eminently suitable for the little lizard, which seemed to be quite enjoying itself."Father" seemed to have experience in rearing reptiles.As The Knave raised her teacup, Lyney immediately shifted his gaze away from the lizard, but he quietly noted this incident to himself.The children seize every opportunity they can to get closer to their "Father," after all.Thus, Lyney, Lynette, and Freminet began looking up all sorts of knowledge regarding raising lizards, hoping to have something to discuss with "Father" when next they saw her.But just a few days later, when he next set foot in her office, the box was already empty."'Father'... What happened to that lizard?""It attempted to open the box lid a few times, so I gave it back its freedom. Our acquaintance was brief indeed, but that was the choice life made."The Knave's voice was completely calm. Looking at the confused Lyney, she then directed a casual finger at a bird that was poking about at the windowsill."Ah, yes. Not long after it left, the lizard became this one's lunch. Now it seems to want me to serve it seconds... Go chase it away."Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
Vanity is but human, and adolescent children gradually gain awareness of beauty and homeliness. They begin to surreptitious don accessories and trim their split hairs with scissors.Rebellious little tendencies such as these are of no concern to "Father," nor will she interfere.But should a child reveal their position during a night operation on account of a necklace she would not lay aside — now this would require a "Father"'s instruction.Thus did Arlecchino enter that girl's room, a lovely handbag in hand.The necklace had already been taken off and placed on the table, and the girl stood trembling next to it. She knew her error.Arlecchino scooped up the necklace and gazed upon it, before walking over and looping it back around the girl's unblemished neck.She then lifted the flowing gold locks around the child's ears. "Oh, you pierced them yourself."And so "Father" once more retrieved velvet ribbon and jeweled earrings from that bag, tying the girl's hair with the former, and affixing the latter to her ears.Then, taking her by the shoulders, she guided the girl before the mirror. The young lady reflected within was as a gem-encrusted noble rose, her beauty shining through the unease that blazed across her features."It is normal to be vain at your age. But do not let these beautiful trinkets arouse vanity and dull your intellect.""I'm sorry, 'Father,'" the young woman anxiously apologized, her terror evident.With quivering hands she reached for the earrings, making to unfasten them. "It won't happen again, I swear..."But the mirror showed only "Father"'s unwavering calm, her smile seemingly undimmed."Shh... Do not be so nervous. People often long for that which they cannot have, and it would not do for regret to make beautiful memories seem ever rosier.""Wear them. Once you have grown accustomed to them, you will realize that no gem, however exquisite, is any more than an object, cold and dead.""This is your new lesson — to understand the source of your emotions. Master them, use them. Never be their slave."Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4  •  When the Hearth-Flame Goes Out
Before "Father" rewrote the rules, the House of the Hearth had a wholly different face.The previous Knave was named Crucabena. Of course, few used that name directly, and the children all called her "Mother."And she seemed a perfect one: a friendly smile, a gentle demeanor, conscientiously caring for her family, and never without stories to tell the children.Yet, should you have been brought up in an even slightly ordinary environment, the tales she told would have curdled your blood and chilled you to the marrow...She would speak of unspeakable cruelties as if they were fairy-tale fantasies, guiding the House members to mutual slaughter, until the strongest among them was selected as "king."She called herself a mother, but never saw the Hearth as her home. To her, the unnumbered sacrifices were but an interesting experiment....Before taking the title of The Knave and changing her name to Arlecchino, the young girl had another name: Peruere.She was an orphan of unknown origin, like all others in the House of the Hearth — a "child" of their "Mother."Many knew that "Mother" favored her especially, indeed, caring far more for Peruere than even her own biological daughter, Clervie.As such, even to the last, few understood why Peruere repaid this kindness with a magnificent assassination.Crucabena's insane experimentation took place far from prying eyes, so naturally, almost none knew of them.Peruere was thus tarred as having committed "matricide," her madness known to all....Even after the dust had settled, she who had once been Peruere — and was now Arlecchino — did not offer any explanation.She indulged the spread of these rumors, and indeed added fuel to the fire from the shadows.Whether as a diplomat or assassin, one profits most from seeing through the other party while keeping oneself shrouded in mystery.A small tombstone stands at the site where she slew their "Mother," the eulogy penned by her hand."Here the last light of the setting sun lies buried. Here the coming dawn finds a welcome."Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5  •  When the Hearth-Flame Goes Out
To hide her origins and consign the truth to the flames, Arlecchino has always proclaimed herself a Fontainian.The truth is, however, that she discovered an ability to wield a strange fire from a young age.This attracted much curiosity, as no one in her "family" knew of such power. But at her young age, this seemed like no ability to be boasted of so much as a deep-rooted curse.Each time she let her vigilance wane, this power would run rampant, eating away at her body. First her fingers, then her palms, and then her forearms...The blackened marks were akin to those of burned charcoal, just as she seemed akin to burning firewood.Here she had a vague foreboding, that if this dark shadow were to creep up her shoulder, and snake from shoulder to heart, she would likely undergo some sort of "change."Perhaps that would be the moment fate tipped its hand to her....Even without the corrosion, this flame brought her other troubles.Those rendered ash by these fires would leave "afterimages." At times, they were fragments of memory, and at others, they donned the aspect of dazzling colors.As those who fell at her hand increased, Arlecchino began to hear various voices.Screams, wails, and hurled recriminations would wake her from dreams, and she soon grew used to this. She had few dreams worth remembering fondly, in any case, filled as most were with crimson moon and barren wilds.In cases few and far between, these afterimages would be complete enough to take on the form of a "conscious individual."Of course, these were hardly as special as "Clervie's shadow," but they would still appear by Arlecchino's side, driving the clamor away and buying her a moment's respite.Like children at play, they would gather for a time, and then drift away as they pleased.Arlecchino remembered who they were in life. But she would never call them by their names.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
After meeting the Tsaritsa, being bestowed with a Delusion, and inheriting the name "Arlecchino," the young Knave was also granted an individual audience with her superior.Director Pierro's expression lay hidden behind his half-mask."I know you still harbor dissatisfaction and doubt. As such, I will answer five of your questions concerning the world... or concerning yourself.""You need not ask for guarantees from me, ask about our programs and principles, or about Her Majesty's ideals. Those, I can answer freely and without reservation."Arlecchino did not wholly trust The Jester's open honesty."Then let me also state that I reject any deliberate mystifications or obfuscations, as well as word games and lies.""Most prudent. In that case, allow me to answer the first question weighing on you. Why did we choose you, and why did you accept? 'The naive will die for their ideals, but we are willing to endure even the meanest existence to accomplish our goals.'"..."Question three. What do my constant dreams of a crimson moon and my powers mean?""I once served the final dynasty of an ancient underground kingdom. Its dynastic name was 'Eclipse,' and before them came the 'Crimson Moon.' As for the secrets from before your birth... I suggest you purchase a book named 'Hierobranto Innamorato.' I read no such tales in the days when I pursued academic attainment and saw it only by chance. The circumstances depicted are specious, but the key details are accurate."..."Question five. What will become of me and the others in the House of the Hearth once everything is finished?""I will be frank. None of you have any place in my ideals, for I plan only to uphold 'the virtue of folly.' But I can guarantee that our Tsaritsa will once again be a god who loves all humans, and in her ideals shall all human wishes be granted."This "virtue of folly" was, of course, left enigmatic, but she accepted this answer nonetheless. The Fool had given five answers to her five questions, and the mist that covered her eyes was beginning to part."Arlecchino."Pierro called out to her as she departed, and she turned around."Rather than dwelling on how the world is now, you should consider to where it should go."The sounds of her departing footsteps as she spun on her heel and kept walking were the only reply."Marelle" Friendship Lv. 4
The House of the Hearth uses many codewords to maintain operational security and secrecy, and of these, "Marelle" was personally selected by The Knave herself."Marelle" takes its meaning from a popular Fontainian children's game. Boxes sequentially marked with numbers are drawn out on the ground, a sandbag is thrown into one of the boxes, and the player will jump from box to box in a specific order.No one knows when this game began to spread, nor who created the rules, but all young children of the Hearth have experienced being taken by older children to play the game.Light-footed leaps, boisterous laughter... The memories married to "Marelle" were always wonderful, like the kiss of radiant sunshine.As such, at first the children were perplexed when their "Father" was torn between assigning "At Ease" or "Danger" to that codeword.Little did they know that in the House that came before, Marelle was no game.In those days, each and every child would leap into the boxes one by one under the vigilant eyes of the adults. Stepping out of the lines or breaking the rhythm was not allowed.There was never a need to ask the punishment for making a bad jump, for the area outside of the boxes was lined with upturned blades.Those who lost their balance, whose stamina failed, or simply made an error out of fear... So, so many fell beyond the bounds, and the dark-red soil mourned that painful past.None would have associated it with being "at ease" — indeed, few could speak of it without blanching.Yet, after her hesitation, Arlecchino chose "at ease" as the codeword's meaning that day.Marelle was by then no longer associated with "danger." Now, all that came to mind when this game was mentioned were smiling faces.In which case, she thought, let those unhappy memories dwell in her heart alone. Let the blood and dust be wiped away, for should children not see a broader future?Vision Friendship Lv. 6  •  When the Hearth-Flame Goes Out
Arlecchino has many sources of power.The ancient Balemoon Bloodfire burns within her, the noble blood serving as both curse and blessing — this was her first support.The merciful Tsaritsa pardoned her matricide and granted her a Delusion, proof of royal favor and a badge of honor. That was the third time she obtained a source of power.Between these two, the girl who still called herself "Peruere" received a Vision.While Clervie yet lived, Peruere had mooted the idea of assassinating "Mother" to her. Perhaps she lacked confidence, or perhaps it was their familial bond that yet shackled her, but Clervie refused.Clervie's destiny concluded when the cold blade pierced her. But as she slipped away towards death, she was truly happy, for she had finally found her freedom.But for the living Peruere, fate's gears had only begun to turn.The experiment to select a "king" was over, but "Mother"'s ambitions were far from fulfilled.Peruere thus decided to undertake the plan that had once been shelved solo.From that day on, she silently calculated the gap between herself and "Mother." Her martial skills were the fruit of her "Mother"'s tutelage, and the strength flowing through her bloodline was laid bare before "Mother."And what was a child before adults but a nestling — even one who had emerged as ruler of the roost?But what her life of suffering up till now had not taught her was how to give up.Thus Peruere constantly honed herself, though her body became riddled with scars from constant battle, though her arms should be burned black from baleful blood-fire she could not completely control.Then, on one moonlit night, a Vision came to her without warning or portent.The round Vision lined up perfectly with the moon, and the glimmering gem tinted the latter crimson—Was this her wish?Was this merely the fruit of hundreds of days and nights of ceaseless thought?Such a question was doomed to remain unanswered, and so she did not obsess over it.She merely concealed the Vision in the place closest to her heart before sending "Mother" a "pleasant little surprise."As a Fatui Harbinger, Arlecchino bows before no god. Yet though it represents the institution of The Seven, she always takes meticulous care of this Vision.To her, this is proof of her defiance of fate, wresting from it command over her future.

The names of several of Arlecchino's Talents come from book titles.
Her normal attack Invitation to a Beheading is named after the Vladimir Nabokov novel Invitation to a Beheading.
Her "Masque of the Red Death" state is named after the Edgar Allen Poe short story Masque of the Red Death.
Arlecchino has unique walking and running animations compared to other tall female characters.
Arlecchino shares the same English voice actress, Erin Yvette, with Idyia.
Arlecchino's pet spider was named Bambi, a reference to the Disney film of the same name
Arlecchino, who has the title "Dire Balemoon" and ties to the Crimson Moon Dynasty[8] along with new and full moon imagery, was released shortly after April 2024's full moon, which happened during Version 4.6's Version Update maintenance.[9]
Coincidentally, a full moon in April is popularly known in English as the Pink Moon.
Arlecchino is also known by these aliases or titles:
The Fourth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers[10]
Regardless of the progress in the Archon Quest, her voice lines acknowledge the news of Signora's death and do not mention the Balladeer.
Arlecchino seems to have been designed to resemble the the character Sin Mal from Honkai Impact 3rd.
Sin Mal was also raised in an orphanage (Cocolia's orphanage), and has a lore connection to fire and bloodlust
Sin Mal's personality is different; she is arrogant and "enjoys spilling blood". Arlecchino seems much more reserved and in control of her bloodlust.
In commedia dell'arte, a type of Italian theater, "Arlecchino" (Harlequin) is an astute servant, often acting to thwart the plans of his master and pursuing his own love interest, Colombina, with wit and resourcefulness, often competing with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.
This seems to match with Tartaglia's belief that she'd turn against the Tsaritsa (her master) in a heartbeat if it benefited her.
The name Arlecchino derives from "Alichino," a demon that Dante places in the Divine Comedy as part of the Malebranche, a group of demons guarding the Bolgia of Barrators. Both Alichino and its English translation (harlequin), are in turn inspired by the demon Hellequin (also called Annequin, Hennequin or Hannequin), present in many legends and popular traditions of France and Provence.
One of Arlecchino's titles, "Otets," derives from the Russian word Отец Otets, "father."
Arlecchino's real name, Peruere, likely comes from the Latin, perurere, which means "to burn" or "to be consumed by fire."
The name is likely also a reference to the in-game novel, Hleobranto Innnamorato, in which the main character is named Perinheri.

HelloHelloMedia:VO_Arlecchino Hello.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_Hello.ogg I am The Knave, Arlecchino, Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers. The children of the House of the Hearth call me "Father." I do hope our partnership proves to be a pleasant one, although I would imagine that should be fairly easy. After all, there's no cause for contention between us at the moment... wouldn't you agree?
Chat: EyesChat: EyesMedia:VO_Arlecchino Chat - Eyes.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_Chat_-_Eyes.ogg Staring into my eyes is ill-advised. I can't promise you'll like what you see...
Chat: HomeChat: HomeMedia:VO_Arlecchino Chat - Home.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_Chat_-_Home.ogg What could the children be up to... Hmm. Never mind. Let them do as they please.

When Thunder StrikesWhen Thunder StrikesMedia:VO_Arlecchino When Thunder Strikes.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_When_Thunder_Strikes.ogg Fear not. What's a little thunder when even lightening [sic] wouldn't dare strike our path.
When It SnowsWhen It SnowsMedia:VO_Arlecchino When It Snows.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_When_It_Snows.ogg Only in the grip of winter do people truly appreciate the warmth of flames.
When the Sun Is OutWhen the Sun Is OutMedia:VO_Arlecchino When the Sun Is Out.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_When_the_Sun_Is_Out.ogg This kind of weather is more enjoyably spent under the cover of shade.
When the Wind Is BlowingWhen the Wind Is BlowingMedia:VO_Arlecchino When the Wind Is Blowing.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_When_the_Wind_Is_Blowing.ogg I would advise you to keep your secrets close to your chest. Divulge them too easily, and you never know where the wind might carry them.
Good MorningGood MorningMedia:VO_Arlecchino Good Morning.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_Good_Morning.ogg Good morning. Any plans for today?
Good AfternoonGood AfternoonMedia:VO_Arlecchino Good Afternoon.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_Good_Afternoon.ogg Whenever I return home at midday, I often find the children sprawled across the ground in the midst of sleep. A certain level of fatigue is common at this hour. Perhaps you, too, should rest a bit before we head out.
Good EveningGood EveningMedia:VO_Arlecchino Good Evening.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_Good_Evening.ogg It is said that the moon is like an eye gazing down upon the mortal plane. We have merely grown accustomed to its scrutiny.
Good NightGood NightMedia:VO_Arlecchino Good Night.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_Good_Night.ogg Time to retire for the night. Oh? "Can't sleep," you say? Well, I'm afraid you'll have to figure something out for yourself. I have a certain suspicion my solution won't be to your liking.
About Arlecchino: PerceptionAbout Arlecchino: PerceptionMedia:VO_Arlecchino About Arlecchino - Perception.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_Arlecchino_-_Perception.ogg Seeing yourself clearly is a difficult task indeed, perhaps even a thankless one. After all, they say those who lack adequate powers of self-perception often lead a happier existence.
About Arlecchino: Cold Blood Friendship Lv. 4About Arlecchino: Cold Blood Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arlecchino About Arlecchino - Cold Blood.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_Arlecchino_-_Cold_Blood.ogg On occasion, I hear others whisper in secret, calling me cold and cruel. People are free to believe as they wish, and I don't intend to clear up their misconceptions. Prejudice has a way of concealing the truth, and that is hardly to my disadvantage. Still, I believe the time has come for certain measures to be taken to "live up" to their expectations... Let's just hope those on the receiving end of these measures have enough power and status to escape with their lives.
About Us: CompromiseAbout Us: CompromiseMedia:VO_Arlecchino About Us - Compromise.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_Us_-_Compromise.ogg Our ideals are not entirely aligned. If we are to work together, we must be willing to compromise. To that end, I'm willing to share certain secrets with you. Information that I choose not to reveal, however, is best left unexplored... for your own good, of course.
About Us: Being a Guest Friendship Lv. 6About Us: Being a Guest Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Arlecchino About Us - Being a Guest.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_Us_-_Being_a_Guest.ogg The children simply adore your stories. They often ask me when you're coming around again. I do hope you won't let them down. Betraying their expectations comes with a price... Perhaps that's something worth your consideration.
About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4 When the Hearth-Flame Goes OutAbout the Vision Friendship Lv. 4 When the Hearth-Flame Goes OutMedia:VO_Arlecchino About the Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_the_Vision.ogg For the longest time, there wasn't anything I desired, until the idea came to me to assassinate Crucabena. It was a ludicrous thought then. She was a Harbinger, famed and experienced, and nearly everything I knew about fighting was taught by her hand.However, it appears you need only desire something with sufficient intensity, and the gods will answer. In the end, I gained a Vision, and after making certain sacrifices, I mastered this power. Surpassing one's teacher often requires the pursuit of the unexpected.
Something to ShareSomething to ShareMedia:VO_Arlecchino Something to Share.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_Something_to_Share.ogg "Flames course through my body like blood"... This may be nothing but a figure of speech to some. But for me, it's the harsh reality of my existence.
Interesting Things: AuroraInteresting Things: AuroraMedia:VO_Arlecchino Interesting Things - Aurora.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_Interesting_Things_-_Aurora.ogg The aurora in Snezhnaya is quite beautiful. Certainly worth a visit.
Interesting Things: Spiders Friendship Lv. 4Interesting Things: Spiders Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arlecchino Interesting Things - Spiders.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_Interesting_Things_-_Spiders.ogg I once had a pet spider named Bambi. Raising spiders is quite fascinating. They cannot be domesticated like cats or dogs. Any affection bestowed upon them will not be returned, and they require little investment in terms of care. It's the kind of relationship that suits me perfectly.
About Lyney Friendship Lv. 4 When the Hearth-Flame Goes OutAbout Lyney Friendship Lv. 4 When the Hearth-Flame Goes OutMedia:VO_Arlecchino About Lyney.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_Lyney.ogg Clervie once asked me what a "real home" looks like, but I had no answer for her. How could any of us know the answer when the House of the Hearth is made up entirely of people who never had a place to call home.By killing Crucabena, I was able to assume the identity of "Father" and rebuild the House under a new set of rules. Still, I'm well aware that, even with these efforts, the House is far from that ideal. As for what a real home truly looks like, I suppose that question is best put to the side for now... Perhaps one day, Lyney will be able to give me a new answer.
About Lynette Friendship Lv. 4About Lynette Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arlecchino About Lynette.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_Lynette.ogg Lynette's uniquely calm personality is also her strength, and I believe she is more than clever enough to recognize that. She is an irreplaceable part of that little team of three, and I would imagine that role brings her much joy. As her "Father," my duty is merely to give her the space to put those talents to good use.
About Freminet Friendship Lv. 4About Freminet Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arlecchino About Freminet.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_Freminet.ogg Freminet has a complex mind and often hides his emotions. He blames himself for things that aren't his doing and allows them to eat away at his conscience. I would imagine the other children might find it difficult to understand his manner of thinking, but you seem to share a similar delicate sensibility — perhaps you two would make good friends.
About Neuvillette Friendship Lv. 4About Neuvillette Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arlecchino About Neuvillette.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_Neuvillette.ogg Monsieur Neuvillette intentionally maintains a certain "distance" in professional and private settings. Many say this makes him cold and unfeeling, but I believe the truth is just the opposite. In order for all beings to be treated equally under the law, a certain level of emotional distance is expected. Maintaining that kind of indifference is, in itself, a demonstration of kindness.
About Furina Friendship Lv. 4 Masquerade of the GuiltyAbout Furina Friendship Lv. 4 Masquerade of the GuiltyMedia:VO_Arlecchino About Furina.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_Furina.ogg I asked Lyney to deliver an assortment of cakes for her theater troupe to enjoy during teatime. The children made the cakes themselves as a gesture to express the support and enthusiasm of her "audience." I do hope she enjoys them.
About the Tsaritsa Friendship Lv. 4About the Tsaritsa Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arlecchino About the Tsaritsa.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_the_Tsaritsa.ogg When I was imprisoned, it was the Tsaritsa who pardoned me and gave me the title of Harbinger. I could sense she was a person of true sincerity and compassion, unlike all those pompous hypocrites with their posturing and rhetoric. Yet... It's difficult to say whether her compassion alone is enough to melt the ice and snow that permeates her land. All I can say is this... If we are forced to be at odds one day, I will raise my weapon against her without hesitation, because that is the greatest level of respect I am able to bestow.
About The Jester Friendship Lv. 4About The Jester Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arlecchino About The Jester.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_The_Jester.ogg As the original Harbinger, much about him remains a mystery. Upon our first meeting, he recognized my background with ease, yet to this day, I know little about him.
About The Captain Friendship Lv. 4About The Captain Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arlecchino About The Captain.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_The_Captain.ogg He is very powerful, and that power comes with a high level of responsibility. However, I believe him to be someone worthy of respect independent of the power he holds.
About The Doctor Friendship Lv. 4About The Doctor Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arlecchino About The Doctor.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_The_Doctor.ogg When I first took over the House of the Hearth, he proposed a number of plans for us to work together. He wanted me to send any "rejects" to him. He planned to experiment on them and then share the results with me. I heard that he and the previous Knave had quite the professional rapport in that regard. All I can say is that, if he weren't one of my fellow Harbingers, I would have expedited their happy, little reunion long ago.
About Damselette Friendship Lv. 4About Damselette Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arlecchino About Damselette.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_Damselette.ogg She is a very special Harbinger. Pose her a question, and the answer you receive will be entirely unpredictable, if she sees fit to give a proper answer at all. Regardless, any answer you do receive is sure to be an interesting one.
About The Rooster Friendship Lv. 4About The Rooster Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arlecchino About The Rooster.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_The_Rooster.ogg The Rooster holds little love for me, and the feeling is mutual. He is an acceptable mayor, I suppose... perhaps even an exceptional one. He has an uncanny ability to make great gains at a small price, which has earned him substantial acclaim throughout his political circles. However "small" the price may be, if it continues to come at the expense of my organization, sooner or later... Hmph.
About Marionette Friendship Lv. 4About Marionette Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arlecchino About Marionette.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_Marionette.ogg I have little interest in her. She is extremely... passionate about her research and does not appear in public often. In fact, many of our officers have yet to see her at all. Compared to, let's say, someone who would go so far as to create segments of themselves to better wander across the land, I suppose you could say she is at the other end of the extreme.
About Regrator Friendship Lv. 4About Regrator Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arlecchino About Regrator.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_Regrator.ogg I won't deny that he is a capable and imaginative individual, but he lacks "clarity." He can formulate grand plans and manipulate the economy with ease, yet at the same time, he allows his actions to be governed by the vengeance and hatred locked in the depths of his heart. Rational people often believe themselves capable of controlling their emotions, but I believe that confidence is their greatest weakness.
About The Fair Lady Friendship Lv. 4About The Fair Lady Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arlecchino About The Fair Lady.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_The_Fair_Lady.ogg She and Pierro were the first Harbingers I became acquainted with. Her prideful attitude when she first visited the House of the Hearth failed to earn her many friends among the children. Subsequent visits were accompanied by gifts and the stately claim that "those who dislike me shall receive none." The children quickly learned how to play pretend, and she in turn basked in their attention, superficial though it may have been. I imagine she quite enjoyed being surrounded by children, perhaps due to the persistent loneliness that plagued her... I found her sacrifice to be a great shame. May she be reunited with her lover in death.
About Childe Friendship Lv. 4About Childe Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Arlecchino About Childe.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_About_Childe.ogg Objectively speaking, his personality is ill-suited to that of a Harbinger. He often tries to think the best of others... and finds himself used by them as a result. Of course, he is very talented. With time, I'm sure he'll come into his own. I see no need to judge him too early.

Why, of course. Our relationship is one of mutual trust. There's little need to keep things hidden... I would only inquire as to whether you're truly prepared for what you might learn. Secrets can be sharper than a knife. Innocent curiosity can lead to dangerous places.

Some people have an air of renown and distinction, yet grovel and plead for their lives when faced with death — their outward demeanor nothing more than a hollow facade. Others appear unremarkable, yet carry a heavy burden within. Despite the factors that differentiate us in life... death awaits us all — the great and final equalizer. Cruel, you say? I merely state the truth.

I will do my utmost to teach them how to navigate life. The House of the Hearth begs favors from no one — like a spider, we hunt for what we want.
More About Arlecchino: IV Friendship Lv. 5 When the Hearth-Flame Goes OutMore About Arlecchino: IV Friendship Lv. 5 When the Hearth-Flame Goes OutMedia:VO_Arlecchino More About Arlecchino - 04.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_More_About_Arlecchino_-_04.ogg No one has the power to choose where they come from, but we all have the right to fight for the life we want. In this sense, the world is both unfair and just in equal measure. I don't take in children out of a desire for recompense. In fact, should they so wish, the children are free to leave and pursue a life outside my organization... so long as they're willing to pay the price.
More About Arlecchino: V Friendship Lv. 6More About Arlecchino: V Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Arlecchino More About Arlecchino - 05.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_More_About_Arlecchino_-_05.ogg Fate can be a peculiar thing. When I was young, "Mother" favored me due to the unusual set of abilities I possess. No one was able to discern their true nature, not even me. We could only speculate that they were the result of some sort of hereditary curse. Whatever the origin of my power, all I knew was that it was the source of my strength, and often the impetus for my suffering. It was only after I became a Harbinger that I finally learned the truth from The Jester. He expressed surprise that the Crimson Moon bloodline had not gone extinct, and that, in a strange twist of fate, the House of the Hearth had ended up in the hands of an orphan of that lineage once again.I cannot say what the future holds. I trust fate will give me an answer in time, and when it does, I'm prepared to do things my way, even if that means striking down fate with my own two hands.
Arlecchino's HobbiesArlecchino's HobbiesMedia:VO_Arlecchino Hobbies.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_Hobbies.ogg In my free time, I enjoy observing insects in the forest. The dynamics between them are fascinating — the way they hunt for food, compete with each other, even cooperate... Those that seem formidable aren't always the ones that make it until the end, and a single error can prove fatal. I observe their struggle as they near death, and slowly commit the image of their suffering to memory, much like I do for those that fall by my own hand.
Arlecchino's Troubles Masquerade of the GuiltyArlecchino's Troubles Masquerade of the GuiltyMedia:VO_Arlecchino Troubles.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_Troubles.ogg The children often make use of words and phrases from popular vernacular that are only comprehensible among themselves, much like the codewords we use during missions. Of course, children often need their own space, and I fully understand that.
Favorite FoodFavorite FoodMedia:VO_Arlecchino Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_Favorite_Food.ogg On occasion, we hold barbecue dinners at the House, and the children prepare the ingredients themselves. They enjoy participating in activities like that, and the feeling is mutual. After all, it's always possible certain familiar faces will be missing from the crowd the next time a similar event rolls around.
Least Favorite FoodLeast Favorite FoodMedia:VO_Arlecchino Least Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Arlecchino_Least_Favorite_Food.ogg I dislike complex seasonings. They dull one's sense of smell and taste. Allowing the ingredients to maintain their original flavor is also a way to respect their integrity.

Birthdays should be lively occasions. It's always nice to have an excuse to set formal matters aside every now and then, whether it's for the purpose of celebrating yourself or others. Come. I've prepared a feast for you at the House of the Hearth. Let's not keep the children waiting.

OverviewLoreVoice-OversOutfitsCompanionGallery
Arlecchino can be invited as a Companion into the player's Serenitea Pot after obtaining her and completing the World Quest Idle Teapot Talk.
If a character's favorite furnishing set is placed in the same realm as the character for the first time, the character will automatically teleport to the furnishing set. Interacting with the character will initiate a special dialogue, after which the character will teleport back to their original position.

Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo hello 01.ogg Arlecchino: It's my turn to play the guest, I see. A novel turn of events.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo hello 02.ogg Arlecchino: I shall follow your lead, and play the good visitor.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Arlecchino: Thank you for inviting me to this realm. This has proved a fine vacation spot.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Arlecchino: Is a transfer of ownership on the cards, by any chance?
 You want to buy the Serenitea Pot?
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Arlecchino: No need to startle. This is a quiet and secure location, shielded from outside disturbances. It would make for a good backup base.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Arlecchino: Any object that could solve many problems is worth paying a fair price for.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Arlecchino: An unfortunate answer, but not an unexpected one.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Arlecchino: This resembles a "home" more than it does a base. Let us keep it that way, then.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship1 07.ogg Arlecchino: Is something the matter?
 Want to hold a "family barbecue"?
 All the children from the House of the Hearth would be welcome to come.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship1 08.ogg Arlecchino: A fine suggestion. This space is sufficiently large for a family gathering.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship1 09.ogg Arlecchino: The children will be glad to have the chance to visit and play at a friend's place. It is agreed, then... as for the costs of this gathering, simply leave it to me.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Arlecchino: That seems agreeable. Is there anything you would like to discuss?
 Actually, nothing's coming to mind...
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Arlecchino: The children often say so too.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Arlecchino: "I'm not sure what to say to 'Father,' what sort of topic I should go with..." I hear such discussions often.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Arlecchino: In truth, talking to me is not very difficult. I can make conversation on most topics.
 (Discuss the aquabus's design principles.)
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 05a 1.ogg Arlecchino: This is quite a specific engineering question. Your interest is unexpected.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 05a 2.ogg Arlecchino: The internal structure of an aquabus contains a number of intricate clockwork components, which allow it to be powered by different energy sources.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 05a 3.ogg Arlecchino: I've also heard that during the aquabus's initial trial run, some passengers sent in feedback indicating that they would prefer a more unique look for the vessel.
 Wow, I would have never guessed...
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 05a 4.ogg Arlecchino: Some suggested that the vessels adopt an Angelic Sea Hare-like design, but this was rejected due to considerations for the vehicle's overall capabilities.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 05a 5.ogg Arlecchino: If you would like to hear more about the history of the aquabus, I could arrange for a "friend" from the Fontaine Research Institute to explain it to you — during a boat ride, of course.
 (Discuss the art of selecting desserts.)
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 05b 1.ogg Arlecchino: Ah. It appears you quite enjoyed my choice of desserts for Miss Furina's table.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 05b 2.ogg Arlecchino: There are many tricks to choosing treats. The key is having a sufficient "understanding" of everything.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 05b 3.ogg Arlecchino: The varieties of the treats, their stores of origin, the artisanship of their creators, as well as how they're plated and presented... Each of these factors builds upon the others. Still more intelligence is required if you are making this purchase on the behalf of another.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 05b 4.ogg Arlecchino: Their personalities, relationships, current situations, and long-held preferences... There is no one-size-fits-all answer.
 That sounds... really complicated.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 05b 5.ogg Arlecchino: A novice would find it difficult, yes, but experience is cumulative. Start at buying gifts for friends and go from there.
 (Chat about the latest opera production.)
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 05c 1.ogg Arlecchino: "The Unexpected Dream," you mean? I found it a mature production, a tale about love that blossomed through all manner of strange coincidences and circumstances.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 05c 2.ogg Arlecchino: I watched the premiere. The actors were not sufficiently rehearsed, and incidents you'd expect from an unpolished production did occur, but the audience laughed and cheered them on all the same.
 I've heard that they've brought on a famous actress to the upcoming show.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 05c 3.ogg Arlecchino: That is indeed the case. If you are familiar with opera, you should know her. She was the protagonist in "Romaritime Romance" as well — you could say that she's at the peak of her career right now.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 05c 4.ogg Arlecchino: The fourth run of performances should start the day after tomorrow. If you're interested, I can invite you to come along.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Arlecchino: Is there anything else you'd like to ask?
 Wow, you really can hold a conversation on just about anything!
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Arlecchino: But of course. Finding common topics and ground are indispensable assets in building interpersonal relations.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Arlecchino: The work of intelligence gathering merits preparation, but it would be unwise to pin all one's hopes on intel. As such, I try to dabble in as many fields as I can to gain more knowledge.
 Doesn't that get dry after a while?
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Arlecchino: Just the opposite. The more I learn, the more clearly I see how the world operates, and the easier it becomes to lead an elegant life.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Arlecchino: You must first take care of yourself before caring for others. Knowledge and skill broaden your options.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship2 11.ogg Arlecchino: If you have something you wish to share, feel free to come look for me. As long as nothing confidential is involved, I'm sure it will make for a wonderful chat.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Arlecchino: The weather is good, as is the wind. Let us go for a walk.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Arlecchino: There are two sights I enjoy more than most — the sea by day, and the skies by night.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Arlecchino: When I need to think, the former would be my choice. If I am in a good mood, then I will favor the latter.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship3 04a 1.ogg Arlecchino: I've rarely seen a Fontainian, native or adopted, not profess a fondness for the waves.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship3 04a 2.ogg Arlecchino: It is full of mystery and peril, but also accepts all manner of wishes. Furthermore... the sea is vast, vast enough to serve as a repository for many kinds of frustrations.
 Hmm... so are you saying that gazing at the sea can improve your mood?
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship3 04a 3.ogg Arlecchino: No, I meant something more... literal than that. Namely, that the sea can make things that disgust you disappear, never to emerge again.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship3 04a 4.ogg Arlecchino: It is good for secrets that should never see the light of day to sink to the forgotten depths.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship3 04a 5.ogg Arlecchino: Only when your gaze can pierce through the sea's shimmering surface and look into its frigid depths, will you truly understand the truth of this world.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship3 04b 1.ogg Arlecchino: Hmm... I suppose I could share a story from a long time ago.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship3 04b 2.ogg Arlecchino: When I was young, I once had a dream. In it, I stood on a vast plain, with a red moon hanging in the sky.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship3 04b 3.ogg Arlecchino: The moon rotated gradually, and as I stared at it, it, too, watched me silently.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship3 04b 4.ogg Arlecchino: I cannot describe what it was like to be the object of its gaze, so filled with death and grief... Or was it fear and pity? It has been too long, and my memories of it have faded.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship3 04b 5.ogg Arlecchino: I wish to know as well, but the truth will not simply present itself to me.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship3 04b 6.ogg Arlecchino: Perhaps I shall one day witness that dreamscape once more, or perhaps I never will. Just as you and I may cross blades one day — or perhaps our relations will remain ever amiable.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo friendship3 04b 7.ogg Arlecchino: The allure of the future lies in its uncertainty. Regardless, let us lay our worries aside and enjoy this fine breeze.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo morning 01.ogg Arlecchino: And to you. Ah, yes. Before turning in for the night, I noticed some corners of the realm that had not been cleaned for some time.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo morning 02.ogg Arlecchino: You should see to that once the opportunity presents itself.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo night 01.ogg Arlecchino: Indeed. I was getting ready to retire myself.
Media:vo arlecchino mimitomo night 02.ogg Arlecchino: An early night is a balm for exhaustion, and presages a productive tomorrow.
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.
Media:vo mimitomo fd arlecchino residentarea 01.ogg Arlecchino: Many see me as a solitary, mysterious person.
Media:vo mimitomo fd arlecchino residentarea 02.ogg Arlecchino: In truth, I do not mind mingling with the crowd. People-watching is also one of my interests.
Media:vo mimitomo fd arlecchino residentarea 03.ogg Arlecchino: Of course, whether those in the crowd would enjoy seeing me... is a completely different matter.
Media:vo mimitomo fd arlecchino stagestyle 01.ogg Arlecchino: If the world could be likened to a stage, then everyone must find their own place.
Media:vo mimitomo fd arlecchino stagestyle 02.ogg Arlecchino: I believe myself better suited to the audience stands. What about you?
Media:vo mimitomo fd arlecchino stagestyle 03.ogg Arlecchino: Would you sit by my side, or would you prefer to take the stage?
