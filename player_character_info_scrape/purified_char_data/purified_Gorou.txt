The great general of Watatsumi Island's forces. He has gained respect and prestige, but always shows himself to be a humble leader.He is deeply trusted by his subordinates and is someone with whom you can share your feelings without shame.—Description from the Official Website[1]
The great general of Watatsumi Island's forces. He is deeply trusted by his subordinates.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Gorou, like all of Watatsumi Island's inhabitants, is a loyal supporter of Sangonomiya Kokomi. Kokomi trusts him to lead the Watatsumi Army as its primary general, being sincere, determined and courageous. He has a strong sense of camaraderie and gets along well with all of the soldiers under his command, who in turn share the same sentiment and speak to him if any issues arise, including new recruits.[2] Kazuha describes Gorou as a person who says what is on his mind, uninhibited by others' feelings.[3]
In the heat of battle, Kokomi remarks that Gorou tends to have a habit of letting the adrenaline rush to his head, often requiring someone to keep him in check when he heads to the battlefield. While he considers himself to be mostly inexperienced due to his age, he tries his best to help out with any problems that may arise. He is comfortable speaking with others apart from Yae Miko, as the kitsune enjoys messing with him that he instinctively hides from her if given the chance.
Gorou has dog blood in his veins and shares several of their traits, including the ability to mostly understand what they are saying from a single bark. His ears also twitch accordingly depending on what emotion is evoked. If he is particularly happy, his tail begins wagging, something that he considers embarrassing, yet is unable to control and is sometimes oblivious to. He also wishes to be taller and more muscular so that his soldiers can identify him easily on the battlefield.
He is fond of sweets due to their rarity in military life, but avoids onions as they make his eyes tear up. This once lead to him crying in front of his men, greatly embarrassing him. He is also fond of mountaineering as it builds strength and camaraderie, expressing a desire to scale Liyue's mountains if he gets the chance to travel there.

Gorou uses the medium male model. He has fair skin, light orange-brown hair with a white section, and teal blue eyes. He has erect pointy ears that are white inside and a bushy tail with a white underside.
A trusted general who will guide his loyal men into any battle
Kindness and loyalty are the representation of virtue. Without a doubt, my friend Gorou is a virtuous general.—Kaedehara Kazuha
A loyal and brave general of Watatsumi island. Born with a beast-like fighting intuition and tenacious will, he can find a way to victory even in the most critical moments.
He leads the Watatsumi troops, who have far fewer military resources compared to the Shogunate. Gorou strives to ensure that the inhabitants of this island will live in safety and peace.
Outsiders may not be able to imagine that Gorou, someone who faced thousands of enemies on the battlefield, is actually very affable and gets along with all his subordinates.
In Gorou's eyes, the people around him are not only his brave soldiers, they are also his beloved companions. They are like treasure to be cared for and protected. The land that sustains us, the comrades who support us, the faith that encourages us to move forward... These are the most precious things for Gorou, to whom he devotes his loyalty and courage.
Within Gorou exists a soul as vast and reliable as the earth.
Gorou is the great general of Watatsumi Island's military, and he is deeply loved by his subordinates.During the period of the Vision Hunt Decree, Gorou led the forces of Watatsumi against the Shogun's Army, and successfully held the line against them.The troops call him the "ever-victorious pointy-eared general," a nickname that has also seen broad use among Shogunate warriors.In private, however, Gorou puts on no airs and is a straightforward person, which has led him to be regarded by all as the man with the plan.But even such an exemplary general must have his fair share of troubles...Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Gorou was once an ordinary Watatsumi soldier.During a certain special operation, Gorou's unit, Gorgasia II, faced an unprecedented crisis.Their captain had been felled by a stray arrow, and the survivors were surrounded deep in the mountains.To continue their mission, to ask for reinforcements, to open negotiations with the enemy... Countless choices lay before them, but the mountain was silent.Leaderless and without any supplies, the unit was on its last legs. With their morale flagging, thoughts of surrender shrouded many minds.At this critical moment, Gorou stood up. He rejected negotiation and surrender, and instead proposed a bold plan.They would not hide any longer. Instead, he would lead the larger part of the platoon in a feigned attack to buy the others a chance to call for reinforcements. Once those reinforcements arrived, they could perform a pincer attack together.When asked what they should do if they failed, Gorou replied:"If the enemy surrounds us any further, our options will be even more limited. The way I see it, we still have a chance, so we've got to give it all we've got.""I'll take responsibility if the plan fails."After holding the line for several days without rest, the exhausted Gorou and his companions were finally relieved by a force led by Sangonomiya Kokomi herself.After that, he was promoted to serve as the captain of Gorgasia II, and from there he would work his way up to the rank of General.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
In the eyes of the men, Gorou is a strict but humble general.He is straightforward and easy-going, and he treats his subordinates like his own family, sharing weal and woe with them.Sangonomiya Kokomi once told Gorou that material, supplies, and salaries were the three most important things to an army.From that day on, he would personally explain weapon maintenance to his subordinates. Every time the granaries were opened, he would supervise the process strictly to prevent any unlawful deductions.And as General Gorou, he will always lead from the front.The sight of him charging at the tip of the spear is like a rallying banner, encouraging the troops behind him to continue advancing.These are all reasons why the troops greatly respect him. As with Kokomi, Gorou greatly treasures the lives of his troops, but by contrast, values his own quite little.Some who understand little of the thought process behind this occasionally joke that Gorou is a "kid" who doesn't seem like a general at all.But to the soldiers of Watatsumi Island, this kid is the best general they could ask for.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Gorou is valiant and decisive, often leading inferior forces to victory over superior opposition.However, he does have a shortcoming of his own — a sometimes unstable temper.That is to say that the blood sometimes rushes to his head at the height of a battle.War is cruel, and Gorou does indeed lack experience compared to veterans who have been scrapping it out on battlefields for decades.Fortunately, he learns fast and is currently trying to make up for his various small failings.Sangonomiya Kokomi often provides her various commanders with directives, but how they are used is up to the skill of the commander in question.For his part, Gorou is always able to execute the courses of action that best suit the present situation from the directives he has been given.Gorou believes that over time, he will come to internalize the concepts behind them. Perhaps then, he can take the field with even more confidence than before.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
At Yae Miko's request, Gorou has taken up a certain extra "job" at Yae Publishing House.With the end of the Vision Hunt Decree, and the successful negotiations between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate, relations between the two sides are beginning to warm.Gorou has also visited Narukami Island quite a few times to check out the changes, buy a few popular books, and go to Yae Publishing House to complete the task he agreed to help with.Yae Miko set up an anonymous column for Gorou in the "That's Life" magazine. Here, readers will write about the things that trouble them and send them to Yae Publishing House, upon which Gorou will give them some suggestions.Yae Publishing House will take special care to redact any personal information revealed on the part of the write-ins or Gorou's replies, and will replace real names with pseudonyms.According to Yae Miko, she chose him because she'd heard that he often listened to his subordinates when they chatted about personal matters.The column proved to be very popular indeed, but for whatever reason, every time an editor delivers the royalties to Gorou, they might sheepishly ask:"Ah, speaking of which, Gorou, have you heard of Ms. Hina?""I've heard that she's a rather popular columnist, and a recent one, too. Is something the matter?""Oh, no, no... It's nothing..."Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Just as the troops don't exactly tell Gorou everything happening in their lives, Gorou, too, has some troubles that are difficult to share.For example, how his tail fur starts to get dull and look haggard after being exposed to the elements for too long, and how he'd love to tend to it — if he could only spare the time out in the field.Or how he sometimes feels a bit inferior about his slight physique when bathing together with his subordinates.Or about how encountering inscrutable women like Yae Miko sends him into defense mode instantly, rendering him unable to properly interact with them...In trying to maintain a respectable image, Gorou refrains from telling his soldiers about such troubles.And while they have been able to guess at his troubles to some extent, the Watatsumi soldiers often just play along and pretend that they don't notice.As such, his worries just kept piling up, until the Traveler arrived, thus granting the Watatsumi general, ever good at banishing the worries of others, someone who could help relieve him of his own woes.Mountaineering Gear Friendship Lv. 4
Of Gorou's various hobbies, "mountaineering" is likely up there in the top three.Sweating it out while climbing a mountain with companions before admiring the beauty all around you helps to train both the mind and body and is a great camaraderie-builder.To better enjoy this hobby of his, Gorou bought a set of mountaineering gear from a traveling merchant.The set is not particularly pricey, but it is both sturdy and durable and has seen Gorou through many dangerous ascents.Just as he maintains his weapons well, Gorou has also kept this set of gear in tip-top shape. There is little doubt that it will accompany him through many future journeys as well.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
There was a time when Gorou ascribed responsibility for victory or loss in battle entirely to himself."If only I became a little stronger, perhaps I'd be able to turn the tide."It was in this spirit that Gorou trained his archery day and night, hoping to rely on his strength to lead his comrades to victory.But after some time on the battlefield, Gorou saw powerful warriors being isolated and captured alive, while weak troops in inferior positions could rout their enemies through unity.That was when Gorou realized that a single person's battlefield capabilities are limited.Getting stronger is important, naturally, but uniting the troops to fight as one is even more crucial.A troop can only be unbeatable if they are strong together.Having realized this, Gorou no longer pursued the apex of excellence in archery, but instead invested time and effort in those around him, helping everyone improve together.Thinking back on it, this may have opened the door for Gorou to obtain his Vision.

Gorou's English voice actor, Cory Yee, also voices Draff, Huffman, Six-Fingered José, ???, Farrah, and the Abyss Lectors.
After Gorou was employed for Yae Publishing House's "That's Life" column, Miko developed the pen name "Ms. Hina" for Gorou without telling him to boost the column's sales. Ms. Hina's appearance depicted on a pamphlet and standee strongly resembles a female version of Gorou, with the Ms. Hina Fan Club mistaking Gorou as her blood relative. Gorou is aware of Ms. Hina's existence, but does not realize that "Ms. Hina" is his pen name, nor that the visual design is based on him.[4][5]
Ms. Hina has gained some popularity in the Fortress of Meropide.[6]
Gorou is known by these aliases or titles:
Top Dog Gorou ("Big/Elder Brother Gorou" in Chinese, Japanese and Korean)
Gorou's aversion to onion is a reference to how dogs are unable to consume onions as it is poisonous to them.
Gorou's ears, tail, and hair color are reminiscent of the Shiba Inu, a breed of hunting dog from Japan.
Gorou is seen wielding the ascended version of the Raven Bow in his portrait art.
Gorou is mentioned in the descriptions of the following 2 Furnishings: Camp Bow-Rack: Fletching Mt. Yougou Night Walk Red Kitsune Doll
Gorou (Japanese: 五郎) is a Japanese name traditionally given to fifth-born sons.
Kujou Sara has remarked on how she has heard that he is a fifth-born son.[7]
His name may also be a reference to the samurai Shiba Gorou (Japanese: 柴五郎), as Gorou is designed after a shiba inu.
The second part of his name in Chinese (Chinese: 郎 láng) is pronounced identically to the word for wolf (Chinese: 狼 láng).
Coincidentally, the Japanese reading of the first part of Gorou's name (Japanese: 五 go) sounds similar to the Chinese word for dog (Chinese: 狗 gǒu).

Now there's even a rumor going around saying that "if you want Top Dog Gorou's victorious luck, give his pointy ears a rub." Grrr, there will be no rubbing of my ears, and that's final. If they think they can smile their way into persuading me otherwise, well, they've got another thing... Hmm? Hey, wh—what are you doing? Not you too...? Come on now, I... I thought I... Mm.... Mm...

About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Gorou About Beidou.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Gorou_About_Beidou.ogg Captain Beidou values camaraderie, and her exceptional abilities command respect. She once said that she prefers to avoid involving her companions in disputes that don't concern them, which I can completely understand. That's why I only request her help when we have no one else to turn to.

He's like a gust of wind that sweeps through the land. Though he never stays for long, he is always able to contribute something to those who are around him. When I fought alongside him, I learned more about what it means to be truly carefree and without constraints. In any case, I think that Kazuha and I make a great team together!

It is then my duty to put every detail of the plan into action and to keep the situation under control on the front line. We are united with the whole resistance in achieving a single purpose: victory.

Without her ingenious and insightful strategies, the resistance could never have come as far as it has today. But if you ask me, it seems that deep down she prefers a much quieter existence. So when there's no pressing military matters, I try not to disturb her too much.

I could never bring myself to accept her past actions, no matter what her reasoning may have been. Though a peace treaty has been signed between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate, I refuse to let my guard down. If conflict ever breaks out again, I will resume my place back on the front line.

We've met each other countless times in battle, emerging both victorious and defeated at different times. *sigh* I know now that it's not realistic to think this way, but I did use to wonder what things would be like if those like her could value the wishes of the people and be free from the grip of the Shogunate.

I'd prefer not to talk about her. Can we change the topic? Or, if there are any tasks I can take off your hand, I'll gladly oblige! Anything at all? ...Ahem, let's just say it'd be best for my general well-being if we can we avoid talking about her...

In fact, the Shirasagi Himegimi has managed to establish an excellent reputation for herself, despite facing pressure from both sides. I suppose she must know how to keep her composure at all times and navigate sensitive situations tactfully... There's much I could learn from her.
About Sayu Friendship Lv. 4About Sayu Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Gorou About Sayu.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Gorou_About_Sayu.ogg Hmm, according to our intel, she is a ninja proficient in the art of infiltration — a skill set which could prove very useful in some of Her Excellency's special operations... However, our intel also indicates that she could be difficult to recruit as she is rather unruly, and often disappears without a trace. Hmm? She's with the Yashiro Commission? Oh, well forget it then.

Well, no one from the Shogunate can be fully trusted, so I'll be keeping my eyes and ears on him! On a separate note, he does have some talent for investigation. But how can we know that this isn't all part of some nefarious scheme? Hmm. Only time will tell, I suppose.

Countless battles in, I'm still here, so I guess these hands and my will to survive were both strong enough to see me through. Some even say that no matter how dire the battle may be, everyone will emerge unscathed as long as they follow me. And with that, I've somehow gained enough reputation among our forces to become the leader that I am now.

But then, everything changed when the Raiden Shogun enacted the Vision Hunt Decree. The Shogun's Army marched up expecting to put us in our place, but we were ready for them, and we hit them hard. Hehe, I bet they never expected to meet such fierce resistance.

I tend to get too engrossed in battle, fighting deep into enemy lines and forgetting about everything else. She told me that my bravery is commendable, but as a ranking officer, it's not my place to do this. I'm doing my best to improve, but... Would you also be able to keep an eye on me?

No, we fight against a destructive malice — a malice that has trampled the aspirations of the people and destroyed the peaceful lives they once knew. After I rid the land of such evil I will be able to peacefully lay down my weapon. Only then will I trade my uniform for civilian attire... and finally stroll the beautiful landscape of Watatsumi Island together with you.
Gorou's HobbiesGorou's HobbiesMedia:VO_Gorou Hobbies.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Gorou_Hobbies.ogg I love mountain climbing! The steeper, the better. Climbing trains my body and mind, making me stronger with every grip and every foothold. Better yet is climbing mountains with fellow companions. After hours of dirt and sweat scaling the summit, we can sit down and enjoy the view together. It's one of life's greatest joys! Ahem, however, I have absolutely no desire to scale the tallest peak in Inazuma...

Favorite FoodFavorite FoodMedia:VO_Gorou Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Gorou_Favorite_Food.ogg My favorites are cake and Tricolor Dango, probably because I seldom get the chance to enjoy the luxury of sweets. The rations we have in the field are intended to be simple, effective, and quick, and are seldom served with any seasonings at all, let alone sugar... It's probably the most precious commodity of all. Ah, what can I say — I guess I just have a sweet tooth!
Least Favorite FoodLeast Favorite FoodMedia:VO_Gorou Least Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Gorou_Least_Favorite_Food.ogg I'll pretty much eat anything, but onions are an exception.

The soldiers from logistics felt terrible about it, too.

Media:vo gorou mimitomo hello 02.ogg Gorou: So what's up, everything alright?
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Gorou: Yeah, you bet! Don't worry, I'm exceedingly good at adapting to new environments.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Gorou: There've been times in the past when I've had to make do with a rock for a pillow, or just find a patch of grass to lie down on. In the army, you learn how to sleep well wherever you are.
 So do you feel that life here is too relaxed?
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship1 03a 1.ogg Gorou: Haha, why would you think that?
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship1 03a 2.ogg Gorou: If your bowstring is always drawn tight, it will eventually snap.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship1 03a 3.ogg Gorou: Relaxation is an essential part of improving as a fighter. So as far as I'm concerned, this place is the perfect antidote to the tension of battle!
 Well, you can finally take it easy here...
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship1 03b 1.ogg Gorou: *sigh*... Seems so.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship1 03b 2.ogg Gorou: Time of peace is hard to come by. I will cherish every moment of it.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Gorou: Which brings me to you. I wanted to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude for everything you've done for me. Thank you!
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Gorou: You've always been genuine with me, it truly warms my heart.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Gorou: Anyway, don't worry, I'm not here to just take advantage and lounge around. I'm ready to switch to combat mode at a moment's notice!
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Gorou: Sure!
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Gorou: How about I tell you some stories from my time in the resistance? I can think of a few you're not likely to hear from anybody else...
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Gorou: Alright! The truth is, not every soldier that joins the resistance goes through formal training, so new soldiers make small mistakes from time to time.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Gorou: For example, one time during a mock expedition, one of the new soldiers didn't store his rations carefully enough. They went bad, and he ended up eating nothing but Radishes for two whole weeks.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Gorou: Another time during a scouting operation, a new soldier mistook animal trails for enemy trails. They ended up playing cat and mouse with a forest boar for three whole days...
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Gorou: Thankfully, these were just small oversights, and never caused any serious consequences. On the contrary, we often have a good laugh about these things during our down time.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Gorou: But when I think about it, I'm sure we would avoid issues like these if we reformed some of our guidelines.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Gorou: We should be mixing veteran soldiers and newer soldiers together. This way, veteran soldiers can act as mentors and share their experience with the newer soldiers...
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Gorou: Uh, my apologies, I began thinking out loud there!
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Gorou: I can go over these reforms some other time! Right now, I'm chatting with you, so I should keep it light.
 I want to hear more about the Ever-Victorious General.

Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship2 13.ogg Gorou: Soldiers love boasting about my military achievements to other people, but I always feel that talking about my own experience gives the impression I'm boasting.
 I would never think you're boasting.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship2 14.ogg Gorou: Heh, you know I can't say no to you, don't you? ...Wait, that's why you asked, isn't it?
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship2 15.ogg Gorou: Heh... Alright, I guess there's no way out of this one...
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship2 16.ogg Gorou: Let me think... Okay, let me tell you the thrilling tale of my one-man scouting mission to the north of Nazuchi Beach.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship2 17.ogg Gorou: Here's what I remember from that day...
 Is there anything you'd like to do?
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Gorou: Yeah! I heard from Tubby the Butler Bird that she can change the terrain to whatever you want.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Gorou: So, could you build a really tall mountain? The steeper the better — I want it to be a tough climb.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Gorou: Then, let's you and I have a race to the top!
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Gorou: Wow, you didn't take much persuading! Thank you!
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Gorou: I used to go mountain climbing with my resistance comrades all the time. It was a great way to test our physical limits while also having some fun together... I have so many treasured memories.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Gorou: But something tells me that the chance to climb a mountain with you would become the happiest memory of them all.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Gorou: In fact, I would love to share every happy moment with you.
 Gorou, I also want to thank you.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Gorou: Hah, you're too kind! Alright... how about we find a relatively safe mountain trail and see who makes it to the top the fastest? Are you up to the challenge!?
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Gorou: The loser has to treat the winner to a three-course meal... and at least one of the courses has to be dessert...
 I... just want to touch your tail...
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship3 10a 1.ogg Gorou: Uh? What a weird request...
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship3 10a 2.ogg Gorou: But, fine... if you win, of course!
 "I want to use your tail as a pillow when I go to sleep...
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship3 10b 1.ogg Gorou: What!? My tail... as a pillow...
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship3 10b 2.ogg Gorou: I... Fine, I'll allow it. But only if you win.
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Gorou: For the sake of my tail, I will give it everything I got! If you're serious about winning this, you're gonna have your work cut out for you!
Media:vo gorou mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Gorou: Right! We should probably warm up first...
