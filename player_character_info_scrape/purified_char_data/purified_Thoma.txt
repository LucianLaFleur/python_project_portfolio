The housekeeper of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, and a well-known "fixer" in Inazuma.Friendly and approachable, Thoma fits in with the crowd easily wherever he is.At first glance, he seems to be a very easygoing person, but he is in fact very responsible. He has an extraordinarily serious side, be it in his work or his interpersonal communications.—Description from the Official Website[1]
The Kamisato Clan's housekeeper. A well-known "fixer" in Inazuma.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Thoma is known by Inazumans to be a "helper" — helping everyone out and ensuring that any issues are quickly and peacefully resolved.
The son of an Inazuman father and Mondstadter mother, Thoma shares the traits seen in both nations' peoples; his father placed a great emphasis on loyalty, while being raised in Mondstadt meant that he could easily mingle with most people. He believes that people should happily enjoy a leisurely life and does not particularly care about his reputation, even if people speak ill of him. He originally went to Inazuma to bring his father Dandelion Wine, but after falling overboard, he ended up in Inazuma with no connections and no Mora. Despite the dangers he faced at the time, Thoma was able to make the most of his situation and eventually obtained the Kamisato Clan's trust. He is an efficient worker, resolving all of the Kamisato Clan's issues in a timely order.[2]
He places great loyalty on the Kamisato Clan. Despite his easy-going appearance, he shows no mercy to those who threaten the Kamisato siblings and the Yashiro Commission. He does not use his connections for personal gains.
Thoma uses the tall male model. He has green eyes, fair skin, and messy blond hair that is short except for a section at the back of his head that goes down to his shoulders.
A protector from afar with a loyal heart
What Taroumaru meant was that Thoma is very good at taking care of people and is a very good friend. But you can't just take care of others, you have to take care of yourself too... Wait, what are you laughing at! I was just translating what Taroumaru said!—Gorou
Thoma, who was born in Mondstadt, now lives in Inazuma, where he is the Kamisato Clan's housekeeper. He's also a well-known "fixer" in Inazuma.
Perhaps influenced by the relaxed and happy atmosphere of his hometown, Thoma is very good at socializing. Although he is an outlander, he has built an unexpectedly powerful network of people in Inazuma.
He is an affable person by nature and can easily get involved in various topics and establish relationships with various people. When it is time to defend the rights and interests of the Yashiro Commission, he will also put his smile away and show his serious side.
Occasionally, however, Thoma will sit alone in a corner of the Yashiro Commission and think about matters concerning himself.
He is an attentive, friendly, and sociable person who cares for all animals and comrades, but perhaps he also feels some unspeakable homesickness.
The Kamisato Clan's housekeeper. A well-known "fixer" in Inazuma.
Thoma's official title in the Kamisato Clan is that of a "housekeeper," and he is responsible for matters such as cooking and cleaning.
Thoma has always employed methods of his own to develop the influence of the Yashiro Commission in certain unknown quarters.
Thoma's official title in the Kamisato Clan is that of a "housekeeper," and as such, he is responsible for matters such as cleaning and cooking.Whenever he appears at the Yashiro Commission, Thoma is almost always busy with such work. He is able to get everything done well, and even Furuta, the butler of the Kamisato Clan, is full of praise for his housekeeping skills.However, most of the time, Thoma does not stay in the Yashiro Commission, but goes elsewhere to deal with some special matters discreetly.For example: solving the problems encountered by the Yashiro Commission, asking for information for the head of the Kamisato Clan, fulfilling Ayaka's wishes, etc.In those unknown corners, Thoma has always used his own way to develop the influence of the Yashiro Commission.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Thoma seems to have been born with a good temper.Regardless of whether he's dealing with a dignitary or a street vendor, Thoma can easily find an opening to join the conversation and have a good time with them.Thoma, who is good at socializing, has a wide range of contacts in Inazuma. When he first arrived in Inazuma, he relied on his insight and communication skills to make friends with people in various industries. Later, many people would take the initiative to get to know Thoma.The more people you know, the more resources you can get. Thoma would learn a lot of first-hand information from them, or quietly strike "deals" that are beneficial to the Yashiro Commission.However, although Thoma has a vast network of contacts, he has never used it for personal gain, nor has he ever forced others to do things in the name of the Yashiro Commission.Sociability, precise judgment, and just the right amount of tact. Perhaps this is the reason why Thoma can thrive as a "fixer" in Inazuma.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
Surprisingly, the handsome and cheerful Thoma has no resistance when it comes to cute animals.When Thoma's out, he always carries some small snacks for animals, and feeds stray cats and dogs when he sees them.It never fails to make him smile seeing animals scarf food down.To Thoma, these animals, like himself, are part of what makes up the world.Even if they don't seem to be eye-catching, they are still trying to live.As long as you live, good things will always happen... This is what Thoma has always believed in.Even if these animals had not encountered good things before, he hoped that at least his presence would be a good thing worth celebrating for.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
As the housekeeper of the Kamisato Clan, Thoma is an "all-rounder" when it comes to housekeeping.Whether it's cleaning, cooking, sewing, gardening, caregiving, or socializing, he can handle it all with ease.For Thoma, housekeeping is not only a job and duty, but also his hobby.He would clean the house like new, making sure that there was not a single grain of dust left on the railings. He would be in a very happy mood when faced with a clean and tidy Yashiro Commission.Perhaps it's the sense of accomplishment that comes with cleaning. Whenever he has the chance, Thoma will pick up a broom or duster and sweep away any unsightly stains.In addition, he also takes special care of the daily lives of his colleagues around him.There was a winter when Inazuma's temperature suddenly dipped, and a guard of the Yashiro Commission accidentally caught a cold while out on patrol. A few days later, he unexpectedly received a sweater hand-knitted by Thoma.The sweater that was just the right size made the guard think back to the clothes he received from his mother every winter. Now that his mother was old, she hadn't sent him clothes for many years.With this in mind, the guard took a long leave of absence to visit his family. The day he came back, he brought Thoma a special souvenir from his hometown, and they became good friends.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Thoma's father is an Inazuman and his mother is a Mondstadter.Thoma grew up in Mondstadt and has been accustomed to its carefree and happy atmosphere since he was young. Influenced by this, he can easily mingle with anyone.However, he has also been taught by his father since he was a child and places great importance on the word "loyalty".After Thoma's father returned to Inazuma, he was worried that his old man would not be able to drink Mondstadt's wine there, so he sailed to Inazuma alone in a boat carrying Dandelion Wine.On the way, a huge wave overturned the boat and Thoma fell into the water. Fortunately, he just drifted unconscious down the water until he got washed ashore on a beach in Inazuma.At that time, Thoma had nothing and no family with him, but still started his life in Inazuma with optimism.However, despite his best efforts, he was unable to find his father, who was supposed to be in Inazuma.But at his most difficult moment, Thoma met someone in Inazuma who was worthy of his "loyalty" to the end.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Due to his hailing from Mondstadt, Thoma is often regarded as an "outsider" by the local residents of Inazuma.Despite the strange looks and gossip directed towards him, Thoma never showed any dissatisfaction, and always smiled at all doubts.Thoma is recognized as the most amiable person in the Yashiro Commission, but to outsiders, it is another story."Don't offend Thoma! Otherwise, things will be difficult to handle."No one is sure when it started, but this saying has gone around so much that many people are convinced of this when they hear it.As for those who have had unpleasant run-ins with Thoma, the mention of him still instills fear:"Don't be fooled by that guy! He's always smiling kindly, but all I did was cheat the Yashiro Commission of a small sum of money, and he..."That's right, if anyone dares to harm the interests of the Yashiro Commission or disrespect the Kamisato siblings, Thoma will make them pay.He sees this as his duty and does his best, but does not like to boast about his achievements. Even if he is criticized for this, he will not defend himself too much."Gee, who cares about such trivialities? And it doesn't matter what kind of person I am, as long as those who should know know it."Old Duster Friendship Lv. 4
Thoma's favorite duster has been with him in many "conquests".As it has been used for too long, no matter how Thoma cleans and takes care of it now, it still looks old and gray. Despite this, Thoma is still reluctant to discard it.This duster was given to Thoma when he was first assigned cleaning duties at Yashiro Commission. As soon as he sees it, he recalls those hard but happy times.At that time, Thoma had yet to comprehend various cleaning techniques. Due to his lack of experience, he was often busy doing all kinds of cleaning and tidying work until late at night.Accompanying him were the moonlight above his head, the chirping of insects in the summer night, and the sound of a duster tapping on the beams.There are many different kinds of cleaning. From a simple cleaning to an all-out deep cleaning, Thoma has experienced it all.At first, he found the work boring, but after he got used to it, he found that he could think more quietly when cleaning.So to this day, Thoma often uses this duster to perform his work.While brushing away the dust in front of him, he also brushed away the fog in his head in a quiet and steady state of mind.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
In his early years living in Mondstadt, Thoma did not have particularly strong aspirations.Each day, he was awakened by the early morning sun and the fresh fragrance of flowers. After breakfast, he could choose to take a relaxing stroll through the city or explore the wilderness freely.At that time, Thoma thought that people should have the happiness of living a leisurely life. Perhaps it would have been better to live a peaceful life.This calm mood disappeared the moment when he was swept into a strange country by the waves, across the ocean in a small boat.Here, he had to receive a favor to survive, and thus the thought of "repayment" arose.Ten years ago, when the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan was losing its power.Kamisato Ayato, who was embroiled in the dispute over the succession rights of the clan due to the death of both parents, told Thoma:"Now that the situation in Inazuma is unclear, the trouble the Kamisato Clan faces will only increase. You are someone who can see what's at stake, so if you don't want to get involved, leave early."Could Thoma, who had received so many favors from the Kamisato Clan, just leave like that? Choosing to leave would mean that he would have to return to his ordinary, stable life with regrets and guilt.The storm was imminent, and Thoma was like a leaf drifting in the sea.But after much deliberation, Thoma's answer was:"If I leave at this time, I will lose my loyalty and righteousness. Father has always taught me to be a loyal and righteous man... I would like to do my best to do my part for the young master and the young lady. You will certainly need me as a helper in the path you embark on in the future."The will to burn for loyalty and righteousness forged a strong desire that drew the attention of the gods.As if to respond to Thoma's choice — on this night of divergent destinies, a Vision, bright red like a blaze, appeared beside him.

Thoma wields the ascended version of the Kitain Cross Spear in his official art.
Thoma is the first new male 4* character since the release of the game.
Thoma is mentioned in the description of the following Furnishing: Sakura-Hued Street
Thoma is a variation of the Ancient Greek name Thomas (Greek: Θωμᾶς Thōmâs), which in turn is derived from the Aramaic name תאומא meaning "twin". It also resembles the Japanese name "Tōma", which alludes to Thoma's Inazuman ancestry. This may also be based on the practice of foreigners adopting Japanese legal names upon naturalization; which was especially true for foreign-born samurai who adopted new names in Japan that resembled those of the natives living there.
His constellation name, Rubeum Scutum, is Latin for "red shield".

Something to ShareSomething to ShareMedia:VO_Thoma Something to Share.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Thoma_Something_to_Share.ogg I've gotten to know all kinds of people over the years, and I'd say that Inazumans are more particular about etiquette than Mondstadters. If you make sure you're always polite to people, it's much easier to get things done.
Interesting Things: TanukiInteresting Things: TanukiMedia:VO_Thoma Interesting Things - Tanuki.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Thoma_Interesting_Things_-_Tanuki.ogg I've always wanted to see a tanuki shapeshifting. They say it can change into all kinds of things, and that it likes to play pranks on passersby. It's a creature with a sense of humor, that's for sure.
Interesting Things: AnimalsInteresting Things: AnimalsMedia:VO_Thoma Interesting Things - Animals.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Thoma_Interesting_Things_-_Animals.ogg Are you an animal person, too? If you are, let me take you to the outskirts some time, it's great. I just need to give a whistle, and all these puppies and kittens will come out of nowhere and start strutting around your ankles, clamoring for your affection. Haha, just imagining it is already brightening my day.
About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Thoma About Yae Miko.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Thoma_About_Yae_Miko.ogg Lady Miko? Wh—What about her? *sigh* Every time Miss Kamisato sends me out to deliver messages, my least-favorite destination is the Grand Narukami Shrine... Oh! N—Not because Lady Miko scares the bejeebers out of me, it's, uh... respect. Yes! She strikes respect deep into my heart, ahahahaha...
About the Raiden Shogun: Comparison Friendship Lv. 4About the Raiden Shogun: Comparison Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Thoma About the Raiden Shogun - Comparison.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Thoma_About_the_Raiden_Shogun_-_Comparison.ogg In my homeland of Mondstadt, almost everyone has great reverence for the Anemo Archon, Barbatos. But people in Inazuma feel a little differently toward the Shogun. How can I put this... They feel love, respect, gratitude... but also fear.
About the Raiden Shogun: The Unknown Friendship Lv. 4 Stillness, the Sublimation of ShadowAbout the Raiden Shogun: The Unknown Friendship Lv. 4 Stillness, the Sublimation of ShadowMedia:VO_Thoma About the Raiden Shogun - The Unknown.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Thoma_About_the_Raiden_Shogun_-_The_Unknown.ogg Honestly, I don't harbor any resentment toward the Shogun. Yes, she almost took my Vision away, but ultimately that's just because of her unique perspective. Everyone has their own perspective, there's nothing strange about that.The only thing I don't understand is her goal in doing so. What does she imagine eternity really looks like for Inazuma? And why is sacrificing her people's aspirations so necessary to achieve it? I can neither understand nor agree with her approach.

She once promised to take me out onto the open ocean to get a look at the thunderstorm that seals off Inazuma from the outside world. It's a shame that to this day, I've never had the chance to take her up on the offer...
About Kamisato Ayato Friendship Lv. 4About Kamisato Ayato Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Thoma About Kamisato Ayato.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Thoma_About_Kamisato_Ayato.ogg As head of the Kamisato Clan, he's in a tough position. With all the political upheaval, he has to contend with public disquiet on one hand and a bunch of self-serving, degenerate public officials on the other. It's best not to dwell on it. All I can do is make sure to look out for him when he's at home.

The one thing she could do better is to speak her mind more. In fact, watch out for this the next time you're talking to her — sometimes, she looks like she's about to say something, but then she holds back. If that happens, keep asking her opinion, see if you can encourage her to open up a little.

She's so easy to get along with. Super straightforward, just says whatever she thinks. Oh, and Naganohara fireworks are just incredible, you should take every chance you get to see them in action. Ah, on that note — here, have a coupon!
About Sayu Friendship Lv. 4About Sayu Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Thoma About Sayu.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Thoma_About_Sayu.ogg Ah Sayu, stubborn Sayu. I've asked her countless times to teach me ninjutsu, but she always refuses. She even goes out of her way to avoid me now... I'm just a student looking for a teacher, am I really that out of line?
About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Thoma About Kujou Sara.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Thoma_About_Kujou_Sara.ogg The Tenryou Commission General... Mm... Make sure to be extra careful if you have any dealings with her. She has a lot of power in her hands, and she's not very open to persuasion. Smiling and batting your eyelids certainly won't get you anywhere with her.

Word on the street is that he's quite a character — apparently, he even has youkai heritage. Have you met him? If you two are close, maybe you could introduce me sometime. It's good to make friends from all walks of life... youkai included!

He seems to have his own way of doing things — not the easiest person to get along with. Also... Any situation that involves a detective is probably not one that's going to end well. I think I'll keep on giving him a wide berth.
About Jean Friendship Lv. 4About Jean Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Thoma About Jean.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Thoma_About_Jean.ogg Oh, so Jean from the Gunnhildr Clan is the Master of the Knights of Favonius now? She definitely deserves it, she's known all over for her impeccable conduct... Oh, just the "Acting" Grand Master? Haha, well, someone of her standing won't care about titles.

All I know is that their whole family are about the worst-tempered people you could ever meet. You're better off steering clear of them if you can help it. Ah, now I'm in a Mondstadt mood again... The memories.

I took a boat all the way here from Mondstadt, found I liked the place, and was also lucky enough to meet the wonderful Kamisato siblings, so I just ended up staying.

I try to look out for them as much as I can. The difference between us is that they see themselves as just passing by, and have no intention of trying to integrate here. And because that's how they think, it becomes their reality. The majority of Inazumans will never see them as anything more than outsiders.
More About Thoma: IV Friendship Lv. 5More About Thoma: IV Friendship Lv. 5Media:VO_Thoma More About Thoma - 04.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Thoma_More_About_Thoma_-_04.ogg For some of the more conservatively minded people in Inazuma, the idea of an outlander working as a retainer for one of the Commissions is unthinkable. So there was a time when I was not that welcome here. I'm pretty sure I'd have been deported a long time ago without a couple of Kamisatos fighting my corner. I couldn't let the clan down after they'd been so kind to me, so I put in a lot of honest work, and eventually, everyone was finally able to accept me.

Ah, hopefully you won't mind. I went through a period where I really just wanted to go home — Mondstadt is my homeland, after all. But I was torn... It wouldn't be easy to leave Inazuma behind, either. I mean, just look how good the people here have been to me. The Kamisato Clan always has a room for me, and there are people I've met here that are like family. So, I went back and forth over it, and ultimately decided I'd stay in Inazuma. When I'm missing Mondstadt... I can just chat with you. You don't mind my rambling, do you?
Thoma's HobbiesThoma's HobbiesMedia:VO_Thoma Hobbies.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Thoma_Hobbies.ogg I've been really getting into stories about the unnatural recently. Especially ones about shapeshifting youkai — they're so fascinating. Before that, I was really into ninjutsu for a while, and before that... Hmm? You think I'm not dedicated enough? N—No! It's not like that, you got me all wrong!

If we're counting beverages, though... I'm not very good with alcohol. Don't laugh, and before you say it — yes, I've wondered what this says about my identity as a Mondstadter. But, y'know... too much alcohol is bad for you, anyway. So not drinking is a good thing.

Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Thoma: That would spell the end for me... I, uh, couldn't help but pat it on the head when I came in...
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Thoma: Sure! The atmosphere here's really relaxed. It's perfect for chatting the day away.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Thoma: By the way, I've been hoping to show you around the Grand Narukami Shrine when we get the chance.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Thoma: The Sacred Sakura at the shrine is in bloom year-round. Seeing the falling blossoms dance in the wind is quite a sight to behold... definitely a surefire way to make you fall in love with Inazuma.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Thoma: Haha, great!
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Thoma: And speaking of the Grand Narukami Shrine, one word of advice... Don't ever attack any of the kitsune nearby.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Thoma: Not that you'd ever dream of doing something like that... would you?
 Of course not, I always respect the wildlife.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship2 07a.ogg Thoma: Ah, that's good. I always knew that you were a kindhearted person.
 Why, what's the worst that could happen?
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship2 07b.ogg Thoma: Huh, you're not seriously considering it, are you? Trust me, don't let curiosity get the best of you. Attacking a kitsune is bad luck.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Thoma: I know an old lady who loves telling stories about the unnatural. She told me that someone was once sentenced to "judgment by lightning" after attacking one of the kitsune near the shrine.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Thoma: Kitsune are highly favored by the Grand Narukami, so I guess the offender only got what was coming to them.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Thoma: Regardless, you should probably try not to provoke any animals you encounter, regardless of the species.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship2 11.ogg Thoma: All plants and creatures equally deserve our respect.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Thoma: Actually, I was hoping to find a nice, open area and invite you to do some skygazing together.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Thoma: Something about the sky here seems clearer than anywhere else. It makes me feel... peaceful inside.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Thoma: Don't get me wrong, sunset in Inazuma is impressive, too, but somehow it feels a little more... somber than what you have here.
 Well, we are inside an adeptus' teapot, after all.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship3 04a.ogg Thoma: Huh, you're right... which is already pretty astonishing. To think that the two of us along with a whole expanse of sky can be packed inside a tiny little teapot.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship3 04b.ogg Thoma: Really? You do? It's great that you know how I feel.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Thoma: Ahhhh...
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Thoma: Even if this crystal-blue sky is just a teapot's illusion, a moment of pure tranquility is a great thing all the same.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Thoma: Haha, I guess I always try to see the positive side of things.
 I appreciate that about you, Thoma.
 That's why you can live a happy life.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Thoma Haha, thanks for that.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Thoma: On a more serious note, though you may not want to show it... I can see the tiring toll of your journey in your eyes sometimes.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Thoma: Since we're already here, why not try to leave your worries behind and put your mind at ease for a while?
Media:vo thoma mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Thoma: And if you ever feel lonely, don't worry — you've always got me here to keep you company.
Media:vo thoma mimitomo morning 01.ogg Thoma: Morning, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!
Media:vo thoma mimitomo morning 02.ogg Thoma: If you'd like some breakfast, I'd be more than happy to whip something up for ya?
Media:vo thoma mimitomo night 01.ogg Thoma: Night, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! Try not to kick off all your covers, okay?
Media:vo thoma mimitomo night 02.ogg Thoma: See you tomorrow.
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.
Media:vo mimitomo dq thoma tearoom 01.ogg Thoma: Nice teahouse you've got here. I can see you put a lot of thought into the furniture and teaware.
Media:vo mimitomo dq thoma tearoom 02.ogg Thoma: Personally, I think a few pets would complete the atmosphere... What do you say?
Media:vo mimitomo dq thoma tearoom 03.ogg Thoma: Don't worry, you can leave them to me to take care of.
Media:vo mimitomo dq thoma shoppingarcade 01.ogg Thoma: Great job here, you really know what you're doing! If you placed this in Inazuma, you could probably steal a good chunk of business from Hanamizaka.
Media:vo mimitomo dq thoma shoppingarcade 02.ogg Thoma: Shame I can't flex my "fixer" muscles around here. In other words... no discounts for Thoma.
Media:vo mimitomo dq thoma shoppingarcade 03.ogg Thoma: I won't let that affect our outings here though. Food and drink's on me, hehe.
