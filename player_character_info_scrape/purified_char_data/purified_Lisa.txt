An outfit Lisa had someone commission for her when she revisited Sumeru. A perfect balance between practicality and elegance, the dress bears a resemblance to Lisa's old uniform from the Akademiya days.

Lisa's hair is tied in two loose braids that rest on her shoulders in front and are tied at the ends with purple rose accessories. She is wearing a dark green hat that is mostly resting on the left side of her head. The hat has a large golden decoration inlaid with a blue gem.
Lisa wears a short dark green top over a loose white shirt with poofy sleeves. She wears short white bottoms and a golden thigh accessory under a long strip of white cloth with a decoration of a Sumeru-style building at the bottom. Lisa also wears a golden collar and her Vision on a necklace.
In the eyes of ordinary people, just as flowers differ in quality due to the nature of their growth, so too do academic achievements differ in worth.
Certain researchers of exemplary capabilities are compared to "Padisarahs," while those with more common accomplishments are regarded as akin to the more widely seen "Mints."
As time passed, some students also found themselves influenced by these analogies. Thus, they began to use different species of flowers as amusing nicknames for each other.
It was unanimously agreed that the Akademiya was full of "Sweet Flowers" and "Mints," but "Roses" and "Padisarahs" were individuals of vanishing quality.
Thus, it was baffling to many that the genius Lisa Minci possessed all the qualities of a "Padisarah" but cared little even to claim the title of "Rose."
As an academic, she finished a great many projects left incomplete by those who came before her, and also possessed a solid grasp of theory.
Her accomplishments earned her the regard of her instructors, and soon she was allowed to study even the most complex of topics. In little time, she began contributing to the advancement of her new studies as well.
At that time, certain researchers even thought that she could become the youngest sage in history — provided she made a few adjustments to her field of study, of course.
Yet, she didn't participate in the official signing ceremony that would certify her academic accomplishments, choosing instead to withdraw from the main project she was studying in her Darshan, before leaving the Akademiya altogether.
When faced with the confusion radiating from her classmates' questions, she merely replied as elegantly and affably as she always did:
"My work can be compared to rearranging a mess of books and putting them all back in their rightful place, that's all. With that in mind, it's unnecessary for me to claim something so serious as an official title."
"Also, do you remember that song that was so popular amongst us students?"
"'We beg not for the Kalpalata Lotus' mystery, we struggle not to claim the Padisarah's purity.'"
"'For with poetry by our sides, their fragrance ever lingers in our lives.'"
"In times past, the rose was a flower precious without peer. But after generations of scholars worked tirelessly to cultivate them, roses can now be found wherever the sunlight shines."
"But is this bad for the roses? Well, of course not. Rare or common, the roses remain as fragrant as ever. Their preciousness was but a label we gave them."
"As such, if there comes a day when everyone ceases to regard these flowers so subjectively and instead judges them with consideration to their growth habits and choice of environments... That day's coming, I think, might be something worthier of commemoration."
These are heard when equipping the costume.

OverviewLoreVoice-OversOutfitsCompanionGallery
She is an intellectual witch who can never get enough naps. As the Librarian of the Knights of Favonius, Lisa is smart in that she always knows exactly what to do with whatever troubles her.As much as she loves her sleep, she still manages to keep everything under control in a calm, composed manner.—Description from the Official Website[1]
The languid but knowledgeable Librarian of the Knights of Favonius, deemed by Sumeru Akademiya to be their most distinguished graduate in the past two centuries.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Lisa is a proficient witch; as such, she enjoys everything related to the elements and items that would help her understand them. Despite her position as Librarian, Lisa takes it somewhat haphazardly as she appears to be relatively bored dealing with normal books, instead preferring those in the restricted section. She still takes the job seriously nonetheless, and will personally go out to collect books that are long overdue, albeit in a way that she can still enjoy the smaller things in life.
Her haphazard, carefree personality comes from her time in Sumeru Akademiya, as while studying there she noticed the types of effects the pursuit of knowledge can have on a person. She studied in the Spantamad school for two years and left Sumeru shortly after graduating,[2] relegating herself to categorization and management of the library and usually refusing to take any other duties unless absolutely necessary. Despite repeated pleas from Gafoor to return to the Akademiya, Lisa refuses to give up her life in Mondstadt. 
When Lisa is angered, the surrounding air near her becomes electrified in part due to her Electro Vision. Depending on the severity of what has angered her, she can either be simply irritated or become extremely scary, the latter also causing her to dispense "appropriate" punishment.
Lisa seems to be fond of the Traveler, and sometimes acts flirtatious, referring to them as "cutie" or "darling," and admitting that they're special to her.[3]
She loves tea and thinks that afternoon tea is the most important part of her day. She sometimes takes tea with vegetable soup as she once used to enjoy this with Jean at the Good Hunter restaurant. She also suffers from cucurbitophobia, a fear of pumpkins.

Lisa uses the tall female model. She has fair skin, green eyes, and wavy, shoulder-length light honey-brown hair.
"There'll be time for this later... Come sit and chat with me."
If you put enough flour into Hydro Slimes, would they turn into Dough Slimes?—The first question Lisa asked the Sage on her first day in Sumeru Academia.[4]
"There'll be time for this later... Come sit and chat with me."
Lisa, Librarian of the Knights of Favonius, has great wisdom that is unparalleled throughout the city. She always knows what to do with whatever troubles Mondstadt.
But with so many careless readers and overdue books to deal with, Lisa often gets tired and a bit... drowsy. Never disturb her when she's taking her morning, midday, or evening naps. Otherwise you will come to understand why she is an outstanding knight — in an electrifying way...
The librarian of the Knights of Favonius. In addition to her elegance and charm, Lisa is also highly educated.She is said to have been the most talented sorceress to study at the Sumeru Akademiya in the last two centuries.It is known that Lisa chose to return to Mondstadt after two years of advanced study in Sumeru, but the reason for her decision is not. At present, Lisa's job is to oversee the book collection in the library owned by the Knights.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Lisa is tasked with managing and maintaining the vast collection of books in the Knights of Favonius library, as well as ensuring that their potions are always fully stocked.The only time that the citizens of Mondstadt see Lisa is when lending or returning library books.In both scenarios, they tend to encounter Lisa sitting at the counter like a languid cat, yawning as she signs books in and out.At times, her behavior causes people to doubt whether she is really up to the task of being librarian for the illustrious Knights of Favonius.Nevertheless, it appears that she performs every task flawlessly, as her work consistently stands up to scrutiny.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
The fact that Cyrus of the Sumeru Akademiya frequently refers to Lisa as their "best student in two hundred years" is all that needs to be said about Lisa's accomplishments in her studies.From outlandish forbidden knowledge, to the handling of elementally infused flora, to the most efficient methods of distilling wine... where there is a body of knowledge, the chances are that Lisa is acquainted with it.This, paired with her ability to explain things clearly and concisely, makes Lisa the sensible person to approach for young knights and alchemists with burning questions.That is, provided they go and see her at an acceptable hour.To visit during unacceptable hours — such as in the morning while Lisa is sleeping in, or in the afternoon while she's enjoying her tea — can spell disaster for unsuspecting visitors.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
When people meet Lisa for the first time, they often find themselves overawed by the famous alumna of the Sumeru Akademiya.However, though her attitude to life may appear at first to be one of ruthless efficiency, it is in fact better understood as a product of her incorrigibly lazy nature, which drives her to avoid troublesome issues at all costs.By negotiating with Kaeya, she offloaded the job of restocking and dispensing medication to Huffman and Swan, and had Flora start sending Donna over to deliver herbs on a daily basis.The only tasks that Lisa handles personally are the categorization and management of books and other documents.This is the one area where Lisa feels more comfortable handling the work herself rather than delegating it.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
When Lisa first joined the Knights of Favonius, the Grand Master sought to appoint her as Captain of the 8th Company.This was much to the consternation of the company's Field Officer, Nymph, who resented the idea of an academic coming in at such a high-ranking position.At Kaeya's suggestion, a practice combat session was arranged in which Lisa and Nymph would both display their magical proficiency.Two minutes into the session, Lisa graciously declined the captaincy on the grounds that "Nymph manifestly possesses the requisite ability to fulfill the role."For the whole year following, the Grand Master received a constant stream of referral letters from Nymph in relation to the captaincy, and the only person ever named in them was Lisa Minci.Eventually, the Grand Master began turning over the referral letters to Lisa directly, but every time, Lisa would come up with an excuse to decline the offer.Undoubtedly, the 8th Company would have been far stronger under her lead, but she deemed that such a level of power was not only superfluous to requirements, it would also be risky for her in a way that most people could never appreciate.To be clear, Lisa is quite confident that she could handle any situation she came up against. However, additional danger means an additional workload — and that is something that she would never be able to accept.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Having personally witnessed raving-mad scholars in the forests of Sumeru and powerful sages sitting underutilized on advisory councils, Lisa realized what uninhibited erudition can really do to a person.It seemed such a high price to pay... How much did one have to sacrifice to attain the profoundest knowledge of all?Put off by this realization, Lisa decided to leave Sumeru.Since then, Lisa has always stopped short of taking things too seriously."Before demanding too many miracles from the gods, first consider if you are willing to pay the price they ask."These words she has spoken to just three people since arriving in Mondstadt. In each case, it was because she knew it was what they needed to hear.Special Heating Cauldron Friendship Lv. 4
The Special Heating Cauldron is a purpose-built cauldron made to a design that no one in Mondstadt could understand. It features time-delay heating, semi-automated ingredient insertion, and temperature regulation functions.Lisa spent an enormous budget and commandeered the alchemy workshop for two full weeks in order to build this extraordinary piece of equipment.She boasts that the cauldron is capable of completing any precision heating task to perfection with a maximum of just two pulls of a lever.But her most common application for it is to brew tea and keep it at the optimal temperature while she is managing her books.After all, a relaxing afternoon tea session is by far the most important part of Lisa's day.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
A Vision is a sign from the gods: a sign that you are one of those whom they have chosen to change the world.Or, maybe it's just one of the many hoops that one has to jump through on the path to unearthing the secrets of magecraft.After all, understanding the elements is essential to the study of magic, and practical experience is a far more useful means of acquiring this understanding than trying to assimilate the knowledge contained in dusty old books."Hmm... I suppose I shall need a Vision, then."And just like that, as that thought popped into her mind, her Vision popped into her hand.With the aid of her Vision, Lisa acquired the knowledge that she sought. But she also sensed the deep secret hidden in the shadows of that knowledge.For whatever reason, the gods gave humans the key to changing everything, but they did not explain the cost involved. Lisa grew fearful of the truth.The Vision that hung from her neck became to her a bottomless pit filled with sweet delights, lingering at the back of her mind.So, from time to time, when somebody whom she finds interesting comes along, Lisa will pass onto them her understanding on all kinds of matters.Perhaps she is secretly hoping that by doing so, one day someone will come along who has the ability to understand the ultimate truth behind Visions.

Lisa is a supporting character in the manga, which takes place roughly a year or less before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt.
She assisted the investigation into the Black Fire Incident by compiling reports for the Knights of Favonius to read through. She also contacted her teacher to request assistance in deciphering the ancient language found on one of the Fatui's files. Due to her request, Cyno traveled to Mondstadt and was able to seal the archon residue[Note 1] inside Collei. Lisa also assisted Collei in writing a letter to Amber in which Collei thanked Amber and said she left for Sumeru with Cyno.

↑ Due to localization adjustments made after the manga's release, the term "archon residue" is no longer accurate. The original Chinese term refers to gods that predate the rise of The Seven.
Lisa likes using "cutie" as a term of endearment while referring to the Traveler.
She taught Razor how to utilize Electro,[5] as well as how to make Mondstadt Hash Browns and speak human language.[6] In her Chinese "About Razor" line, she calls him 小狼狼 Xiǎo-lángláng, which is akin to calling him "Little Wolfie."
Lisa and Fischl share the same Korean voice actress, Park Go-woon.
Lisa is known by these titles or aliases:
The "Purple Rose" found in her character title and outfit is based on the Sumeru Rose.[2]
Lisa is mentioned in the descriptions of the following 3 Furnishings: "Archivist's Treasure Trove" "Night of the Party Pumpkins" Special Jumpy Dumpty Dodoco

Media:vo lisa mimitomo hello 01.ogg Lisa: Oh, when did you arrive, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
Media:vo lisa mimitomo hello 02.ogg Lisa: I was completely lost in thought.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Lisa: Aw, you're concerned for my well-being. Well, aren't you just the sweetest?
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Lisa: You really know how to make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Lisa: Don't you worry, I love it here.
 Is there any part you would want to renovate?
 Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the place?
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Lisa: Not at all.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Lisa: I think what makes this place so special is the fact that it was built personally by you.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Lisa: If I were to start nitpicking, it would only ruin your creativity and the unique charm you bring to the place.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship1 07.ogg Lisa: I certainly wouldn't want that to happen.
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Lisa: When would I ever not?
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Lisa: If it weren't for my library work and potion-making duties, I'd love nothing more than to spend every day chatting with you like this.
 Have there been many people borrowing books recently?
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship2 03a 1.ogg Lisa: The number of people borrowing books is around the same as always. But lately, more people seem to be returning them on time than ever before.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship2 03a 2.ogg Lisa: It seems that the citizens of the "City of Freedom" have become more conscious of time. Frankly, I'm quite relieved.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship2 03a 3.ogg Lisa: Of course, I can't expect everyone to be as sensible as you, cutie.
 Lisa, you're making me blush again...
 Made any special potions recently?
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship2 03b 1.ogg Lisa: Special potions? Hmm...
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship2 03b 2.ogg Lisa: Oh! As a matter of fact, I concocted one that makes textiles softer to the touch.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship2 03b 3.ogg Lisa: And another that keeps the air fragrant and fresh. I'm quite fond of that one.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship2 03b 4.ogg Lisa: They weren't requested by the Knights of Favonius, though. I just made them out of personal interest.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship2 03b 5.ogg Lisa: Hmm... Is it just me, or have my interests become more domestic in nature since I met you...?
 Lisa, you're making me blush again...
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Lisa: Haha...
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Lisa: You look so adorable with a little more red in your cheeks, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
 Is there anything you'd like to do?
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Lisa: I'd quite like to invite you to afternoon tea.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Lisa: I can offer you Sunsettia or Rose Bud Tea... And as for snacks, what kind of cake do you like?
 Are you going to bake it yourself?
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship3 03a.ogg Lisa: Haha, you guessed correctly.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship3 03b 1.ogg Lisa: Ah, you're so easygoing. It's so relaxing spending time with you.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship3 03b 2.ogg Lisa: But for once, I do want to take the trouble to make something nice.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Lisa: There is nothing I can't create if I put my mind to it.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Lisa: It's just that...
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Lisa: Most of the time, I don't find these sort of things to be worth all the extra effort.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Lisa: But you are special to me. I don't think about energy spent if it's for you.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Lisa: Hmm, perhaps instead of asking for your preferences...
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Lisa: ...I should let it be a surprise instead.
 Your kind offer alone was the most delightful surprise I could hope for.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Lisa: Oh my! Remind me not to add too much sugar, because you, cutie, are sweet enough already.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Lisa: Seriously, though, I need to start getting prepared...
Media:vo lisa mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Lisa: We can't have you underestimating me.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo morning 01.ogg Lisa: Morning, cutie.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo morning 02.ogg Lisa: I'm sure you're keeping on top of everything that needs doing.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo morning 03.ogg Lisa: But if you find yourself struggling at any point, you know I'm always available to lend a hand.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo night 01.ogg Lisa: Have a good night, cutie.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo night 02.ogg Lisa: *yawn* I'm so sleepy. I'm a little envious of the way you manage to stay so energetic even at this hour.
Media:vo lisa mimitomo night 03.ogg Lisa: Be sure to get enough sleep...
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.
Media:vo mimitomo md lisa study 01.ogg Lisa: You have good taste in literature.
Media:vo mimitomo md lisa study 02.ogg Lisa: Large bookshelves and a fireplace... This would be a most comfy place to put my feet up.
Media:vo mimitomo md lisa study 03.ogg Lisa: I must reward you well for making this place so cozy.
Media:vo mimitomo md lisa alchemy 01.ogg Lisa: Oh? A place suited for quiet research, I see.
Media:vo mimitomo md lisa alchemy 02.ogg Lisa: Not only are reference materials readily available, but you can initiate experiments at any time as well. This is truly a mage's ideal workshop.
Media:vo mimitomo md lisa alchemy 03.ogg Lisa: You really are a cutie after my own heart.
