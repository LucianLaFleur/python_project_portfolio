A talented pyrotechnician. The current owner of Naganohara Fireworks known as the "Queen of the Summer Festival."
A girl filled with fiery passion. The uncompromising childish innocence and the obsession with craftsmanship intertwine in her to create a spectacular blaze.—Description from the Official Website[1]
Owner of Naganohara Fireworks. Known as "Queen of the Summer Festival," she excels in her craft of creating fireworks that symbolize people's hopes and dreams.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Yoimiya, like the rest of her family, is loved by the people of Inazuma City for the fireworks she creates. She is also loved by children due to her friendly hands-on approach with them, as she wishes to keep them happy so they don't have to deal with the harsh realities of Inazuma for the time being. Having very few worries of her own, she can also read peoples' hearts and can tell whether or not they're hiding something deep down.
Like her father, Yoimiya is devoted to the family business, stating that her customers' happiness is the first priority above all else. This service has amassed a massive and loyal customer base who are willing to help her out on any problems she has. She is somewhat of a fast speaker, and despite being the primary provider of fireworks, is also known to be quite reckless and unprepared, having been scolded by the city's fire brigade numerous times and noted by Amenoma Tougo to always make last-minute preparations.
Like many other Vision bearers, Yoimiya enjoys her Pyro Vision, as it helps her out with the business. While not supportive of the Vision Hunt Decree, she still worships Ei.
Yoimiya uses the medium female model. She has a fair complexion, golden eyes with orange-red makeup painted at the corners, and shoulder-length light strawberry blonde hair. There is a small flower tattoo near her left shoulder and another similar tattoo patch around her upper left arm containing a red fish, flowers, and purple swirls.
Time to start the celebration, and let the fireworks bloom in the sky!
Fireworks are the highlight of the festival, and Yoimiya is Inazuma's best pyrotechnician. Every display she planned turns out fabulously. Ah, right, do not worry about the fire hazards. The Yashiro Commission and shrine maidens will take care of the necessary precautions so that she can fully express her creativity.—Kamisato Ayaka
A talented pyrotechnician. The current owner of Naganohara Fireworks known as the "Queen of the Summer Festival." She is a household name in Inazuma.
Various celebrations held in Inazuma City every year all have elaborate firework displays created by Yoimiya. She possesses an exuberant creativity and passion for firework displays that always leave people pleasantly surprised.
Yoimiya has a childlike innocence, and is often found playing simple yet timeless games with children or accompanying them to find shiny trinkets and toys. The purity of children brings her unparalleled joy.
She also enjoys social interaction and seizes every opportunity to talk to others. She appears to have endless anecdotes and ideas to be shared.
Principle and craftsmanship are Yoimiya's dearest qualities. Even though fireworks are fleeting, their blaze and warmth lives in people's hearts forever.
Both a moment and an eternity, these fleeting marvels are an expression of "protection" she gives to those around her.
It is because of everyone's involvement that the firework shows can carry on in such a beautiful manner.
Yoimiya's name is renowned throughout Hanamizaka.She is the most skilled pyrotechnician in Inazuma and is known as the "Queen of the Summer Festival."Yoimiya, who has inherited the mantle of "Naganohara", is able to give people an unparalleled experience with her ever-changing and spectacular fireworks.In addition to being a craftsperson, she is also the "heroic sister" in the eyes of many children. No matter how big the problem is, Yoimiya always has a solution to save the day.Be it the illusions of fear or the shadows of cold reality, they will all dissipate under the starlight magic of Yoimiya's fireworks.The children are not the only ones she helps — as long as one is willing to talk to her about their troubles, she will lend a helping hand, and try her best to help them through the crisis.Splendid fireworks, warm starlight and passionate lights all join in a swirling dance in Yoimiya's hands. Her bright smile is always able to inspire fellow travelers and light up the way for them.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
To Inazumans, fireworks symbolize summer.The various festivals that take place at fixed times feature a rotation of various events, with fireworks being the sole constant.Over a century ago, the Yashiro Commission once organized a dazzling fireworks display with "commemoration" as the theme.The fireworks then were made by the greatest pyrotechnicians in the land, and this was the origin of the Naganohara Fireworks Show.In latter days, fireworks would become more common, and the Naganohara Fireworks Show would slowly become an event in which all people would participate.During the Fireworks Show, everyone can light their favorite fireworks, and the owner of the Naganohara Fireworks store will pick an appropriate time to set up a most lavish performance.The year Yoimiya took over, her first fiesta was already jaw-droppingly good.On the night before that Fireworks Show, Kamisato Ayaka enjoined Yoimiya thusly: "Her Excellency will be watching this fireworks display personally. As such, please add Her Excellency's emblem — the Electro Mitsudomoe — into the fireworks repertoire, if you would.""Haha, just wait for it!" Yoimiya replied, agreeing with great confidence.Before the show could begin, Yoimiya ran all about the city, placing thousands of launch tubes in every nook and cranny. At the festival's finale, the blazing fireworks formed a gigantic picture scroll that depicted the city of Inazuma in the skies.Yet Ayaka did not find the critical emblem in any one of these fireworks, and wondered if Yoimiya had made an error in her arrangements.It was only after speaking with Yoimiya that Ayaka discovered that the image of Inazuma in the skies had an "angling" trick added to it.If viewed from the Tenshukaku, the fireworks would form a huge, clear, and orderly image of the Raiden Shogun's house-crest — with some playfully lacy decorations on the side to boot.Of course, how could Yoimiya miss a beat at a fireworks performance? This way, she won the praise of both the people and the Raiden Shogun, and this feast would become a timeless classic deeply rooted in the memories of countless people.With Yoimiya around, the Inazuman summer shall not lack any glorious fireworks — thus was her nickname, "Queen of the Summer Festival," coined.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
Naganohara's fireworks are loved by all, and work in the shop is always in full swing. As such, people often feel that coming up to the door without important matters might hinder the work.However, it's just the opposite with Yoimiya, for chatting is her other great hobby. In fact, if there's no one to talk to, she might actually find it hard to focus.If chatting with the guest is her way of "understanding their mood and way of thinking, such that the best fireworks can be crafted," then going with the flow and sitting down for tea and an idle chat with them after delivering the goods is how Yoimiya rewards herself. Sometimes, if that is not enough, she will make some small-talk with her neighbors on the way, give them some small trinkets, and receive a basket of small treats in return...Yoimiya is always able to strike a balance between listening and speaking in such chats.She doesn't repeat herself, doesn't cross boundaries, doesn't come off as indifferent or overly invested. After a talk over tea, everyone leaves in a good mood.Her neighbors are all ordinary folk, and their lives are not exactly full of extraordinary things. Sometimes, the same news will be told by different people over and over, but Yoimiya does not find this upsetting.What she enjoys is the process of talking to others — even if they speak of the same matter, different people will have different viewpoints.After taking over the fireworks shop, Yoimiya's relationships with her neighbors became still more harmonious. Many old folks have taken her for an old acquaintance, and often invite her to their place to sit and recount the festivals of yesteryear. Middle-aged parents will ask Yoimiya to mediate the relationship between themselves and their children and will regale her with the little trivialities of daily family life. The young people treat Yoimiya as a sibling of sorts, volunteering to help her cart heavy fireworks-making materials around, hoping that Yoimiya will get off work faster and take the children out to play.Yoimiya puts it this way: "I believe in the unique power of language. There's nothing that can't be talked through somehow!"Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Craftsmen seeking perfection are often rigorous and self-disciplined, but Yoimiya is an exception, acting freely and taking unscheduled breaks.Sometimes, she even has to work late into the night when she misses her daytime work due to chatting for too long. But when the sun begins to rise, she will climb up to the heights to see the sunrise with a sense of accomplishment at having finished her work in her heart. Looking out at the hazy amber-gold clouds, Yoimiya often gains new inspiration, imagining all manners of new fireworks in her mind, even as sleep draws near...Her neighbors have often found her sleeping in places like eaves, tree branches, and stopped waterwheels. Sometimes, she even falls down, before blearily watching her sweet dreams and golden stars fade away into the distance.Fortunately, she has never been seriously injured in such incidents, but she has gotten a number of scrapes and cuts, and it was on that account that she learned how to deal with wounds.At some other times, Yoimiya will sleep until midnight, settling all matters with gusto before heading out for a stroll.Perhaps it may turn out to be an impromptu adventure, or perhaps a test of courage. If a friend is interested, she might call upon them. If she wishes to be alone, she will travel in solitude.Living as she pleases gives Yoimiya a sense of freedom. As for others, they may encounter her at any time at all. She enjoys this freedom, often saying that it has made her life very interesting indeed.Of course, she will restrain herself on the eve of celebrations. Mistakes shall not be made during these all-important performances — her "official business."Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Apart from selling fireworks, Naganohara Fireworks also sells various intricate knickknacks. This can be said to be Yoimiya's second career.All manner of trinkets adorn the shelves, with some of them being exotic imports from Beidou that were modified and made into highly distinctive handicrafts, and others being practice works created during bursts of Yoimiya's explosive inspiration.From the Scatterbloom Marbles that will blossom when they knock against each other, Leaping Tops that chirp like birds as they spin, the Neon Dragonfly that changes hue as it ascends into the air, and the somewhat-failed Onikabuto Chariot... All these toys are inspired by the little games that the common people play.They are not only popular among the children, but are much-loved by adults as well. Even Arataki Itto, the head of the Arataki Gang, comes over to buy her specially-made knickknacks, which he then brings to go challenge the one he has declared his nemesis.Yoimiya's knickknacks are not just toys. With some thought, they can be very useful in one's daily life. The most classic example of this is the Katydid Coil, which is a ring that can contain a variety of flammables and spices. When ignited and hung up in the summer, it can be used to repel mosquitoes.Many people have come to ask Yoimiya for help on account of her excellent craftsmanship. And though she protests, saying, "Hey now, this is a fireworks shop, not an everything shop. Even I can't possibly do it all," she will still try her best to help, even if her earnings for the whole day are only enough to buy a few snacks. She'll enjoy the whole thing, too — everyone in Hanamizaka is her friend, after all.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
"The rainbows become fireworks, and they my wishes know, my wishes rise into the skies, and through the night they show."This nameless folksong has been around for a long time now. In recent years, it was misconstrued by the children to mean that as long as they brought some shiny trinkets, they could exchange them with Yoimiya for fireworks that belong just to them, and that if they lit those fireworks up, their wish will come true at some point in the future.As such, the children of Hanamizaka set about searching for beautiful little trinkets with this song on their lips, before bringing them to Yoimiya, with expectation eagarly written on their faces.Yoimiya was quite troubled by this at first, but after hearing how the children had interpreted that song, she accepted their requests gladly and even added her own spin to the tale: the "rainbows" in the song not only refer to shiny treasures persay. As long as she found them "sufficiently shiny," whether they were colored rocks from the creeks or shell fragments from the beaches, she would take them and make lovely fireworks as per the agreement.Indeed, if they were to bring her expensive things, she might, in turn, say that they are too ordinary, and take the child to look for the owner of those lost goods.But it really did not matter if the treasures were shiny or not. The important part was the conviction the children had that "rainbows" could indeed be exchanged for "fireworks."Though some might take it for naivete, Yoimiya will give her all to protect the lovely wishes that only children can have."The things we believed in and experienced as children become irreplaceable treasures."The legendary picture books of Inazuma are often filled with the following images: the cute and playful Great Mujina Youkai, the majestic Shiba Warrior, the Origami Nue who appears out of nowhere...Perhaps those who drew demons in such cute forms also had a similar intention to Yoimiya.The children gather around Yoimiya, enjoying a gladsome time even amidst Inazuma's lockdown.Yoimiya's own child-like heart and liveliness never dulls, like fireworks and stars that shimmer and shine in the night sky.Yoimiya's Candy Box: "Sweet Pearl" Friendship Lv. 4
Every festival, Yoimiya not only tries snacks from every store, but she also collects all sorts of candies, wraps them up with care, before storing them away inside a small candy box.Yoimiya's candy box is a small crimson ball that has been decorated with delicate lanyards and ornate accessories, much like the hair accessories she often wears.Each time she encounters a joyous event, she will take one candy out of the box and eat it. If her friends or the children are around, she will share the sweets with them.Yoimiya's neighbors often mistake her hair ornaments for the candy box, hence its erroneous nickname "Sweet Pearl."The speed at which the box lightens is taken for an important measure of happiness.The quicker it empties, the more pleased Yoimiya is.Sometimes, when things get busy, she sometimes absently uses the candy box as a hair accessory, realizing her mistake only after the day is done.Still, even this error would inspire Yoimiya. From then on, she would wear them interchangeably."Take a guess: does my hair ornament have candy in it today? Free pick of the sweets to anyone who gets it right!"Vision Friendship Lv. 6
Yoimiya is always up for a chat. It is only when the fireworks are ascending into the skies that she quiets down and just watches the lovely scenery.People often say that fireworks come and go in a fleeting heartbeat, but if they are memorable enough, they will remain in bloom forever in people's hearts.Those who accompanied you and the loveliness of the moment itself, will burrow deep into your mind as a beautiful memory.And as you look upon the same fireworks, many years later, that same memory and the feelings that came with it will surely rise again to the forefront of your heart.Is this not also "Eternity"?The special firework formula slips that belong solely to the Naganohara family exist for precisely this purpose.By incorporating goodwill and wishes into the gorgeous fireworks, ephemeral things are etched into eternity. This is the meaning of Yoimiya's line of work.On one summer night following her taking over Naganohara Fireworks, Yoimiya could not sleep, and thus she continued in her research till daylight came.Suddenly, she heard a tinkling sound, and a burning-red object fell into an unused launching tube.At first, Yoimiya used her Vision as a sort of lighter. Fortunately, her father discovered it and explained a Vision's significance to her.So, this tiny gem could grant a person astonishing and mysterious powers. And yet what else could it do other than protect the children or chase some mischievous monsters away?"Even if it could have other uses," Yoimiya thought, "it may not ever need to do these things in my hands. I'm just someone who pursues happiness, a fireworks-maker who enjoys living life."Time has flown since then, and Yoimiya has grown ever more skilled in the manipulation of "fire," with her skill at making fireworks having likewise increased.Sometimes, she stops to ask herself this: "How did someone as ordinary as me receive the acknowledgment of the gods? Do the gods... enjoy fireworks, by any chance?"
Obtain:Reward for reaching Friendship Level 10 with YoimiyaDescription:Even momentarily sparks can leave beautiful, unquenchable flames in the hearts of those who watch the night sky.

We have Kushikatsu, Egg Roll... Wait, no, we're not a restaurant. We make fireworks! Like these, see? Sparkling, crackling, little fireworks~

When It SnowsWhen It SnowsMedia:VO_Yoimiya When It Snows.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_When_It_Snows.ogg Haha, watch me make a snowball... pew!

When the Wind Is BlowingWhen the Wind Is BlowingMedia:VO_Yoimiya When the Wind Is Blowing.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_When_the_Wind_Is_Blowing.ogg The wind's so strong—! It's blowing my voice back at me—! Hahaha...

Good AfternoonGood AfternoonMedia:VO_Yoimiya Good Afternoon.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_Good_Afternoon.ogg Time for lunch! ... Oh my, it's an egg with a double yolk. What wonderful luck!
Good EveningGood EveningMedia:VO_Yoimiya Good Evening.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_Good_Evening.ogg Now's the best time to test our fireworks out, though I'm sure they'll look good whether they explode in the sky or on the ground... Hehe, just kidding. I'll pay attention to safety.
Good NightGood NightMedia:VO_Yoimiya Good Night.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_Good_Night.ogg Question time! So, what should you do after watching fireworks all day? Hehe, the answer is... to watch them again in your dreams, of course! Good night. See you tomorrow!
About Yoimiya: Family MattersAbout Yoimiya: Family MattersMedia:VO_Yoimiya About Yoimiya - Family Matters.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Yoimiya_-_Family_Matters.ogg My father's hearing isn't very good. When I was young, he would always smile no matter what I said to him, and so I thought that everything I said was correct. So I kept talking, and he would keep smiling. Later, I found out that he was smiling because he couldn't hear clearly, but... as long as he's truly happy, I'll keep talking to him.
About Yoimiya: Talking Friendship Lv. 4About Yoimiya: Talking Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yoimiya About Yoimiya - Talking.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Yoimiya_-_Talking.ogg I don't worry about "loose lips sinking ships." The emotions contained in the words people say don't lie. Misunderstandings that arise from saying things wrongly can be resolved if you just talk more, but if you say nothing, the other person won't understand what you mean, and they can't get closer to you.
About Us: Rock, Paper, ScissorsAbout Us: Rock, Paper, ScissorsMedia:VO_Yoimiya About Us - Rock, Paper, Scissors.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Us_-_Rock,_Paper,_Scissors.ogg Let's have a game of rock paper scissors! On my count, now — rock, paper, scissors! Woohoo, I won! I won! ... Hmm? I didn't change my choice halfway. Why would I ever do that?
About Us: Companionship Friendship Lv. 6About Us: Companionship Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Yoimiya About Us - Companionship.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Us_-_Companionship.ogg It actually doesn't matter what I do. What matters are the people I work with. When I'm with you, even simple things like watching the scenery or kicking a small jar about make me happy. Talking to you never gets old, after all.
About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yoimiya About the Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_the_Vision.ogg Let me let you in on a little secret. When I first received my Vision, I used it as a flint to light fireworks and boil water, before returning home, chucking it into a storeroom, and forgetting all about it. In the end, it was my father who found it and told me that it was a precious item that I should keep safe. Haha, at least it didn't get taken back by our dear Archon.
Something to Share: Lantern RiteSomething to Share: Lantern RiteMedia:VO_Yoimiya Something to Share - Lantern Rite.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_Something_to_Share_-_Lantern_Rite.ogg Did you know? A lot of the fireworks used during Liyue's Lantern Rite were purchased from our shop. I made them to order before asking Beidou to ship them to Liyue. Exports like these aren't allowed under the Sakoku Decree, but... How can there be festivals without fireworks?
Something to Share: CyclesSomething to Share: CyclesMedia:VO_Yoimiya Something to Share - Cycles.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_Something_to_Share_-_Cycles.ogg "When the last sparks of the fireworks have disappeared into the sky, they turn into rain and snow, and will fall upon the earth again, nourishing the land and nurturing humanity, so that someday they can be sent up into the sky again and display their magnificence." Of the many stories my father told me, this one is my favorite.
Something to Share: Spots of LightSomething to Share: Spots of LightMedia:VO_Yoimiya Something to Share - Spots of Light.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_Something_to_Share_-_Spots_of_Light.ogg Did you ever try to step on a spot of light before as a child? You know, those patches on the ground created when the sunlight passes through the leaves. I once thought that it would disappear if I stepped on it, but it would always jump onto my foot instead. I tried and tried and tried, but I never succeeded... Quite the sore loser I was, then — sitting on a rock, sighing to myself and thinking, "Ah, so there are things in this world that can't be stepped on..."
Interesting ThingsInteresting ThingsMedia:VO_Yoimiya Interesting Things.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_Interesting_Things.ogg While squatting next to some children and watching them catch goldfish during one summer festival, I suddenly had a thought: could I make fireworks that could go off on the surface of the water? Thus, the "Goldfish Fireworks" were born! They can swim here and there, emit multi-colored lights, and they can even spit bubbles! I never thought that it would actually work, but I guess wonders never cease.
About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yoimiya About Beidou.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Beidou.ogg Beidou's been helping me ship my fireworks out ever since Inazuma was locked down. I prepared a huge boat-shaped firework just to surprise her — and when the Crux Fleet was about to leave, this firework went whoosh! Right in front of their eyes, straight into the sky. The sailors got such a huge fright — they thought one of their ships had somehow flown off! But Beidou liked that trick very much, saying that it was exactly what a pleasant surprise should be — very pleasant, and a surprise.
About the Raiden Shogun Friendship Lv. 4About the Raiden Shogun Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yoimiya About the Raiden Shogun.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_the_Raiden_Shogun.ogg Fireworks are probably the furthest thing from the "eternity" that the Shogun pursues. She probably feels that their transient glory has no practical purpose in Inazuma. *sigh* It's probably something that one who has "eternity" in their grasp will find hard to comprehend. It is precisely because we mortals are like fleeting shadows that we need to treasure such flickers of beauty.
About Kamisato Ayaka: Seriousness Friendship Lv. 4About Kamisato Ayaka: Seriousness Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yoimiya About Kamisato Ayaka - Seriousness.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Kamisato_Ayaka_-_Seriousness.ogg We cooperate a lot due to work. Unlike people in the other two Commissions, she always lets me finish speaking and answers me seriously without showing any impatience. I'd say that the word "ladylike" was practically made just for her.
About Kamisato Ayaka: Baths Friendship Lv. 4About Kamisato Ayaka: Baths Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yoimiya About Kamisato Ayaka - Baths.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Kamisato_Ayaka_-_Baths.ogg We once discussed matters concerning the summer festival deep into the night. We were both really tired, and I invited her to go take a bath. But when she heard that it involved many people bathing in the same pool, she went red in an instant! That was when I first learned that noble ladies can't use public baths.
About Thoma Friendship Lv. 4About Thoma Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yoimiya About Thoma.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Thoma.ogg He's quite the talker and has reasons behind every word that he says. Sometimes, it might seem like there's no connection, but as he goes on, everything will eventually dovetail nicely towards a single purpose. It's... quite different from how I do things. I ask him for help whenever I encounter a matter I can't settle.
About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yoimiya About Yae Miko.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Yae_Miko.ogg Ayaka once asked me during a ritual at the shrine if I could prepare some fireworks for the Lady Guuji's leisure. I thought to myself, "isn't the Lady Guuji supposed to sit inside the shrine throughout the ritual?" So I watched her the whole time during the ritual, wondering how she'd like to release fireworks. I waited, and I waited, and then Ayaka came over at length to tell me that the Lady Guuji was most pleased. I mean, what? She'd already released the fireworks? Was the person sitting inside the shrine not her, then?
About Arataki Itto: Duels Friendship Lv. 4About Arataki Itto: Duels Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yoimiya About Arataki Itto - Duels.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Arataki_Itto_-_Duels.ogg Oh, he may look scary, but he is very popular with the children. However, he can be very competitive. Every time we play with the children, it always turns into a showdown between him and me. For example, we'd drink a bowl of ramen soup in one go, or try to eat sour plums without making any faces. The children will cheer us both on and try to guess the winner. And when that happens... well, then I can't let him beat me, right?
About Arataki Itto: Arataki's Gang Friendship Lv. 4About Arataki Itto: Arataki's Gang Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yoimiya About Arataki Itto - Arataki's Gang.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Arataki_Itto_-_Arataki%27s_Gang.ogg Arataki's gang? Huh!? So he isn't just someone with too much free time on his hands?
About Kaedehara Kazuha Friendship Lv. 4About Kaedehara Kazuha Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yoimiya About Kaedehara Kazuha.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Kaedehara_Kazuha.ogg People with no worries like myself speak plainly, while those with many cares often speak of ancient poetry or the scenery. They talk of flowers and birds, wind and moon, but never about the reality that confronts them. He's got quite the tale to tell, I'm sure.
About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yoimiya About Kujou Sara.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Kujou_Sara.ogg Due to public safety and fire hazard-related concerns, I often get whisked off to the Tenryou Commission's place for a lecture. Kujou Sara's probably the most reasonable of the bunch. At least she'll hear me out before passing any judgment. If I'm in the right, she'll acknowledge my perspective, and if I'm wrong... Hehe, then I'll get Thoma to come and help me apologize to her!
About Sayu Friendship Lv. 4About Sayu Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yoimiya About Sayu.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Sayu.ogg Let me know if you see her, alright? I'd really love to take her to one of the festivals and introduce her to lots of new friends. She always looks a little down, but if she meets some people she can hang out with, maybe she'll slowly pick herself up again!
About Klee Friendship Lv. 4About Klee Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yoimiya About Klee.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Klee.ogg Wait, you said there was a kid in Mondstadt who was good at making bombs?... Now, they aren't much different from fireworks. In other words, she might be a genius... Ohh, I'd love to meet her. *sigh* But isn't it dangerous to let children play with explosives? Don't the people of Mondstadt worry about that?
About Kirara Friendship Lv. 4About Kirara Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yoimiya About Kirara.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_About_Kirara.ogg The courier from Komaniya Express? She's super reliable and really quick on her feet! Ingredients used in coloring the fireworks always run out quickly, but she always delivers a new batch right when I need them! I gave her a firework once as a thank-you gift, but she was too scared to light it, saying that she got spooked once by the sound of fireworks. Hehe, so I told her to find a nice viewing spot far away and set it off for her.

Alright, alright. Sit here, and I shall tell you the story I'm most proud of — the story of the Naganohara family! You'll rarely ever hear me talk about something this serious, you know?

Its contents can only be understood by our family, and it records the specific formula of the fireworks that were ordered. Whether ten years or a hundred years pass, our family can make exactly the same fireworks as they did in the past so long as the client brings us that note.

Tiny little emotions that can easily slip away are captured within these fireworks and passed down in a different form. The notes we give our clients are like a key that awaits those who wish to open a gate to commemorate the past. We at Naganohara are the keepers of that gate.
More About Yoimiya: IV Friendship Lv. 5More About Yoimiya: IV Friendship Lv. 5Media:VO_Yoimiya More About Yoimiya - 04.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_More_About_Yoimiya_-_04.ogg Every moment of the summer festival is a moving tale. Those who meet under the light of fireworks grow up, mature, and grow old. When they set off the same fireworks as they did in the beginning, the skies reflect that same image from years ago... Fireworks are not eternal, but I believe that the wonderful emotions behind them should walk alongside Inazuma into eternity.

Instead, let's watch the fireworks together in silence. You can record the beautiful scenery and all the things you wanna say down. Not that this is the end, of course. On the contrary, I believe that our story is only just beginning.

Wait, that doesn't count? Well then, let me think. Um... This one's a toughie. I like to chat with the neighbors, I like going to summer festivals with the children, swimming, picking wild fruits... Oh, I can't decide which I like most... Wait, I've got it! I love playing with everyone!

Favorite FoodFavorite FoodMedia:VO_Yoimiya Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_Favorite_Food.ogg I prefer snacks to entrees. I always go from stall to stall during festivals, eating as I go. By the way, are you any good at making snacks? I'll trade the dango I made with you. Here, have the big ones!
Least Favorite FoodLeast Favorite FoodMedia:VO_Yoimiya Least Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_Least_Favorite_Food.ogg Ugh... Milk never fails to start some real fireworks in my stomach — crackle, kaboom! Y'know what I mean? But I can handle dishes and snacks made with milk for some reason, hmm. Maybe the little Seelie in my stomach is just pickier than most.

You should totally set up a stall at a festival some time, oh it'd be a hit for sure!

BirthdayBirthdayMedia:VO_Yoimiya Birthday.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yoimiya_Birthday.ogg Birthdays are never occasions for yourself alone. Those who send you cakes, light candles, applaud, and cheer... They are all truly thankful that you were born into this world. That's why it must be a lively occasion, so that everyone can get their chance to thank you! Well then — happy birthday! Are you ready? I'm about to ignite the fireworks!

Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Yoimiya: Pretty good! I'm surprised how awesome your place is!
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Yoimiya: This is an adeptus relic from Liyue, right? It's incredible. I thought you were joking when you asked me to get into this pot.
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Yoimiya: I had no idea what to say, I didn't know if I should object or just follow along...
 What was your objection going to be?
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship1 04a 1.ogg Yoimiya: Something like, "Are you blind? I can't squeeze into that!"
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship1 04a 2.ogg Yoimiya: Haha, Paimon told me that she had the same reaction when she first saw the pot.
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship1 04a 3.ogg Yoimiya: If she couldn't get in, there would be no chance for me.
 What would you have said to humor me?
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship1 04b 1.ogg Yoimiya: Like, "Let me send over 'Tarou the Goldfish,' the most trusty fish in my aquarium, to accompany you!"
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship1 04b 2.ogg Yoimiya: I'm sure it'll be able to get in. It's a goldfish after all.

Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Yoimiya: Sure, you know I love to talk. Let me think, is there anything interesting going on these days...
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Yoimiya: Ah, right. You've got such a large piece of paradise here. Do you have any plans for it, you know, besides just living here?
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Yoimiya: Ever thought about building a parlor or a show room? Or maybe a training ground?
 I'd love to do some business like you.
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship2 04a 1.ogg Yoimiya: Wha—? There might have been a slight misunderstanding, you see, my family's business is not the usual kind of business.
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship2 04a 2.ogg Yoimiya: I know merchants in Liyue are really good at making Mora, they're experts at landing deals both big and small.
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship2 04a 3.ogg Yoimiya: However, our family's customers are mostly regulars, so we put most of our focus on those relationships.
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship2 04a 4.ogg Yoimiya: My pops and I, we mainly do business so that we won't let everyone down.

Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship2 04b 3.ogg Yoimiya: Thanks to the family business, I've got tons of connections. Haha!
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship2 04b 4.ogg Yoimiya: Well, I guess I can't get you the stars, or the moon. But pretty much anything else.
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Yoimiya: Anyway, when it's finished, let me know. I'll set off some fireworks to celebrate.

Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Yoimiya: There is always a reason for everything. For example, I like to talk because when I was a kid, Pops really seemed to enjoy listening to me.

Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Yoimiya: Starting from Mondstadt, to Liyue, and then to Inazuma... I will go see the sights you've seen and meet the people you've come across.
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Yoimiya: That's what one has to do if they want to get to know someone completely!
Media:vo yoimiya mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Yoimiya: Sorry, I don't mean to put any pressure on you. I was just, well... how should I put it? Simply, I...
