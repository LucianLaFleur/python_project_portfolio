She is a mysterious person who claims to work for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, but comes out as a non-entity on their list. She also claims to work for the Yanshang Teahouse, but only uses it for her true job, an intelligence agent collaborating with Ningguang.
Yelan's outfit. It has lurked alongside its wearer in the shadows over many a year, to the point where the outfit almost has a mysterious temper of its own, like an orchid blooming at midnight.
Unlocked upon obtaining character
The Waning Point is Yelan's Default Character Outfit.
Yelan's attire consists of a blue qipao-like overcoat and a dark bodysuit embellished with silver details. Her attire is decorated with a number of trinkets and accessories, including white bracelets on her arms and a number of chokers and necklaces around her neck from which a charm resembling a die hangs. In addition to this, Yelan keeps a furred white coat hanging from the back of her outfit somewhat resembling a cape and sports a pair of thigh-high boots that leave a part of her thigh exposed, where her Hydro Vision is attached. Yelan also sports a pair of white blue-tipped earrings resembling teardrops.

A mysterious person who claims to work for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, but is a "non-entity" on the Ministry of Civil Affairs' list.Elusive, enigmatic, erratic - all of these are Yelan's hallmarks.—Description from the Official Website[1]
A mysterious person who claims to work for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, but is a "non-entity" on the Ministry of Civil Affairs' List.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Yelan is said to be quite secretive and mysterious; while claiming to work for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, she's frequently absent from work most of the year. Despite this, Ningguang tolerates her general absence while Keqing appreciates her work, although the latter wonders as to where she gets her intelligence from. She employs psychological tactics to catch her targets and get all the information she needs from them.
Outside of work, Yelan approaches life at a calm and carefree pace. She frequently enjoys napping whenever possible, but will adjust her schedule as needed for the day's tasks. The reason for this is because of her physical frailty, a hereditary trait within her family. When handling particularly troublesome cases, she tries to save up her energy to complete everything in a single go.
In the presence of others, she is said to be very pleasant and polite. When alone, she's said to show a far different side of her as an extremely reliable, powerful and intelligent woman. She also has a high tolerance for spice, eating raw or dried Jueyun Chilis after deeming Xiangling's spiciest dish not enough for her. She dislikes sweets, claiming that they're too easy to get addicted to and disrupts focus.
Yelan uses the tall female model. She has pale skin, light emerald-green eyes, and dark blue hair and asymmetrical bangs that are lighter at the tips.
The world is vast and infinite, the solitary one comes and goes as she pleases
Oh, you're looking for Yelan? Hmm, I'd like to suggest that you treat her as an ordinary person, but if you do, it's easy to lose control over negotiations. There are some things that really depend on her impression of you.—Yanfei
Yelan's identity has always been a mystery.
Like a phantom, she often appears in various guises at the center of events, and disappears before the storm stops.
The people who are caught up in trouble look forward to meeting her. For some reason, most of them think she will help them, and if not, they want her to be their ally.
But the problem is, their opponents harbor the same idea.
Every one of these people has met a Yelan who goes by a different name and identity, and each of them thinks they can reach a partnership with her. However, everyone has been kept in the dark.
Who does she want to help? When will she tell the truth?
Once she acts and intervenes, nothing can be trusted.
When she reveals her true identity and speaks the truth, those who are eager for answers may not have the chance to hear it.
Liyue's Ministry of Civil Affairs is an organization marked by transparency — from ordinary staff members of the Eight Trades to prominent officials of Yujing Terrace, every employee has their basic information documented in the Ministry's lists.Yelan, despite claiming to work for the Ministry, is the sole exception. Most of her colleagues have never heard of her, nor is her name anywhere to be found on any rosters.This does say something about her character — elusive, enigmatic, and erratic.She is a ghost who walks in the middle of many crises under various names. But before the storms can come to an end, she has already disappeared without a trace.Sometimes, she will pick a side in some conflict to offer her help, but those who receive her aid would be fools to celebrate prematurely, for they soon find that the same help has been extended to their opponents.Having stepped into her trap, many have vowed to take revenge, yet none are able to tell what she is planning, let alone know where she stands.Many believe that she is a spy who works for some mysterious organization, and that her forte is stirring things up in the dark, which she then relies on to attain what she wants.Some even go as far as saying that she is a frenetic follower of disorder who neither serves any organization nor holds any meaningful purposes.Even if she does, all she wants is to add fuel to the already spreading flame and drag everyone down into a world of madness created by her.With so many theories and guesses circulating, she has become a mystery. As for the truth, you could only hope to get an answer from Yelan herself.But unfortunately, this is no easy task either — for it is always she who finds you when she wishes to, not the other way around.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Pharmacies in Liyue Harbor occasionally receive curious patients.On some days, it might be a Sumeru mercenary, on other days, a Fontaine adventurer, and there might even be some Mondstadt fisher who accidentally fell into water and bumped her head against a rock...These people are of different ages, statuses, and origins, but there is something equally peculiar to them, that is, they all share a slight addiction to pain.They like the stinging sensation when pharmacists apply herbal remedies to their wounds and enjoy the dull pain caused by pressure on their bruises.They even seem to care little if anesthetic is used or not when they are put through painful therapies.Surprised by their extraordinary endurance, novice pharmacists are sufficiently distracted, such that they fail to notice that all their patients are actually the same person.They are, all of them, Yelan in disguise. A master in this art, she always manages to avoid attention.As for the wounds on her person, these are the inevitable result of her constant exposure to danger from mission to mission.Despite the curious job, Yelan herself is not very curious about the world.She eats, sleeps, and lives just like everyone else, but few things can really pique her interest.She is well-read, but she is no avid reader. She always knows what to say to achieve the best result, yet she takes no pleasure in playing mind games.She travels far and roams the lands, yet the traveling and roaming are bland to her.In Yelan's eyes, these things are not hobbies, but a means to an end.She even prefers to roll the dice to decide how she will pass the time.Just as someone who is so used to spicy food might lose the ability to enjoy ordinary dishes, Yelan finds that only spicy cuisine can bring her satisfaction."Blandness is synonymous with blindness, while thrills afford clarity."Acting upon said philosophy, she chooses an acute style of life, venturing into many places while hiding in the shadows.She dances with danger, secrets, and a strong sense of achievement — these are the vivid proof of her existence.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
Shorn of her masks, Yelan is a special intelligence officer who reports directly to the Tianquan Ningguang.The title itself is not entirely accurate, for it only covers the scope of her work but not her relationship with the Tianquan.Deep in her heart, Yelan does not think of herself as anyone's subordinate. The way she sees it, she is not so much working for Ningguang as making good on her end of the deal, or rather... she is honoring a certain pact.She plucks the fruits of intelligence from the tree of danger for Ningguang, and in return, all she asks for is danger itself and the sense of achievement.None know when their collaboration began.The only thing certain is that Yelan has long made her presence felt in lands outside Liyue.From other nations in Teyvat to even the perilous Abyss...Every secret and perilous demesne shall become a garden where orchids bloom.Stealthily she roams the night, stars shining upon her in the skies.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Yelan spends much of her time patrolling and roaming The Chasm, where she often stares into the darkness deep below.Her family's history dates far back into an ancient age, and her ancestors once fought in The Chasm against a great cataclysm.Wanton death was dealt during that battle, and even a yaksha met their end there. Only a few survived the grueling bloodshed.One of her ancestors died, while the other went insane, constituting a huge blow to her family.Yelan has always wanted to find out what happened back then. Despite her better judgment, she can't help feeling attracted to The Chasm.It almost feels like something that runs in her blood — something inexplicably ominous — has been summoning her to The Chasm.Perhaps she will plunge into that darkness one day, and the ill fate that once befell her ancestors shall find her too.The ominous calling that runs in the family shuts down her fear and turns on her craving for danger. This may be the reason for the peculiarities in her character, Yelan presumed.She had never doubted it until she came of age, until the seal on The Chasm was lifted.With the help of her companions, she unveiled the hidden past of her ancestors.That moment marked a new chapter in her life:In the past, she was a wild beast driven by pure instinct. Drawn to danger, she walked into darkness.From that moment on, she has found the true meaning of her instinct.That which hides inside her, that constant calling, is not only a source of worry but also a light of guidance.It is the blood of heroes which has been howling for 500 years.She has no fear, for the courage within her makes her strong. She craves danger, for the heir of heroes is meant for a great adventure.Some day, she will embark on the path her ancestors once took.She is the descendant of heroes, and she shall become the hero for many who will come after her.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
The Ministry of Civil Affairs has a Special Attention List.The list isn't long, but everyone on it is truly extraordinary:For instance, the unbound and forthright leader of the armed fleet and the capable outland traveler with a broad range of skills.The list even includes some reclusive adepti in Liyue whose names still bear great weight today...These people could easily bring storms upon Liyue, their intentions notwithstanding.As such, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, ever on guard against risk, still watches them closely.On top of that, there is also a more classified Secret Intelligence List.Those on it are the real threats to Liyue.So who are they exactly?The Fatui Harbingers? Figures from the Abyss Order?Or perhaps, are even the names of gods listed there?Other than the Qixing, Yelan is likely to be the only one who can answer these questions, for she is the very person who compiled the two lists.The results of such work please her greatly, and day after day, she perfects the lists, as crows embellishing their nests with shining trinkets.That said, while both are equally obsessed with collecting, Yelan must sweat and even bleed to secure what she is after, while crows need only flap their wings to achieve their aim.Fortunately, this does not bother her at all, for she believes that the intelligence is worth whatever cost she is going to pay.One day, the information will come in handy — Liyue will never plunge into disaster without any clue of the danger like it once did 500 years ago.She will see to it that Liyue is not caught unprepared.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6  •  Perilous Trail
Don't play dice at Yanshang Teahouse.If you can't help yourself, play with someone you know.If a lady whom you've never seen before invites you to a game, just ignore her.Heed this earnest advice from veteran gamblers.Do not try your luck with that terrifying woman unless you want to have a gloomy day.The invincible lady of Yanshang Teahouse is none other than Yelan herself, and one of her guises is that of the owner of this teahouse.A while ago when she came back from abroad, Liyue had just weathered the Osial crisis, and the Fatui who had occupied Yanshang Teahouse were now largely out of the game.Yelan seized the opportunity to take it over, turning the teahouse into a secret base.On the one hand, with people from all walks of life to be found here, the teahouse serves as an ideal source of intel. On the other hand, as Yelan has no issue with occasionally giving herself a break, she will pretend to be a regular customer, drinking some tea and playing a few rounds of some game.Every round of finger-guessing is a tiny adventure, and every roll of dice sends sporadic thrills down her spine. Even the smallest challenge is something she can never get enough of.As an intelligence operative, Yelan takes pride in her skills — she is confident that she can read her opponents' eyes and roll the dice such that they fall outside the rules but well within her designs.If there is a draw, that could only mean one thing: Her opponents are cheating too.Don't try to reason with her. The very concept of "reasoning" is simply foreign to the Yanshang Teahouse, nor does it exist in Yelan's vocabulary.Be good and choose between the pain of losing and the disgrace of cheating.You want to have neither, huh? Then why don't you turn the clock back to the very beginning? Don't play dice at Yanshang Teahouse!The Fascinating Bracelet and the Whitesilk Mantle Friendship Lv. 4  •  Perilous Trail
Throughout Yelan's intelligence career so far, there has been one memorable operation that fuses both failure and success together.One could say that it was a failure because she lost a family heirloom named the "Fascinating Bracelet" during that operation.The inside of the jade bracelet is engraved with a spell passed through her line that turns the heirloom into a simple communication device. However, the spell requires a pair of such vessels to work. Now that only one bracelet is left, it is no more than a mere accessory.However, the operation also proved a success for Yelan because her enemy did not get the upper hand, either. And this enemy of hers was no ordinary character — it was none other than "Regrator," Ninth of the Fatui Harbingers.Yelan infiltrated a secret trade route that was run by Regrator behind the scenes, intercepting the goods and picking the most precious one of them as compensation for her bracelet.Now, there once existed a strange mystical beast in times of old. A robe made from its fur would be worth a fortune, and due to its rarity, such a robe is exceptionally hard to procure.In fact, the beast is so powerful that although it died centuries ago, its body remains intact today, and its fur still emits a mysterious fragrance.Regrator had intended it as an offer to the Tsaritsa, yet Yelan unexpectedly intercepted it.Not only that, she also rejected the style that Snezhnayans had chosen for their Tsaritsa — she yanked the fur off, combined it with Liyue's Ramie yarn, and made a rather fashionable sleeved mantle for herself.This series of happenings could be seen as significant or insignificant — depending on one's perspective. Ultimately, it all boils down to three words: gains and losses.The cycle of gaining and losing is a rather accurate summary of Yelan's life.None of that really bothers her though. Instead, she takes immense pleasure from it.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
Yelan wasn't always on her own. Many years ago, she once had a team who watched each others' backs.There were a small group of people who for various reasons chose to tread a path in the dark with her.But back then, Yelan had not yet realized that her clever tricks and ingenious traps, the skills that she took pride in, could not solve everything for her.Enemies with a strong sense of self-control would not bite her bait, opponents with cunning and calculating minds would not fall for her schemes, and those with overwhelming power would simply strong-arm their way out of her traps.Therefore, Yelan and her team paid the price — one by one, they perished along the way, though they had long foreseen and prepared themselves for such a fate...Still, after a mission to investigate the Abyss, Yelan eventually found herself left alone. For the first time in her life, she stopped, for a long, long time.This state of affairs persisted until one day, when Ningguang visited her in her wood hut personally."You haven't been back to Liyue Harbor for a while. Something must've happened. I can understand if you want to quit."Ningguang stood outside the door, with a serious look on her face but her voice still casual and relaxed."But it's alright. I work with those I trust, and I trust those I work with. I'm willing to believe that you're here trying to find a way out. All postures, aggressive or defensive, are all means to an end, anyway."There was no response, but only a suffocating silence. A long time passed before Ningguang finally heard an answer from behind her:"We both made a mistake: We shouldn't have involved ordinary folk in what we do.""Ordinary folk?"Even as Ningguang was formulating thoughts, a flash of blue shot towards her, stopping as it passed her by.In a display of great control from the archer, the arrow quickly shattered into pearls of water and broke into glistening shards of light before touching the ground.Ningguang turned around and saw Yelan walking up, a bow in hand, blood dripping down from her fingertips.One could only imagine the days and nights of grueling training in archery Yelan had gone through for all her fingers to bleed.Knowing Yelan well, Ningguang also understood that she must have been through an uncommonly tough situation. Only that could explain Yelan's uncommon determination to lock herself up for this grueling re-training.Yelan aimed at the mountain in the distance, a gesture that was also an answer to Ningguang.She released the arrow. Like lightning it shot into the skies, piercing through clouds with might that could shatter the dome of heaven itself. As if responding to the call of an unknown power, waters in the mountains growled and howled, then swirled their way upward in the form of countless arrows.When they met halfway in the sky, they exploded into a curtain of water, bringing down a squalling shower like those that adorned summer nights.As the sky cleared, there was no rainbow, no butterflies to be seen, only a faint pillar of light that fell into Yelan's palm.According to Ningguang, the Vision carries a message: "From today onward, leave all matters to the extraordinary Yelan."
Obtain:Reward for reaching Friendship Level 10 with YelanDescription:"Dice are always quite hard to make 'fair.' That goes double for dice with shoddier workmanship. The weighting on each numbered side will almost certainly be unbalanced."

Come Have Some Tea (2023-04-20)A Few Fresh Flowers... (2024-04-20)
Yelan's name, 夜兰/夜蘭 Yèlán means "night orchid."
The Chinese name of her constellation, 幽客座 Yōukè-zuò, literally means the "Shadowy Guest Constellation." The character 幽 yōu can also be alternately translated as "remote," "concealed," or "tranquil."
In Imperial China, 幽客 was another term for hermit scholars (隐士/隱士 yǐnshì).
This may also be a reference to the Chinese literary work 西溪丛语/西溪叢語 Xīxī Cóngyǔ, "Collected Sayings of the Western Creek", written by the Song Dynasty scholar Yao Kuan (姚宽), which has a section describing thirty flowers as thirty types of guests. In it, orchids are called 幽客 "shadowy guests."[2]
Yelan's Chinese title, 兰生幽谷/蘭生幽谷 Lán Shēng Yōugǔ, "Orchid Grows in the Dark Ravine" is derived from the idiom 兰生幽谷，不以无人而不芳/蘭生幽谷，不以無人而不芳 lit. "Orchids growing in the dark ravine will not cease their fragrance for a lack of people."

What's that look on your face for? You don't have to be on guard around me. I never scheme against people who have my stamp of approval.
About Us: Deception Friendship Lv. 6About Us: Deception Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Yelan About Us - Deception.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yelan_About_Us_-_Deception.ogg Don't be too ready to believe people when they cross their heart and hope to die. Sweet talkers only say what you want to hear. And think twice before meeting someone else's gaze — your eyes speak volumes about what you're thinking. When it comes down to it, we're friends, and if somebody ever conned you, I'd feel like I'd been cheated, too.
About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yelan About the Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yelan_About_the_Vision.ogg Wherever there's important information to be found, the stakes involved in extracting it are often fatal. It doesn't matter how big or reliable the team under you may be, you can never completely rule out the risk. The bottom line is, have enough force at your fingertips to control the situation. I got lucky — I got my Vision just a few days after realizing that. Otherwise... you'd probably be talking to a very disheveled-looking ghost right now.

They're very sound-proof — you can sleep away blissfully even when there's someone screaming right in your ear... Of course, I hope for your sake that you don't ever need them for that kind of reason.

I suppose there's no harm in telling you... It contains a kind of magic used by our clan, and it can send simple messages. The meaning of those messages is buried in the blue light, and only I can decipher them.

In the process of trying to shake me off, they will start to panic, bring in reinforcements, alter their plan... they keep going like this until eventually, they've exposed everything I need to know. Heh...
Interesting ThingsInteresting ThingsMedia:VO_Yelan Interesting Things.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yelan_Interesting_Things.ogg Do you know much about Weasel Thieves? They're not especially intelligent creatures, but once you tame them, they can be trained to steal things and even pick locks. Pretty clear-cut case, isn't it — if even animals can be used as pawns with the right methods, the same has to be all the more true of people, who are constantly plotting and scheming against one another to begin with.
About Ningguang: Relationship Friendship Lv. 4About Ningguang: Relationship Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yelan About Ningguang - Relationship.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yelan_About_Ningguang_-_Relationship.ogg I got to know Ningguang a long time ago, before she was a Qixing, and we worked together for a while. Maybe I'm partly to thank for the fact that she became a Qixing so quickly. Hehe, who can say? Anyway, she was the one who recommended this job to me. It was a good choice, I'm very well-suited to it.

But I have to be mindful of our identities when I'm out in public. When I meet a Qixing as an employee of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, they're "Sir" or "Lady" to me.

I could never work non-stop like she does, certainly not at that level of efficiency. I guess being half-adeptus must have its perks. Imagine not needing sleep to regain your energy levels...
About Keqing Friendship Lv. 4About Keqing Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yelan About Keqing.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yelan_About_Keqing.ogg I don't really like people who cram their schedules full, because it doesn't leave any room for negotiation. If something happens that they didn't anticipate, it throws their plans into oblivion, impacting not just themselves but their coworkers, too. But the Yuheng is different. She works in a very methodical way. I always enjoy working with her.
About Yanfei Friendship Lv. 4About Yanfei Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yelan About Yanfei.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yelan_About_Yanfei.ogg I like Yanfei a lot. And I'm not talking about our friendship — as a high-profile legal consultant, important intel in Liyue Harbor is constantly flowing in her direction. Whenever I help her out, I always get some invaluable leads in return. I gotta say though, sometimes I think she respects me a little too much.
About Xiao Friendship Lv. 4About Xiao Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yelan About Xiao.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yelan_About_Xiao.ogg The elders in my clan once said that we must always show the utmost respect to the Vigilant Yaksha. Apparently, the only time that our ancestor would gain some temporary relief from his insanity was when passing by the Wangshu Inn. It must have been the comforting effect of his presence that wards off evil spirits. That said, if I ever have the honor of fighting side by side with the Conqueror of Demons, I will focus only on the mission. I cannot let myself be distracted by concerns about his status.
About Xiangling Friendship Lv. 4About Xiangling Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yelan About Xiangling.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yelan_About_Xiangling.ogg Ah, Xiangling, the lovely little chef. Her ingredients are always top quality, easily as good as Liuli Pavilion and Xinyue Kiosk. Sometimes I go to her for dried Jueyun Chilis... She doesn't seem to understand why I eat them in the way that I do, and I don't feel like trying to explain it to her, either. It's just a family tradition.
About Xingqiu Friendship Lv. 4About Xingqiu Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yelan About Xingqiu.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yelan_About_Xingqiu.ogg Of course I remember him — the young master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild. I have dealings with his family all the time. Who knows... maybe one day, he'll be outsmarting everyone around him, too.
About Tartaglia Friendship Lv. 4About Tartaglia Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yelan About Tartaglia.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yelan_About_Tartaglia.ogg The Fatui harbinger? He helped me out once — unwittingly. I was planning a deep-reaching investigation into the former owner of the Yanshang Teahouse, but our harbinger friend got to him first. He showed up demanding payment of his debt, and also exposed his accounting fraud, which got him thrown in jail. That made it very easy for me to take over Yanshang Teahouse myself, and it's proven to be a very useful base.

Thanks to my family's connections, I learned some useful skills from the Millelith scouts very early on. Although there are things working against you every step of the way when you're gathering intelligence, as long as I keep myself alive, I'll always emerge as the winner in the end...

You have to trace them all the way back to where everything began before there can be a resolution. To that end, I need to keep my eyes and ears on every part of society, and often, that means having to be more than one person. People sometimes describe me as "one person, many faces" and so on... I take it as a compliment.

Dig too deep and you might find yourself standing in your own grave, they say... Well, I'm not about to stop, least of all because of anything anyone else has to say. Sure, I can't change the facts, but if it's a choice between the cold, hard truth and blissful unawareness, I'll take the former. What about you? Which would you choose?

If I'm gonna stay around, what kind of person do you want me to be to you? Someone you work with? A competitor, who challenges you to sharpen your game? Just another name on your long list of acquaintances, or... somebody more important than that? Depending on what you're hoping for, I can either play that part or become that person.
Yelan's HobbiesYelan's HobbiesMedia:VO_Yelan Hobbies.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yelan_Hobbies.ogg In my free time, I live life completely at random. It's quite simple: I make a list of things to do, then I roll the dice to decide which one I'm going to do next. It's a surprisingly fun game, and it's really broadened my mind... in that sense, it's been quite helpful where my job is concerned.
Yelan's TroublesYelan's TroublesMedia:VO_Yelan Troubles.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yelan_Troubles.ogg My physical fitness isn't actually that great compared with some trained martial artists. It's a hereditary thing that runs in my family. So before getting into really important work, I adjust my schedule to make sure I get enough rest, wait till I have built up enough energy, then strive to finish everything that needs doing in one go. Outside of work, I try my best to live life at a calm and carefree pace. So I'll always decline to take on any strenuous physical labor.
Favorite FoodFavorite FoodMedia:VO_Yelan Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yelan_Favorite_Food.ogg I like to grind dried Jueyun Chilis and Violetgrass stamens into powder, mix them in with some Yunlai White Tea leaves, and then brew a strong pot of tea. It has the most powerful fragrance that makes you instantly fall in love with it. I prefer drinks like this with a long-lasting aftertaste to things like coffee and spirits.
Least Favorite FoodLeast Favorite FoodMedia:VO_Yelan Least Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yelan_Least_Favorite_Food.ogg You have to be very careful with sweets. That powerful sense of satisfaction... it weakens your willpower and makes you relaxed. It only takes a few bites to get addicted, and with long-term consumption, you'll slowly but surely lose your edge.

So, relax and take it easy today. Oh, and you should stop by the Yanshang Teahouse — I whipped up some treats especially for you. Not sweet ones, of course. Just the tiniest little hint of chili.

Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Yelan: Not bad. The courtyard furnishings are very nice, and the scenery in the distance is really one of a kind.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Yelan: So yeah, I think I'm gonna enjoy my time off here.
 Where do you usually spend your down time?
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Yelan: In my own home, of course.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Yelan: My home's located some way outside of the city, in a very quiet and peaceful area.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Yelan: Hehe... judging by the look on your face, I'm guessing you've fallen for the rumors about me being very wealthy and having high demands for my standards of living?
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Yelan: Seeing isn't always believing, and if you can't trust your eyes, you certainly can't trust rumors.
 Being away from the hustle and bustle has its benefits...
 Perhaps it helps with your work...

Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship1 08.ogg Yelan: If you live far enough out in the sticks, you have plenty of legitimate reasons to ditch work. The mountain path was blocked, or you ran into some Treasure Hoarders en route...
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship1 09.ogg Yelan: Not to mention that if you live in a packed and bustling city, it's much easier for people to trace your steps. This creates all kinds of issues, and gets in the way of my ability to track my targets.
 Interesting, I hadn't considered that.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship1 10.ogg Yelan: That said, since I'm free to come and go as I please here, it would be a terrible waste for me to not use it as a backup base.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship1 11.ogg Yelan: You wouldn't mind that, would you?
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Yelan: I would be delighted.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Yelan: We should make some tea, too. Sipping tea, chatting, and just enjoying the time off, it's a great way to recharge.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Yelan: Hey, you're friendly with "Rain Calmer," aren't you? I hear she's a tea drinker, too. Why don't you treat me to some choice tea from her personal collection?
 You should go earn her trust yourself.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Yelan: Heh, I'm just pulling your leg. She let me try some of her tea already, and we had a lovely chat.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Yelan: The key to making sure a conversation goes well is choosing the right topic.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Yelan: For chatting with you... let's go with tracking techniques, ambush essentials, expanding your network of contacts, and setting up lookouts.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Yelan: Hehe. Well, if you were just looking to shoot the breeze with me, I can get on board with that, too.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Yelan: You know me — role-playing's one of my biggest strengths.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Yelan: ...Seriously, though, I think the topics I mentioned are the ones really worth sharing with you.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Yelan: The things I've learned come from a mix of secret techniques taught by the Millelith Scouts, real-life cases of competition in the business world, and the experience of various overseas organizations.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship2 11.ogg Yelan: For someone like you, this knowledge is going to come in handy sooner or later.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship2 12.ogg Yelan: Once you've mastered it, you'll be able to avoid being pushed around by those in the know.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship2 13.ogg Yelan: Anyway, just remember to come to me if you ever want to improve in these areas. I'll teach you everything I know.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Yelan: Isn't this your time off? You should do something that isn't too mentally taxing.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Yelan: Oh, I have some dice in my pocket. Why don't we have a little fun?
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Yelan: I'll roll the dice, and the score decides who confesses.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Yelan: If I roll a one, three, or five, you have to confess. You have to tell me... a secret that no one else can ever be allowed to know.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Yelan: If it's two, four, or six, then I'll be the one who has to reveal an important secret to you. What do you say?
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship3 06a 1.ogg Yelan: In other words, you still have some reservations towards me.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship3 06a 2.ogg Yelan: But the good news is, you passed the test. The fact that you'll keep some cards close to your chest even in front of a major ally actually makes me more confident in you.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship3 06a 3.ogg Yelan: Maybe you'll make a successful intelligence agent yourself one day. I'm excited to go up against you.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship3 06b 1.ogg Yelan: Oh? So you really want to play, despite there being a fifty-fifty chance of losing?
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship3 06b 2.ogg Yelan: Or is it that you're willing to take a gamble for the sake of finding out my secrets?
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship3 06b 3.ogg Yelan: Interesting. I was going to pull a little trick, but now even I'm looking forward to this.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo friendship3 06b 4.ogg Yelan: Hehe... Then let round one begin.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo morning 01.ogg Yelan: Morning... this is early for me, but you seem pretty peppy.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo morning 02.ogg Yelan: You don't seem to have much going on right now, though, so I think I'll go ahead and snooze a while longer.
Media:vo yelan mimitomo night 01.ogg Yelan: Good night to you too, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo yelan mimitomo night 02.ogg Yelan: I'll keep working for a little while longer. My mind's at peak efficiency at this hour, so it's the perfect time to go through the clues and piece everything together...

Media:vo mimitomo ly yelan village 01.ogg Yelan: This house is similar to a place in Southwest Minlin that I lived in for a while.
Media:vo mimitomo ly yelan village 02.ogg Yelan: Minlin... now that was a smooth operation. Thinking back on it puts me in a good mood.
Media:vo mimitomo ly yelan village 03.ogg Yelan: I should go back and give that place a spring-clean sometime. Never know when it might prove useful again...
