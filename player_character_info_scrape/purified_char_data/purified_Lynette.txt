Quiet and reserved, Lynette functions as a magician's assistant to her brother Lyney. After their parents' death and having been saved from an abusive noble by their "Father," Lynette has also served as "eyes" and "ears" for the House of the Hearth.

A magician's assistant hidden in the shadows who refers to herself as a "Multi-Function Magic Assistant." Poker-faced, reticent to speak, and as unpredictable in her movements as a cat.—Description from the Official Website[1]
A magic assistant of few words, her emotions are as inscrutable as any cat's.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Compared to her siblings Lyney and Freminet, Lynette is the most reserved of the three. She rarely talks to others out of her own accord, letting Lyney do the talking for her, and dissuades essentially any attempt to speak with her by saying bizarre responses. Whenever she needs to talk, she speaks briefly and frankly.
Due to a rare case of atavism, Lynette has feline features and traits, such as enjoying fish. She also has a habit of breaking and/or damaging machines, resulting her not using them frequently. Lynette enjoys making and drinking tea, though her sensitive tongue results in her having to cool it down first before drinking.
As a result of her traumatic past with Lyney, Lynette does not trust most people lest they take advantage of them, seeing her brother as a truth in a world full of lies and falsehoods. Like Lyney, she keeps her ties with the Fatui discreet.
Lynette uses the medium female model. She is a young woman with purple eyes, pale skin, and light grayish-brown hair tied into a low, thin ponytail which extends down her back. She has blunt bangs swept to her left, a short braid along the right side of her head, and two sections of hair which frame her face, curling inwards towards her chin. Additionally, she has cat-like ears, and a cat’s tail. She also has a small, dark brown star-shaped mark on her left cheek, mirroring her brother’s teardrop mark on his opposite cheek.
The firmament glimpsed in a reflected moon
That's already the fifth time this month... Haven't you learned not to mess with Lynette?—Words muttered by Freminet to a vacuum cleaner, overheard by Lyney as he left his room in the dead of night.
In direct contrast to her older brother, who refers to himself as "the greatest magician in all Teyvat", Lynette might possibly be the lowest-profile Magician's Assistant in the land.
She seeks neither flowers nor applause, avoids interviews, and generally tries to avoid notice.
Whether people are trying to attract her attention or simply curious, she shuts them out with bizarre responses like "Entering Standby Mode" and "I need to space out."
Even when bigwigs from the audience pay them a private visit, Lynette always takes a back seat and lets Lyney do the talking. She prefers to brew a pot of tea and sit in the corner, looking down as she quietly sips away, apparently uninterested by the conversation.
Only the very few among them, in the briefest of interludes, sense for a millisecond that they are being secretly watched. But by the time they try to locate the source of the gaze, it has already vanished without a trace.
Yet the only other people in the room are Lyney – warm and hospitable as ever – and Lynette, whose undivided attention is being bestowed upon a teacup.
...Perhaps it was just their imagination.
...But even if not, what harm could a quick glance have done? It's not like they could have seen anything of any significance... could they?
The firmament glimpsed in a reflected moon
You needn't fret, nor should you feel like you have to change your own habits. But you should know that genuine understanding can only be found, not sought. A true companion is someone who can read your 'signals.—Arlecchino
In their little team of three at the Hotel Bouffes d'ete, Lynette plays an essential role in making sure that their work runs smoothly. When Lyney's bold nature clashes with Freminet's cautiousness, instead of taking sides, Lynette stands back and analyzes the situation in a calm and collected manner. She resolves their disputes by helping them find a middle ground.
She's generally very quiet and is in the habit of constantly observing other members of her "family." If Lyney accidentally cut his finger in the middle of a performance, or Freminet suddenly looked downcast, Lynette would make a mental note of it. When she had a suitable opportunity, she'd be there with a bandage or a cup of tea.
She loves her "family" and her "family" love her. Waking up by the fireplace, she's become accustomed to the familiar sight of Lyney at the table practicing card tricks and Freminet cleaning the living room. It was in such a moment that she suddenly realized how long it had been since the memory of those sleepless nights of fearful anticipation had vanished — just like a lump of coal that had burned itself into oblivion.
When asked who the most famous magician in the Court of Fontaine is, audiences will almost certainly think of the stylish, vibrant Lyney and his stage presence.But if you were to ask after its most renowned magic assistant, people would scratch their hands and be at quite a loss to answer.The adulation is not for her, after all, nor is the resounding applause directed at her skill and presence. As an assistant, she needs only misdirect the audience at opportune moments, ensuring the spotlight stays on the protagonist.Whether on or offstage, Lynette habitually hides behind Lyney, in shadows that neither lights nor compliments can penetrate.For an assistant, keeping a low profile is a professional matter.And as for a child of the "House"... being cloaked in shadow is how one survives.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Lynette often uses phrases like "standby" and "power-saving" to avoid unwanted trouble.Now, if one were to use a term like "idling" to avoid work, one has an 80-90% chance of getting "doesn't that mean you're free, then!?" as a reply, followed by renewed haranguing.But, say, if you were to very seriously proclaim yourself to be in "standby mode" to "save energy," and combine that with a statue-like expression like Lynette's, you can stupefy the other party for a while.It is through such momentary gaps that Lynette will calmly slip away, all the while wearing a most serious expression.This method, of course, does not work on friends, but those who know Lynette well are more than aware of her dislike of work, and still more clear with regards to the... consequences of making her do errands.Though she might spout machine-related lingo often, that is about as far as Lynette understands machines.There is a saying in her home: No matter what you do, do not leave her unattended in a room with the dishwasher, the vacuum cleaner... or any machine, really.Failing this, by the time a third party (usually Freminet) arrives on the scene, the machine will have suffered one of two fates:One, it will have broken down, somehow — the dishwasher will foam at the mouth, the vacuum cleaner will suffer convulsions, all while Lynette stands amidst the disaster zone with an innocent expression.Two, the machines are mercifully spared, but there has been no progress with the task, with Lynette cat-napping in a corner somewhere.Considering that the result of any one incident is unpredictable, and neither result is desirable, Lynette has, to her relief, been relieved of all housework.It is strange, however, that she is able to wreck even the simplest machines due to mishandling...Yet, when onstage operating magical props, Lynette is even more focused than her brother, never having made a single mistake over the years.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
From a certain point of view, a "magician's assistant" is a contradictory sort of work.The cheers and applause are for the magician, the protagonist, and similarly, the flowers and fame are not directed at the protagonist's sidekick.Yet a brilliant performance cannot exist without an assistant's cooperation.As the one closest to the magician onstage, the assistant knows all the magician's secrets, and in dangerous performances, the assistant's every move means life or death for the magician.Onstage, the magician and assistant are like a double-sided mirror. One tends toward the light, absorbing the audience's attention. The other faces the darkness, pulling levers and strings in the rear to complete the trick — each side turns the other in endless permutations.If they are to operate in harmony, the assistant's skills cannot be far behind those of the magician themselves.But with such skill, how could one long be content to live in another's shadow? Thus do many assistants, once their skills are fully developed, strike out on their own — they will not forever remain the pupil.When Lyney became famous, many notables took notice of Lynette's potential, believing that she could achieve greater stardom still should she become an independent act. Some even asked her to take up the role of a leading actress in their films.Cat ears on young lady, who was also a magician... Even with those gimmicks alone, there was a fortune to be made!Alas, these passionate entreaties fell on deaf ears, and not only would Lynette reject them... She could not even be bothered to come up with reasons for doing so, instead leaving the task of coming up with them to Lyney instead.This was quite the conundrum indeed, for many of those making requests were distinguished members of society. "Father" had left clear instructions — they were not to be treated with contempt.And if his authorship were to be discovered, any further meetings with them might turn awkward.So Lyney had no choice but to write letter after letter of refusal in Lynette's manner of speech, filling each to the margins with polite and earnest words.Even one as silver-tongued as Lyney found it exceeding difficult to mimic her laconic manner of speech.Exhausted in hand and spirit, glancing at his sister lounging on the sofa, Lyney could not help but think — why not try it for real? He could play the assistant, no problem."...Don't even think about it." Even that flicker of thought could not escape Lynette. She stretched, before flipping over to face him. "I like being your assistant."Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Brewing tea is one of Lynette's few hobbies.Watching the steam swirl above the tea cup, getting a whiff of its elegant flavor, and the day's troubles all but melt away.Whenever a guest comes to visit, Lyney is usually the one who receives them, while Lynette waits with tea in the back. When words are had over tea at home, she is also usually the one who makes it while others do the talking.As others discuss all manner of things or engage in light and idle talk, Lynette can be found sitting at the side, holding her cup in two hands, blowing on it to cool it before drinking in small sips.Her tongue is naturally sensitive, and she cannot drink tea that is too hot.But to use merely warm water to make tea would be an abominable waste, and to add ice to tea, or pour the tea between two cups to cool it down... Lynette would consider such actions blasphemy.Ice dilutes the thickness of the drink, and the pouring will affect its layered flavor... Only by blowing on it, puff by small puff of air at a time, may one achieve the ideal temperature, so as to neither scald nor be shorn of flavor.And once this ideal temperature has been achieved, one should not also drink it all immediately.Some teas have greater flavor as you near the bottom of the cup, and a wait of several minutes should be imposed after one mouthful before one may continue on and savor the next sip. That is why she always takes her time when drinking tea.By the time the teapot is empty, the conversation is usually also just about over.And as for the teaware on the table... That might be best left to someone else, lest she wreck the dishwasher again.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5  •  As Light Rain Falls Without Reason
There was once an official in Fontaine who wanted to investigate the cash flow of the Hotel Bouffes d'ete in the previous few months.However, no sooner had he finished drawing up a draft than his superior hastily called the whole business to a halt.This poor official could never have imagined how this was due to a letter his superior had received, complete with an attached set of photos featuring a tryst the latter had enjoyed with a famous socialite.This superior, too, could never have imagined that this secret had been exposed thanks to his whipping out a handkerchief that did not belong to his wife during a magic show.At that time, he had been all too absorbed in the exciting goings-on onstage, thus failing to notice the gaze directed his way from the shadows.This momentary distraction allowed Lynette to "steal" intel from him, all but picking him clean.People will unconsciously reveal themselves through their outfits, eyes, movements, and even the slight pauses and shifts in their tone...While most will be unable to get much out of such signs, buried as they are under many confusing details, Lynette is able to use her uncanny powers of observation to catch all such critical details.And after she connects all these seemingly trivial details, she can tease out intel useful to the Hotel.These "eyes" of the Hotel, one in the light and the other in darkness, have stolen all manner of secrets from the famous in Fontaine. Nor have any of these people noticed the theft — to them, it may as well have been magic.And because she must maintain this razor focus while working, Lynette speaks little to conserve her energy and not divide her attention.Even in her daily life, or when she is at rest, she habitually filters out all kinds of useless information...That said, what information counts as useful and what counts as useless is completely up to her.For example, what about machine operating and housework-related skills? Why, if one never does them, one can safely and confidently tuck them away in the back of one's mind.And when caught up in teatime gossip, one merely needs to occasionally append the conversation with "I see," "Is that so," and "And then..." to ensure a smooth-running chat.Economy of energy — just the way she prefers it.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6  •  As Light Rain Falls Without Reason
People often believe that Lynette's cat ears are a part of her performance attire, as the same blood flows in her and Lyney's veins, yet he appears no different from ordinary people.However, Lynette's ears and tail do, in fact, grow on her body — they are real as real can be.It is said that these cat-like features are inherited, but that even as such a bloodline grows thin across generations, instances of "atavism" can still occur from time to time.When she was young, Lynette did not love this particular gift from her ancestors.There would always be some curious kid who would, whether intentionally or inadvertently, point at them and ask her: Why are you different from everyone else? Are you and Lyney not real siblings?The introverted Lynette did not know how to reply, nor could Lyney always be with her. Whenever such things would happen, she could only push her ears down, curl her tail up, and squat in a corner, by herself and beside herself with misery.Only alley cats would come to comfort her, coiling around and rubbing against her ankles.She could not let her brother see her like this, she knew. He already had a great many things to worry about — he did not need this kind of trivial matter on his mind as well.But she could not simply pretend that nothing was wrong — to deceive the genius magician, she had to fool herself first.So she hugged the cat tightly to herself, softly brushing the fur on its back. As she felt its light breath, calm slowly returned to her heart.By the time the cat leapt from her arms, her face had regained its usual placid appearance.Among Fontaine's nobility, there are also some novelty-seeking degenerates. During one party, a certain "important person" found themselves taken with Lynette's unusual appearance.Over her protests, despite her struggling, the siblings' foster father stuffed her into that person's carriage without a second thought, almost as if giving away a sofa-scratching cat.Why her? Why was she born with these ears?In her suffocating solitude, Lynette once again covered her ears in pain, unable to hold back the bitterness repressed over long years."Stop hiding. Cowering will get you nowhere." That voice shone through the darkness with the moonlight. "Come out. The one who wished to harm you is dead."That voice was cruel ice, and yet it had a spellbinding, comforting power also. Lynette lifted her eyes, and there she saw the person she would in later days call "Father.""You have good ears. Learn to use them.""Father" kneaded Lynette's ears. That touch was not gentle. Indeed, they were as cold as the moon's light.And like that light, it illuminated a corner of the darkness...."When a cat's ears are folded backward, that often indicates fear or vigilance, and if they stand up and point forward, that usually indicates a good mood..."Whenever Lyney tells new members of Hotel Bouffes d'ete about the habits of ordinary cats, he will often steal a glance at his younger sister nearby.Lynette's ears are straight, they face the front, and they occasionally flutter outward.It has been a long time since she last folded them back.Non-Automated Feeding Machine Friendship Lv. 4
This is a made-to-order automated feeding machine that Freminet helped construct, intended to deal with the ever-increasing number of small animals at home.After a certain performance ended, Lynette discovered an abandoned box at the theater's back door.As she opened it, a few kittens, barely a month old, raised their heads in alarm. Yet they had not the strength to flee, and thus could only stare into her eyes anxiously.Lynette said nothing, nor did she reach out to further startle them. Instead, she simply looked back at them in silence.Slowly they seemed to come to the understanding that she meant them no harm, and eventually dipped their straining necks.Only then did Lynette pick the box of cats up, and they laid down in silence, allowing this young lady to take them back to their new "home."There was some small debate amongst family members as to whether the animals should be taken in, but the usually reticent Lynette put her foot down, insisting that they stay.The argument somehow managed to reach the ears of none other than "Father," and she had the final word — which was that her children should cease the silly squabbling."Those who wish to raise them, do so yourselves — but do it well. Don't make trouble for others."After a short silence, she then added, "And if you have not taught them how to follow the rules by the end of winter, get rid of them yourselves."That statement put paid to the rest of the argument. As for the task of teaching the cats, it fell to Lynette.Considering that Lynette was usually averse to busywork, Freminet had the automated feeding machine custom made.The machine came with an internal clock and a weighing machine that could allow it to feed the kittens various foods at precise times and in fixed amounts.This machine, in turn, became one of the few machines to survive Lynette's tender mercies, never breaking down across many years of service. Indeed, its inner components have remained spanking new, with only the plate beneath the food outlet showing much sign of use.And this... is because Lynette has never used it properly.The sort of food to add into each box, how to input feeding times and amounts... Rather than memorize that, she found it more convenient to personally prepare the cat food in a plate.Moreover, if she had to leave even feeding to a machine...Lynette squatted next to the Non-Automated Feeding Machine, stroking the satisfied cats' fur in silent thought....How would she be able to teach these children?Vision Friendship Lv. 6  •  As Light Rain Falls Without Reason
When Lynette was young, she often heard stories about Visions from Lyney.The protagonists of these tales seemed omnipotent, capable of summoning storms with a flick of a finger, dispelling dark haze with a puff of air.Those were not meticulously prepared magic tricks, no — this was the realm of true miracles.If only we had Visions too, Lynette often though.Then they could turn magic tricks into real magic. They could pull food to fill their stomachs from hats, and fire to keep themselves warm. Lyney wouldn't have to constantly busy himself keeping them both alive.But the gods never answered her prayers. In later days, she and Lyney would wander on, and after several twists and turns on the city streets and in noble mansions, they found a place to plant their feet under the aegis of their "Father."Both of them knew how hard this chance was to come by, and so they endured the harsh training and supported each other through countless missions.Reality had eroded their childish innocence all too early, and the dream of possessing a Vision, too, had fallen by the wayside of the past.During a certain mission, they were dispatched to perform at a noble's mountain villa in order to steal incriminating evidence that their target had hidden in a study.The mission itself was ordinary, and it went quite well. During their performance, the two would tamper with a window in the villa. Once it was over, they would be able to re-enter stealthily and make off with the evidence without a trace.But just as they had succeeded, three flares went up in the forest outside the window — a message from their "family members" keeping watch.Three flares meant the worst-case scenario: that the Maison Gardiennage was also targeting this person, and indeed had already dispatched forces to the scene.If they retreated the way they came, they had a high chance of encountering Maison personnel, and if they were exposed as having conducted their mission in their guise as magicians, not only would they be doomed, but their "family members" would be implicated as well.The voices outside the study were growing louder — if they wished to escape as quickly and stealthily as possible, they would have to take a risk.The villa retreat was built against the mountain, and out the window was a cliff, beneath which was a swift river.Lynette exchanged a glance with her brother, and without a word, they grasped each others' hands tightly, and leapt out the window.The rippling waves below slammed into Lyney with a terrible crash.He had attempted to absorb the impact with his shoulder just as they impacted, protecting his sister once again, but the impact with the water swallowed his consciousness.Desperate, Lynette grabbed onto a floating piece of wood, and by sheer dint of will managed to drag her unconscious brother to shore, coughing up water as she struggled on.Fighting the searing pain in her lungs, she checked his condition in a panic. He was deathly pale, his eyes squeezed shut — there was none of his usual vitality to be seen.She hugged him tightly to prevent his temperature from dropping further, even as she surveyed her surroundings. The forest was dark, and in that lightless night the twisted trees seemed ever more malevolent.She called his name softly, hoping that he might stand up again with a grin, just as he had in their prior performances. But this time, the only reply she received was his fragile and weak breathing.The loneliness and fear of that fateful night so many years ago seized her heart once again.It had been so long, and they'd been through so much — she'd grown from that, or so she thought.Why, then, were things just like before? Could she do nothing but wait for someone to defend her? As she trembled in the darkness?No. No. It should have been different. They had made so many miracles by their own hand, conquered so many obstacles....She had wished to stand behind him, supporting him, back to back, shoulder to shoulder.The Maison personnel could be patrolling nearby. She dared not call out to their "family members," nor could they stay here.The only thing she could do now was grasp Lyney's hand tightly, and haul him onto her shoulders.If she could not see the way forward, then she would hear it.Extending her ears as high as she could, she listened out for even the slightest wisp of wind.And the wind sang through the branches and through the bushes, and brushed against her face... and they gradually painted for her a blurry scene.Lynette groped forward in the dark, the thorns along the path piercing her skin and staining her clothes red.Slowly, the sight before her eyes became clearer. Perhaps her ears had grown used to the wind, or her eyes, accustomed to the darkness, but her steps grew more agile, more resolute.In this stage without spotlights, in this performance without plaudits, Lynette had at last become the star.As the rays of dawn darted into the woods, Lynette carried her brother back to the rendezvous point of their "family," only to encounter someone unexpected — their "Father" had personally made the trip down last night.Using the last of her strength, Lynette retrieved the sodden evidence from her bosom, but before she could hand it over, her legs gave out, taking Lyney down with her in the fall."Father" grabbed them both, allowing the incriminating information to fall to the earth and be soiled."Sleep now. You've retrieved... a far more valuable prize."A Vision, reflecting both the dawn sun and the twins' sleeping faces, hung at Lynette's waist, glowing silently.
Obtain:Reward for reaching Friendship Level 10 with LynetteDescription:One major type of magic revolves around "appearing suddenly." Lynette is usually conserving her energy, but her serious side can "appear" as abruptly as pigeons from a hat.

There's no hardship we can't overcome as long as we're together, and similarly, we share all our joys with each other. There's nothing in the world I treasure more than my family, so I know what it must be like for you...

But those experiences have also made us who we are today. We're doing alright these days. I have a hat full of hopes and dreams... Heh, and a family, and audience, hoping that I don't let them down!Least Favorite Food Media:VO_Lyney Least Favorite Food.ogg Media:VO ZH_Lyney Least Favorite Food.ogg Media:VO JA_Lyney Least Favorite Food.ogg Media:VO KO_Lyney Least Favorite Food.ogg Our performances require that Lynette and I have matching physiques, so we have to avoid eating any oily food.

He's so mature for his age, it catches me off guard sometimes... Oh, and how could I forget — it was so kind of him to try and cheer up the children in Poisson with an impromptu free magic show during the flood! I'll have to invite him and Lynette over for some macarons at my place when I get the chance. I know Lynette's always conjuring teacups out of thin air, so surely at least she's a fan of a proper tea break?NeuvilletteAbout Lyney and Lynette Media:VO_Neuvillette About Lyney and Lynette.ogg Media:VO ZH_Neuvillette About Lyney and Lynette.ogg Media:VO JA_Neuvillette About Lyney and Lynette.ogg Media:VO KO_Neuvillette About Lyney and Lynette.ogg Their performances are just fascinating, don't you think?

After observing her a little bit, I noticed that her ears lean forward when she's having tea and cake. Hee-hee, I just wanna stroke her on the head... You too? Why don't we ask her for permission next time?MailsSenderMailsFreminetSharing... (Birthday Mail)LyneyA Birthday Surprise! (Birthday Mail)
She is the middle sibling in the trio, being Lyney's younger twin and Freminet's adoptive older sister.
The light source and shading of Lynette's Wish Art differs from that of her Card.
Additionally, her Wish Art on her HoYoWiki entry has blue-gray eyes similar to Lyney's, whereas all her other depictions — including her in-game Wish Art — give her purple eyes.
The star-shaped mark on her face may be a mouche, an artificial beauty mark that was fashionable in sixteenth-century France (and later, across Europe).
The English name Lynette (among various spellings) is derived from the French Lunete, which itself comes from the Welsh Eluned, meaning "image" or "idol."

About Lynette: MagicAbout Lynette: MagicMedia:VO_Lynette About Lynette - Magic.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Lynette_About_Lynette_-_Magic.ogg During our shows, I'm usually Lyney's assistant. Because I never speak or change expressions, people often mistake me for a puppet... this kind of misunderstanding can prevent unnecessary social interactions, so it's actually quite nice.

Once, a VIP audience member at our show took out a handkerchief that didn't belong to his wife... as for how such information is used, now... that depends on what Father wants.
About Us: Listening Friendship Lv. 4About Us: Listening Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Lynette About Us - Listening.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Lynette_About_Us_-_Listening.ogg I'm not accustomed to expressing myself, but I consider myself a good listener.

About Us: Interests Friendship Lv. 6About Us: Interests Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Lynette About Us - Interests.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Lynette_About_Us_-_Interests.ogg I used to think that the golden sun and dark shadows of the night could never understand one another. But in you, I see a kind of strange complexity that has needlessly piqued my curiosity... I'll have to keep a close eye on you.
About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Lynette About the Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Lynette_About_the_Vision.ogg I prefer to use my eyes to understand the situation and find an appropriate solution, as opposed to using martial prowess. But having brute force as an option greatly increases the potential cards at your disposal, and enables you to protect those most important to you in a crisis.
Something to ShareSomething to ShareMedia:VO_Lynette Something to Share.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Lynette_Something_to_Share.ogg Making tea looks simple on the surface, but it is actually quite complex. The quality of the tea leaves, the temperature of the water, the number of times to add water... Only when every variable is properly controlled can tea of the purest taste be brewed. Would you like a cup?
Interesting ThingsInteresting ThingsMedia:VO_Lynette Interesting Things.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Lynette_Interesting_Things.ogg Animals can also express their feelings. If you listen carefully, you can tell what state they are in. For a kitty, "Meow~" means they are much happier than "Meow meow meow!", and in that situation, you can pet them as much as you want and they won't run away.

Thus, he tends to be more quiet than normal when we are alone. Hmm? Can I tell when he's lying or telling the truth? Of course I can, but this matter is top secret.
About Lyney: Worries Friendship Lv. 6About Lyney: Worries Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Lynette About Lyney - Worries.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Lynette_About_Lyney_-_Worries.ogg Lyney is normally quite confident, and does everything with incredible ease... or at least, that's how he wants everyone else to see him. So when he runs into difficulties, he always wants to solve everything perfectly on his own... if this happens, please be sure to take good care of him.
About Freminet Friendship Lv. 4About Freminet Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Lynette About Freminet.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Lynette_About_Freminet.ogg He is a delicate and gentle child, but also tends to belittle himself... perhaps due to his previous experiences. Sometimes he feels like the antithesis of Lyney... but since they're both family, when their opinions clash, I will bridge their differences.

After all, when he speaks with Melusines, he's actually quite friendly.
About Furina Friendship Lv. 4About Furina Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Lynette About Furina.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Lynette_About_Furina.ogg Lady Furina's behavior is incredibly hard to explain, and I can't discern any useful intelligence from observing her. I always feel like her every move and action is an act, and she is playing different people... She truly is an Archon, one cannot apply the logic of ordinary humans to her.

If we really had a sister like her in the "House of the Hearth," that would be really great... I know I probably shouldn't be wishing for anyone to be an orphan, but...

Even just as a bystander, the coldness radiating from her was absolutely chilling... I don't know what it would be like to face her directly in a duel, and I hope I will never find out.
About Chiori Friendship Lv. 4About Chiori Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Lynette About Chiori.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Lynette_About_Chiori.ogg The costumes Lyney and I wear for performances were specially tailored by Chiori. Once, Lyney was using a small knife for a magic trick, and accidentally cut the cuff of his sleeve a bit. She scolded us nonstop... it was scary. Luckily, I can hide behind Lyney whenever we go to her shop.
About Charlotte Friendship Lv. 4 As Light Rain Falls Without ReasonAbout Charlotte Friendship Lv. 4 As Light Rain Falls Without ReasonMedia:VO_Lynette About Charlotte.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Lynette_About_Charlotte.ogg Uh... I was eventually cornered by her for interviews a few times. The way she persistently asked even after Lyney rejected her all those times, I really have to commend her perseverance. Too bad for her, though... despite preparing all those questions, I never answered a single one.
About Emilie Friendship Lv. 4About Emilie Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Lynette About Emilie.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Lynette_About_Emilie.ogg Her perfume products are so popular that you have to get in line before the break of dawn to have a chance at snapping any up. However, I'm far too sensitive to the smell of perfume, and it's really rude to sneeze... so I have to take the long way around.
More About Lynette: IMore About Lynette: IMedia:VO_Lynette More About Lynette - 01.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Lynette_More_About_Lynette_-_01.ogg If you explain a magic trick, then the allure of the performance is lost. Personal relationships are the same. If you want to understand me, why not learn a bit at a time, and gradually piece together a complete picture?

Even when they are not doing so intentionally, they will still unconsciously hide their true selves. Though I can always notice a few "redundant" details, I won't expose their facades when it isn't necessary.

In the name of magic performances, we can easily gain more access throughout the city, and be the "eyes" of our House.

We experienced many hardships and dangerous situations... It was then that I developed the habit of paying attention to any sign of danger, and also gradually learned to understand what others were thinking. Fortunately, we now have a safe place to live.

No matter how much information you have, it's hard to predict how other people might change. I've always had the habit of keeping a safe distance from others, but in your case... I'm willing to shoulder the risk of losing a bet.
Lynette's HobbiesLynette's HobbiesMedia:VO_Lynette Hobbies.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Lynette_Hobbies.ogg A person's mental state is like a bowstring. If it's constantly under high tension, it will be at risk of suddenly snapping. So outside of work, I prefer to do things that relax my brain, like making tea, feeding cats, and just zoning out. The calmer one normally is, the easier it is to deal with crises when they do pop up.
Lynette's TroublesLynette's TroublesMedia:VO_Lynette Troubles.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Lynette_Troubles.ogg I tend to have difficulties operating any kind of machinery. As soon as I stop paying attention, all kinds of things start to go wrong. Once, I even broke the dryer on a rainy day... At least Freminet is good at fixing things.

Lynette can be invited as a Companion into the player's Serenitea Pot after obtaining her and completing the World Quest Idle Teapot Talk.
If a character's favorite furnishing set is placed in the same realm as the character for the first time, the character will automatically teleport to the furnishing set. Interacting with the character will initiate a special dialogue, after which the character will teleport back to their original position.

Media:vo lynette mimitomo hello 01.ogg Lynette: ...
Media:vo lynette mimitomo hello 02.ogg Lynette: ...Exiting standby mode. Sorry, I am not trying to ignore you. It just takes some time to get my systems back up and running.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Lynette: As long as you let your consciousness freely drift, it doesn't matter where you are.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Lynette: ...Though, according to normal standards, the environment here is quite pleasant indeed.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship1 03a 1.ogg Lynette: Pure, clear air, a soft, warm bed, a lot of open space...
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship1 03a 2.ogg Lynette: Had we grown up in an environment like this, Lyney probably wouldn't have been nearly so anxious.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship1 03a 3.ogg Lynette: ...I seem to have allowed some subjective thoughts to color my review. Please pay it no heed. Objectively speaking, this is a delightful place.
 And according to your standards?
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship1 03b 1.ogg Lynette: It is well-suited to spacing out. My charging speed is currently 5% faster than usual.
 What an... interesting metric...
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship1 03b 2.ogg Lynette: ...By my standards, that is the highest praise that can be given.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Lynette: ...
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Lynette: ...Now that's rare. People wanting me to start a conversation is a rather infrequent occurrence.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Lynette: After all, in most cases, this would just mean falling into an uncomfortable silence like this.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship2 04a 1.ogg Lynette: No, that's not it. You can often find me talking with other girls.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship2 04a 2.ogg Lynette: They often gossip about the latest issues of serialized novels, or the gossip on who has a crush on whom...
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship2 04a 3.ogg Lynette: Just say "Oh, I see", "Wow, really?", or "Go on!" at the right moment... and the conversation will flow freely.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship2 04a 4.ogg Lynette: ...It's a great way to conserve your energy. I highly recommend it.
 Well, if you don't talk, then silence is inevitable...
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship2 04b 1.ogg Lynette: Saying something requires first listening, then analyzing, constructing your idea, and finally speaking out loud.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship2 04b 2.ogg Lynette: A back-and-forth conversation would require me to go through all the steps very efficiently. Mm... I've always found it quite taxing.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship2 04b 3.ogg Lynette: ...Also, is it not true some people prefer to chat with someone who listens more than they talk?
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship2 04b 4.ogg Lynette: If you ever have something to vent about, feel free to come and confide in me. I have a lot of experience in comforting others and calming things down.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship2 04b 5.ogg Lynette: Also, you can rest assured that your secrets will always be safe with me.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Lynette: ...
 ...Other than zoning out, I mean?
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Lynette: ...If that isn't an option, then I can't really think of anything else to do.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Lynette: Would you like a cup of tea? I can go make one for you.
 You're the guest. Shouldn't I be the one making tea for you?
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Lynette: It's no trouble. For me, making tea is a truly enjoyable activity.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Lynette: I make tea for everyone whenever Lyney receives a guest.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Lynette: Selecting the best tea leaves, testing the water temperature, and observing the steam as it rises from the water's surface... I very much enjoy the whole process. Only with absolute concentration can you brew the perfect cup of tea.
 Who would've thought the process is so complicated...
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Lynette: ...Also, no one will drag me into a conversation when I'm busy making tea.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Lynette: And once the tea is ready, as long as you sit there holding the cup and maintain the appearance of sipping your tea in peace, nobody will try to talk to you.
 So the point is still to zone out, then.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Lynette: Hehe, I was kidding. Was that surprising? I can crack jokes every now and then, too. I just rarely see the need.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Lynette: But I really do enjoy brewing and drinking tea. I'm able to taste even the most subtle differences in flavor.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Lynette: Considering all the places you've visited, you must have tried many different flavors during your journey.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Lynette: You want to try one of my brews next time you're free? I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo morning 01.ogg Lynette: Good morning, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo lynette mimitomo morning 02.ogg Lynette: Mornings are good, aren't they? They are the start of a new day, which means there is plenty of time left to rest some more.
Media:vo lynette mimitomo morning 03.ogg Lynette: ...Would you like to rest with me?
Media:vo lynette mimitomo night 01.ogg Lynette: Good night, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo lynette mimitomo night 02.ogg Lynette: ...Entering standby mode. Zzz... Zzz...
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.
Court of Justice's Booming Commerce[]
Media:vo mimitomo fd lynette businessdistrict 01.ogg Lynette: This reminds me of the kind of places Lyney takes me to do street magic.
Media:vo mimitomo fd lynette businessdistrict 02.ogg Lynette: With a parasol for comfort — and without Lyney's constant chatter — I estimate my energy recharge rate will double.
Media:vo mimitomo fd lynette businessdistrict 03.ogg Lynette: I'm gonna sit here and drink some tea for a while. Wanna join me? I remember how much sugar you take in yours.
Media:vo mimitomo fd lynette stagestyle 01.ogg Lynette: You're looking in my direction, but the stage is clearly in your peripheral vision. You're hoping to see a show, aren't you...
Media:vo mimitomo fd lynette stagestyle 02.ogg Lynette: Boop-boop.
Media:vo mimitomo fd lynette stagestyle 03.ogg Lynette: Standby mode activated while Lyney completes the upstream performance process. Enjoy the show.
