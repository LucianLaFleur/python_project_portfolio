A journalist from The Steambird, Charlotte is always on the prowl for an exclusive scoop. Ever so relentless and indefatigable, she won't stop until she finds out the truth, even if she comes closer to danger.
Charlotte's outfit. "If your reporting isn't real enough, it's because you're not close enough." Charlotte often has this to say about journalism. Sometimes, however, she adds: "But of course, maybe it's that the lens you're using just isn't that great."

Your credible source of the unbelievable truth!
...Euphrasie, three days ago, one of your journalists secretly followed a suspect all the way from the Court of Fontaine to Romaritime Harbor, and almost ended up being tied up and thrown into the sea by a gang of criminals. Whether or not there's any truth in the notion that 'nearer to the action is closer to the truth,' surely Miss Charlotte doesn't value her reports more than she does her own life?—Yet another exasperated exchange between Captain Chevreuse of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol and Euphrasie, Editor-in-Chief of The Steambird
Fontaine's famous newspaper The Steambird has a veritable legion of reporters it can call upon, each with their own area of expertise. Some specialize in celebrity gossip, others follow the word on the street, while others still focus on political affairs...
But among them all, there is one that stands head and shoulders above the rest thanks to her seemingly boundless reserve of energy and perseverance — the inimitable Charlotte.
Unswervingly committed to the principle that "nearer to the action is closer to the truth," Charlotte has a habit of popping up literally anywhere and everywhere in Fontaine — from its widest avenues to its narrowest back alleys, its highest vantage points to its lowest subterranean vaults, even its tallest mountains to its deepest undersea caverns. She captures the "truth" with her Kamera, records it in her articles, and finally unveils it for all to see.
And when the "truth" comes out, she's met with a variety of different reactions ranging from applause, to embarrassment, to outright fury. There are even some who would resort to any means necessary to make a particular article connected to themselves disappear. Or alternatively, just make Charlotte disappear.
For this reason, the newspaper's Editor-in-Chief Euphrasie has on numerous occasions felt the need to distance Charlotte from the Court of Fontaine by sending her off on faraway "field reporting" jobs, only recalling her once the Maison Gardiennage or Special Security and Surveillance Patrol had finally managed to clear things up.
But despite all this, neither the toil of the job itself nor the pressure of external denunciations and threats has ever phased [sic] Charlotte in the slightest.
With her trusty companion Monsieur Verite by her side, she invariably carries out her journalistic duties with unfaltering fervor, rushing about in pursuit of all the "truths" out there just waiting to be discovered.
In the Court of Fontaine, a new "story" is born every minute.For example, Romaritime Harbor might suddenly swell with new ships, crewed by sailors of obviously non-Fontainian origin. Some fishmonger in Poisson might suddenly buy three months' worth of fish in a single month, or countless flyers boasting of a certain place where especially delicious fish can be found might suddenly appear in the Court...In the eyes of a mediocre reporter or ordinary city folk, these are "independent" tales, just like there will always be waves rippling across the sea's surface — such ordinary events are barely worth paying attention to at all.Clumsier journalists might even chase these waves, and dispiritedly end up merely following the wave's patterns, constantly pumping out "surface-level stories" of little interest.But in Charlotte's eyes, these waves are but the superficial representation of other forces. What is causing them to crest and break? That is the story she seeks.Perhaps it is the wild winds wailing over the surface, or perhaps they are due to the Thalatta Submarine Canyon's complex seabed topography. Of course, you can't rule out the possibility of tremors from the Elton Trench either...These stories are the "deep dives" Charlotte desires.A reporter should be an agile "seeker" — not a mere gauche "recorder."This, then, is Charlotte's "work doctrine."As to how she avoids being swept up in her "deep dives"... well, that's up to Euphrasie and her fellow citizens!Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Charlotte was fascinated with the world around her from a young age.The first Rainbow Rose that bloomed in the yard come spring, exceeding all others in vibrance. The children gladly padding about in puddles on the leaf-strewn streets after a storm and their hapless laughing families. The beauty of a solitary shell on the seashore, and the tiny crab surveying the world from underneath. The Blubber Profiterole she had with her family on her birthday, and the ever-so-slightly-too-deep color of the cream...To most, a flower is a flower, a shell is a shell, and a Profiterole is still a Profiterole even if it is a bit too sweet — that's just how the world is.But to Charlotte, these hidden "details" — only visible out of the corners of her eyes — are essential to understanding the world.Charlotte's father, a seasoned reporter and professional nature photographer, noticed his daughter's interest in and knack for "observation." Thus, on her tenth birthday, he gave her a custom-made Kamera, its dimensions and the positions of its buttons built specially for her."Not all people are attentive enough to seek out and observe subtle differences, but this, Charlotte, is your unique talent."Those were the words of her father, the "Reporter of the Idylls," Galanopoulo.From then on, there was a little junior reporter by the senior reporter's side. This father-daughter tag team could be found on streets wide and narrow, forests and rivers alike, raising two Kameras, one large and one small, taking countless still images of moving beauty.Even though their "interviews" always caused the gentle yet strict Mrs. Gagnepetit to nag them incessantly, Charlotte's laughter never failed to be the quickest way to make her mother stop. And as for her soiled clothes and dirtied hat, those were left to the ever-capable Mr. Galanopoulo.To her, the whole world is a giant treasure trove.And those pictures, for their part, are her special treasure maps.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
Galanopoulo always emphasized one thing to Charlotte:"A picture of sufficiently great beauty cannot be ignored."With her consent, he sent the photos they'd taken to The Steambird. The editors were quickly taken with their photos — especially Charlotte's — and profusely praised Galanopoulo's ever-improving photography skills, reserving, just as before, prime placement for them in their publication.Those pictures caused quite the stir when they were published, with critics stumbling over each other to flatter them, and newspaper hobbyists fighting to get copies to make their clipping collections yet more colorful and vivid.But when both critics or fellow journalists came calling and asked how Galanopoulo advanced his aesthetic sensibilities by leaps and bounds...The veteran reporter lightly pushed Charlotte forward, saying calmly: "Ah, such pictures are beyond me. It's all my daughter's handiwork!"The experienced, learned ladies and gentlemen who had come knocking could not but fall silent first, before expressing surprise, and then beginning to whisper amongst themselves and even venturing a few questions.Charlotte blinked. The bewildered adults before her seemed every bit like little insects searching for shelter in a storm, waving their antennae this way and that, crying "Where are the leaves? Where are the leaves?""Hey, everyone, look this way!"The young child's cry caused them to collectively leap out of their worn skins, and everyone turned to look, only to be greeted by a custom-made Kamera and the click of a shutter.In that moment, all of it was captured on film — the furrowed brows, quirked lips, red faces, tangled hair, and waving arms, perfectly encapsulating those panicked bugs in the storm.The little reporter patted her Kamera and smiled toothily."I'll call this one... 'No, No, That Won't Do!'"Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
After Charlotte's extraordinary photography skills had made her famous, she began receiving frequent visits from manuscript writers, magazine editors, news clipping collectors, and her father's reporter colleagues. Even Euphrasie, the Editor-in-Chief of The Steambird, was amongst them.Euphrasie was straightforward about her intent. She hoped that Charlotte would agree to become a "special correspondent" — someone who would conduct interviews and write articles in addition to taking photographs....However, her father, despite his usual mild temperament, was strongly against it. He did not wish for his daughter to associate with those kinds of people, either full of ulterior motives or hypocrites."Nature is fierce, but it is honest. Storms don't loose their fury without reason, nor do beasts bare their fangs without cause.""But people lie — they always do. A Kamera can only capture their faces, but the lens cannot target their hearts."He would respect Charlotte's decision, of course, but he preferred that Charlotte live a simpler, happier life, without sinking into the morass of humanity.To Charlotte, this world was a treasure trove, and pictures her treasure maps.But for the first time, she came to realize that this trove still harbored undiscovered "truths."These truths were not themselves treasures, but were more akin to a procession of dark memories. Intentionally hidden, discarded, disguised, and then abandoned, with those having done so wishing that they would never be discovered, and that all events connected to them would simply end right there.Charlotte knew that she could find them. She could dig up these truths, like digging tulip bulbs in a garden, like leading hermit crabs out of their shells, like finding pinecones hidden by squirrels....But she also felt like a bird glimpsing an onrushing flash flood, a cave rat foreseeing an earthquake, or a fish sensing a coming tsunami.With great ability comes great responsibility.One with the talent for uncovering "truth" was also responsible for bringing the "truth" to light.The only question was, did she have the courage to do so?Her parents responded with silence, for they knew that their daughter had already made her choice. Charlotte was old enough, and all birds are destined to spread their wings and leave the nest someday.The next morning, Euphrasie went to work as usual, and there, waiting for her at the entrance to The Steambird, she saw Charlotte, ready with her Kamera and notepad."Welcome to The Steambird, Charlotte."Euphrasie extended a hand."I believe the next La Verite Prize is yours to win."Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
The La Verite Prize, established and funded by The Steambird, is the most prestigious prize a Fontainian reporter can win.Only the best of the best have ever won it: Hirailles and her tireless reporting on the investigative work of the Maison Gardiennage, the solitary Hobereau and his marine life photography honed over decades living by the sea, and of course, Dieuleveux, famed for his unbending, straight-talking nature, to the point where all threats and criticism simply bounced off his hide, never causing his quill to waver in the slightest.And of course, the renowned genius reporter, Charlotte, has long since joined their storied number. In fact, her reporting stands out so far above the rest that she has won the prize several times in a row.Critics have lavished her with praise, lauding her "unequaled sense of composition," "incomparably fresh angles," "unquestionable impartiality," and "unparalleled flair"...Detractors, on the other hand, believe that her successive triumphs are the result of collusion between The Steambird and the prize selection committee. How could such a young and unorthodox reporter be showered with glory, if not so the newspaper employing her could also bask in that glow? And why else would she be so close to the committee members, anyway?Even so, her talents are beyond doubt. As another round of selection for the La Verite prize drew near, all her colleagues believed that she was guaranteed to emerge victorious once again.They'd seen how she infiltrated the haunts of criminal rings alone and secretly visited illegal sweatshops... For report after report, Charlotte had braved unspeakable dangers and endured unimaginable hardships to bring the truth to readers... Whether it be in her professional dedication to the profession, her masterful manuscripts, or her attitude toward reporting, Charlotte was worthy of the committee's favor.The question on everyone's minds, really — especially those of the sponsors — was "Which one of her reports will she submit to the committee?"It would, after all, be her ticket to the La Verite Prize, and that would make it a collectors' item of... considerable value, surely.But to everyone's astonishment, Charlotte unexpectedly declared that her submission would be a brand-new, never-before-published report, one that would reveal some heretofore unrivaled "truth."Dear readers, to find out, please subscribe to The Steambird and look out for tomorrow's headline!Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
"Prestige Prize Proved Perniciously Partial — The Real La Verite."This was the headline on the day the award was to be announced.In it, Charlotte detailed the various monetary dealings that the long-serving members of the La Verite Award selection committee had engaged in over the previous decade, various inequities in their judgments, and provided an exhaustive list of reporters and reports who had been done dirty in the process.Her report caused an uproar in the Court of Fontaine, with countless reporters surging to the committee offices — Charlotte, of course, among them.Amidst a broadside of shutter clicks, Charlotte unleashed a barrage of meticulously-prepared questions from a thick notebook at the dumbstruck committee members, one after another. Red and shame-faced, the gentlemen flapped their clumsy lips as best they could, only to produce explications akin to porous cheese. In the end, they had to declare the questions out of order and in violation of normal procedure, before fleeing right before the gathered reporters' eyes.Charlotte's "report" had barely begun, though.She continued publishing articles concerning the La Verite Award in The Steambird, even directing her pen against certain figures in the newspaper itself who had been connected to the La Verite selection committee, laying out the manner in which they had recommended reporters with whom they shared beneficial arrangements for awards, and how those reporters had returned the favors...Charlotte's articles swept through the Fontainian media world like a tidal wave, and in response to public outcry, the Maison Gardiennage declared an official inquiry into the Award, suspending its activities and investigating all suspicious awardees.Charlotte, for her part, temporarily lived inside The Steambird's offices, with all prospective visitors "wanting a word with her" being turned away by Euphrasie with extreme prejudice. It reached the point where the Maison Gardiennage even dispatched a guard detail to the newspaper's office entrance.With her own hand Charlotte had lifted a huge stone that none had wanted to peek under, and the creepy crawlies that had lurked in its cracks and crevices now had to face the searing sunlight of the "truth."The Maison Gardiennage's investigation concluded three months later. Judges who had given unjust judgment, contestants who had contended to win glory undeserved, and editors who sought to edify themselves all received their just deserts.The La Verite Award selection committee was also wholly reorganized, now under various forms of new oversight. Once this was complete, the first thing they did was to give Charlotte the now utterly discredited award.Of course, the trophy was but dead dross to her.The real honor she had received was that the "truth" she had revealed in her report — and the ones that followed in its wake, of course — now shone in the sun."Monsieur Verite" Friendship Lv. 4
A gift to Charlotte from her father that she carries with her to this day.Though he still didn't wish for her to take on such complicated work, her father respected her decision to formally accept the job of being a special correspondent for The Steambird.He commissioned a friend skilled with machinery and modifying Kameras, and made extensive modifications to that small Kamera.For example: Making it easier to switch out the film canisters such that Charlotte could swap film with only one hand, or making the photographic compartment water, fire, impact, and explosion-proof, to the point that the Kamera's exterior casing could be utterly destroyed, yet the compartment containing the film would remain intact and unharmed...Her father insisted on numerous modifications to which his friend initially opined, "This isn't necessary, is it...?" with a bitter smile. Nevertheless, in the end they agreed to make the modifications, including a high-powered loudspeaker that, when activated, unleashed an ear-splitting alarm, as well as a hidden self-defense system on the Kamera's side that ejected a concealed knife outward at high speed when the right button was pressed...They also included "a shutter delay device," a "lens self-coupling setup," and more...All the concerns and worries of her father were installed into the device along with all manner of contraptions, transforming it into an ever-reliable, unequaled super Kamera that reflected its owner perfectly.And when the modifications were finished, Charlotte gave it a new name — "Verite."Meaning, of course, "truth."Vision Friendship Lv. 6
Charlotte does not, in fact, really know just when she obtained her Vision.Previously, she had been penning a new piece about problems in how salvage divers were treated, and had gone to interview Dollander, who employed a great number of said divers. The chubby-faced man did not seem keen on speaking the truth, and indeed was only interested in answering any questions insofar as he might redirect them. The divers he employed, too, proved quite tight-lipped.Despite the serious damage that had been done to their lungs and eardrums, the long work hours exhausting them utterly, the decrepit divesuits they used, and the inedible food, they held their silence in front of Dollander. Their smug boss smiled triumphantly at her lack of progress.By the next day, Charlotte had procured a divesuit through personal connections and was ready to get close to the divers in secret as they worked, and use her Kamera to capture Dollander's ill-treatment of them firsthand. They were in a titanic undersea rift, a place where it was completely forbidden to work according to Fontainian diving regulations.After that, Charlotte did not appear at work for a good long while. All the other Steambird reporters saw was a stream of Maison Gardiennage officers coming in and out of the office, with Euphrasie uncharacteristically ruffled, working late into the night every day.Some reporters said that they saw someone dressed in outmoded clothes, drenched and shivering as they squatted at the office entrance.Some said that an undersea earthquake had occurred in the Thalatta Submarine Canyon, where divers employed by some fellow named Dollander had been working, and that they had avoided injury by the skin of their teeth.Some other reporters even said that this Dollander had secretly put out a bounty for a Kamera that was said to contain pictures important to him.Still, Charlotte did not emerge.But reporters are most certainly not a passive lot. The Steambird's reporters began to act quietly and surreptitiously. Some utilized their personal connections to look into Dollander's business, while others followed the divers, and others still wrote pieces implicating Dollander...With The Steambird working at full steam, it was fearsomely quick indeed, and before long an extensive report on Dollander's illicit employment practices was complete.However, without any photographic evidence to corroborate the article, the reporters felt it was...Just then, the doors to the main entrance were suddenly flung wide open, and in strode Charlotte, clad in rags and sans spectacles and shoes. Placing Monsieur Verite on the table, she grinned."I have the pictures right here!"No questions were asked about what she'd been through. Instead, all worked as one, focusing on slotting each image into the report.The next day, The Steambird headline was this — "Dollander: Undersea Scrooge," detailing his illegal employment practices, salary deductions, the harm done to the health of his employees, and other vile conduct. As for the article's author, it was listed as "The Steambird Reporters."The night before that edition was to be published, Charlotte was, as always, in the printing room doing some final proofreading work.When she finished reading the final word and put the manuscript down, she suddenly noticed that an icy-blue Vision had appeared beside her hand.Scrutinizing it, all she could manage was to mumble a few words:"I think we'll have to leave out this little detail..."

You'll be right up there on the front cover, there'll be a whole feature about you that I wrote myself, and— Huh? What do you mean, "no need"? C'mon, I've been pushing Euphrasie for ages on this! Can't you reconsider? I'll make it up to you, I promise! I'll treat you to a huge meal, pleeease?
About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Charlotte About the Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Charlotte_About_the_Vision.ogg To be honest... I'd prefer to have an Anemo Vision. Being able to fly around freely would make getting to interviews sooo much easier! A Cryo Vision's not too bad, though. At least I don't need to worry about my Kamera overheating.

That's my journalistic motto. Hmm? ...Haha, yep, exactly — "credible" and "incredible" at the same time! What's that? ...Oh, if I had to choose, then obviously being credible is much more important! But most readers would sooner pay money for sensational stories than mundane facts... So we have to focus on the most incredible true stories to keep our readers engaged.

I've got loads of other outfits for him too, all in different styles. He comes dressed to impress for every interview, whatever the occasion!

I don't know why, but somehow, she's found herself at the epicenter of all sorts of bad news lately... Luckily for her, I've been snatching up all the articles that mention her and doing whatever damage control I can before they get published. Heh, and uh... then getting told off constantly by Euphrasie for interfering... But y'know, I think Navia deserves a break, so I'm happy to take one for the team. Also, she agreed to do an in-depth exclusive interview, which definitely sweetens the deal!

Do you know how many times that is now? ...Uh, actually, I've lost count. But never mind! Evading me only further confirms my suspicion that he's hiding the news story of a lifetime! As long as I keep digging, I'll find it — and when I do, it will shake the world like no other news report in history!

It's like she's some sort of... clockwork doll. I'm really tempted to write an article titled something like: "The Genius Magician's Puppet Assistant: Magic's Best-Kept Secret"... but I have a sneaking suspicion that even that wouldn't get a reaction out of her.

I have a source who tells me that she uses some sort of mystical ritual to keep her weapon as good as new... Could this be the secret behind her famously undefeated track record in the Duelists' Ring? Ah, I'd love to spring that question on her one day... but I don't think I'll get the chance. She's publicly stated that she doesn't accept interviews.

Did you get to meet the Duke in person? Yeah? Any nuggets of information that I should know about? Never mind the Credit Coupons, the Coupon Cafeteria, "If a man will not work, he shall not eat"... That's all just generic filler. I'm talking about personal anecdotes about the man of Meropide himself... What do you mean, "confidentiality"? Aw, not you, too! We had a deal! That does it — remember that gigantic feast I treated you to? I want my money back! Get your butts back to prison and do your time, you swindlers, you!

She introduced me to this amazing one the other day that works as an insect repellent, anti-perspirant, and deodorant all in one! It's a total life-saver for someone like me who spends so much time zooming around all over the place. I actually sprayed some on my wrist today... Go on, take a whiff, it's heavenly!

Aside from the wealthy housewives of Fontaine and the box-ticking tourists from overseas, some of the regular customers there look like really rough characters! Big muscly types with scars on their face, guys in masks and hats with their swords drawn... But they always come bearing gifts and acting like humble servants. Uh... Well, mostly. Anyone with a bad attitude is literally sent flying back out the door. Seriously! I snapped a photo of a guy being thrown out once, he was like four feet in the air!

He quickly took an interest in Monsieur Verite — that's my Kamera-slash-assistant — and even made a few improvements to my lenses. I gotta say, though, my heart was in my mouth watching him completely dismantle Monsieur Verite in a matter of seconds... Amazing he managed to reassemble it just as swiftly. He seems very experienced — I was convinced he must have graduated from the Fontaine Research Institute, but he denied it.

It's their way of making sure the interview goes off without a hitch. It's such a rigmarole. I'm losing the will to live just talking about it.
About Furina Friendship Lv. 4About Furina Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Charlotte About Furina.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Charlotte_About_Furina.ogg Lady Furina has a very captivating presence. She was born to be a star. Euphrasie once assigned a journalist to shadow her, but he quit not long into the assignment... From what I've heard, the reason he left was that Furina insisted on seeing every photo he took of her right away, and she'd make him redo it if she wasn't happy with how it turned out. Apparently, she was so picky that the poor guy once had to take 127 shots of her in the same pose before she was content...

As well as The Steambird, I also looked at some other independent publications out there, which tend to be more specialized. For example, there's "The Observer" for celebrity gossip, "Leisure Weekly," which focuses on competitive sport and other entertainment news, "Top Chef" for those who like to read... all the food critiques in one place, and "Bedazzled!" which is just sort of a glorified rumor and speculation mill. I learned a whole lot from reading all those papers. Or... Well, I at least learned how to master a bunch of different writing styles.

I disguised myself as a vagrant, infiltrated the back kitchen, took a job as a kitchen hand, and stuck around until I'd gathered enough solid evidence about their misdeeds. Then, I put it all in an article and had it published in the paper. The backlash was intense. They were punished for their crimes, sure, but that didn't stop them from launching a vicious campaign of vengeance against me almost immediately. I was coming home to threat letters sitting on my bedside table on a daily basis, and we'd also find mud slung on the front door to our office... The Steambird quickly filed a report to the Gardes, and I was sent to Mondstadt to report on Genius Invokation TCG.[Note 1] It took a while before I could safely return to Fontaine. These kind of things happen all the time. I honestly don't know Euphrasie deals with it...

Even as a kid, long before I ever thought about going into journalism, I was always convinced that secrets and mysteries were lurking in every corner... To me, the world is a giant hoard of hidden treasure, with countless stories waiting to be uncovered. Every time I see something where I think a secret might be hiding, I snap a photo with my Kamera and add it to my collection. These photos are like my own personal treasure map... and I'm constantly going back to them, trying new ways to decipher them and expose the truth.

I just want to bring them into the light of day. To put it in adventurer terms, I guess for me... it's all about the thrill of the chase, and not the treasure at the end. I've also met a lot of people along the way: all my Fontaine friends, Euphrasie, who believes I was born to be a journalist, and people like you, who join me in the search for the truth. Without everyone's help, I'd probably still be that nosy kid who runs around furiously snapping photos like a lunatic... Anywho... It's not often that I get to be the interviewee, but... this has been a real pleasure.
Charlotte's HobbiesCharlotte's HobbiesMedia:VO_Charlotte Hobbies.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Charlotte_Hobbies.ogg I love collecting different Kamera lenses. They all have different strengths — some might have an incredible range of focal lengths, others might have a really wide field of view. Oh, and there's also more novelty ones that can apply special effects to the image. Take this one, for example — when you take a portrait photo with this, it turns their face all chubby... C'mon, I'll take one of you! And you, Paimon!
Charlotte's TroublesCharlotte's TroublesMedia:VO_Charlotte Troubles.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Charlotte_Troubles.ogg I've ended up with a less-than-favorable reputation in some people's eyes — I think it's because I can sometimes be a little bit, um... intense in interviews. Now, whenever I show up to interview someone, they're always really wary of me... *sigh* But in my defense, with some people, you really have to put the pressure on or they won't open up...

Media:vo charlotte mimitomo hello 01.ogg Charlotte: Hey, there you are! This sure is a mysterious place...
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo hello 02.ogg Charlotte: I've taken a ton of photos — and boy, do I have a list of questions for you!
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Charlotte: It's idyllic. And the lighting is perfect — you can take the most beautiful photos from literally any angle.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Charlotte: And yet... We're currently inside your teapot... right?
 That's right. Does that worry you?
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship1 03a 1.ogg Charlotte: No, not really. I was just wondering... What happens if someone opens the lid and pours water in?
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship1 03a 2.ogg Charlotte: How would that manifest in here? A flood? A storm? Would the water level start rising from beneath our feet?
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship1 03a 3.ogg Charlotte: I'd love to record that as it happens... Would you mind heading outside for a second and pouring some water in?
 I don't use this pot to brew tea. So don't worry.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship1 03b 1.ogg Charlotte: Really? You've never brewed tea in here? Ah, well that's a shame. I was going to ask you about how this unique environment affects the flavor of the tea.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship1 03b 2.ogg Charlotte: I heard this legend during an interview with someone from Liyue once. They said there was once an adeptus who poured half of the Bishui River into their teapot to brew some tea...
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship1 03b 3.ogg Charlotte: When the tea was ready, the adeptus poured the whole pot back into the river, and that's how the river got its distinct color.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship1 03b 4.ogg Charlotte: No idea if there's any truth to it... I'd sure like to taste the water from the Bishui River if I ever got the chance, just to see if there's any hint of a tea flavor.
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Charlotte: Sure — anything you wanna know about in particular? Ooh, I know... I'll tell you about the time that "Bedazzled!" caused a huge scandal.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Charlotte: They once ran a special report which claimed that the production and promotion of Fonta was part of a sinister plot by the Fontaine Research Institute.
 Sounds like a tasty conspiracy theory.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Charlotte: Right? Anyway, they put forward a theory that long-term consumption of Fonta makes human teeth and bones incredibly fragile.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Charlotte: It would end up destroying people's bodies to the point where they could no longer take care of themselves — even walking and eating would be agonizingly difficult.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Charlotte: Finally, people would be forced into relying on machines just to survive. And that's when the Fontaine Research Institute, who develops all kinds of meka, would swoop in to save the day and turn a huge profit in the process.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Charlotte: Most of my colleagues and I thought so, too. As far as we're concerned, "Bedazzled!" makes up things like this all the time, so we thought nothing of it.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Charlotte: But it turned out that a whole bunch of people who already hated Fonta were completely convinced it was true... Well, either that, or they saw it as a good opportunity to vent their grievances.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Charlotte: Either way, after that article was published, the Maison Gestion was inundated with complaint letters accusing Fonta of harming children.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Charlotte: They claimed that Fonta doesn't just damage childrens' teeth, but also stunts their growth, discourages them from drinking plain water, and ruins their appetites...
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Charlotte: It all got so out of hand that Mr. Heinry got pressured into doing a public interview with The Steambird, in which he stated that he would personally prove that Fonta was harmless...
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship2 11.ogg Charlotte: He declared that he would start drinking three cups of Fonta every day until he turned 60.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship2 12.ogg Charlotte: He also promised to publish the results of his monthly physical check-ups in The Steambird to make them available for public scrutiny.
 I shouldn't laugh, but... This is a hilarious story.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship2 13.ogg Charlotte: Hahaha, it really is. We've been joking about it in the office ever since. He's never gonna live this one down.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship2 14.ogg Charlotte: To his credit though, Mr. Heinry managed to turn the whole fiasco into a huge publicity stunt for Fonta. Their sales really rocketed for a while off the back of this.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship2 15.ogg Charlotte: And for all his big promises about publishing his monthly medical reports and drinking Fonta till he turned 60... Well, a few months later, everyone had moved on and forgotten all about it.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Charlotte: Well... I'd like to take some photos for work, if it's alright with you?
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Charlotte: I'd love to do a story about that big plump talking finch, for example. Now that would be an interesting read!
 You'd have to ask Tubby for her permission on that...
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Charlotte: Ahh, so Tubby's its name... Don't worry, I'm a professional! I always make sure to get people's consent before publishing anything that's specifically about them.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Charlotte: Speaking of consent, would you have any objections to the general public learning about this wondrous teapot of yours?
 Please keep my poor teapot out of the talons of The Steambird, Charlotte...
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Charlotte: Sure thing. If you're not comfortable with me reporting on it, I'll keep it out of the news.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Charlotte: But... Could you at least tell me... who made this teapot for you?
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Charlotte: An adeptus? Wow! Uh... Maybe you could introduce me? I'm so fascinated by the adepti — I'd love to learn more about them.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Charlotte: I hear there's all sorts of rules and taboos you have to observe when you're seeking an adeptus... Are you able to go over all of that with me?
 It's not that complicated. I can just take you there.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Charlotte: Really!? Amazing. Well that settles it — I'll put it in my schedule and come find you when I'm ready. No backing out, okay?
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Charlotte: ...I knew you were well-connected, but wow, fraternizing with the adepti? That's really incredible.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Charlotte: Now that I've got a friend like you, I'll never need to worry about networking again! Hahaha...
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Charlotte: An exclusive interview with an adeptus... What would a good title be? ..."Investigating an Adeptus"?
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship3 13.ogg Charlotte: No, no, no, it needs to sound more reverent — they'd probably have me thrown down the mountain for suggesting that...
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo friendship3 14.ogg Charlotte: Journey to Jueyun... Ooh, that's it! I think I'll go with: "Journey to Jueyun: Liyue's Pilgrim Trail."
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo morning 01.ogg Charlotte: Morning! Oh, snap, look at the time — I'd better go grab today's paper.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo morning 02.ogg Charlotte: I'll bring a copy back for you as well.
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo night 01.ogg Charlotte: Good night! Ahh... At this hour, I'd usually be proofreading a manuscript or drafting my next one...
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo night 02.ogg Charlotte: I'm not used to having so much free time. Hahaha...
Media:vo charlotte mimitomo night 03.ogg Charlotte: *gasp* Wait... Did I submit my latest article? I think I did...? Yeah, pretty sure I did...
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.
Media:vo mimitomo fd charlotte residentarea 01.ogg Charlotte: Whoa, this is giving me deja vu... Takes me right back to when I was a rookie journalist, scouring the streets for potential news stories.
Media:vo mimitomo fd charlotte residentarea 02.ogg Charlotte: Where you get a lot of people gathered in one place, information starts to circulate. It's out of that environment that news is born. So we're not likely to stumble across any big stories today, with only you and me here.
Media:vo mimitomo fd charlotte residentarea 03.ogg Charlotte: But that aside — if you're looking to stock up that newsstand, I recommend The Steambird.
Key to a Stable Work-Rest Cycle[]
Media:vo mimitomo fd charlotte residentareaindoors 01.ogg Charlotte: Hey, my place in the Court of Fontaine has the same furniture! But somehow, the sight of it has a weird way of making me sleepy...
Media:vo mimitomo fd charlotte residentareaindoors 02.ogg Charlotte: Oh, I know what it is... There've been times in the past when I've worked pretty much around the clock trying to make a deadline, and I'd be constantly going back and forth between a bed and a chair that are the spitting image of these.
Media:vo mimitomo fd charlotte residentareaindoors 03.ogg Charlotte: If it's okay with you, could I use this place as my secret writing chamber once in a while?
