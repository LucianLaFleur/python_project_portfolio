"Oh, come on! Everyone got this just for you!"
Barbara happily passed a wonderfully wrapped gift box to Rosaria, even as the latter looked on with a mix of suspicion and annoyance.
Tearing the packaging open, she found a note on the box cover across which elegant script flowed like music.
"Dear Sister Rosaria, we have asked Ms. Barbara to send this gift to you, but please, do open it somewhere where she can't see you."
Opening the box with her back turned, Rosaria discovered that the box contained still another note. It was thusly written in the same hand as before:
"Dear Sister Rosaria, we know that you don't appreciate having too many people know your birthday. However, this piece of information was written on your resume by Grandmaster [sic] Varka, so, on this important day, do allow the Church of Favonius to send you a new uniform, made just for you."
"If you're alright with it, stop being so aloof and be a normal Sister for once."
Deacon Dahlia (This letter was written at the request of Sister Victoria)
These are heard when equipping the costume.

In Chinese, Rosaria's third Outfit Switch Voice-Over may be a reference to Micah 7:19 in the Christian Bible.
The Chinese Union Version (CUV) of the verse reads: 必再怜悯我们、将我们的罪孽踏在脚下、又将我们的一切罪投于深海。[1] The 将(...)踏在脚下 phrasing is repeated in Rosaria's line, 将昨日踏在脚下吧。, or "Let us  tread yesterday underfoot."
In the American Standard Version (ASV) of the Bible, the verse reads: "He will again have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea."[2]

Rosaria, a sister in Mondstadt's Church of Favonius.A sister of the church, though you wouldn't know it if it weren't for her attire. An unusual woman with sharp, piercing words and a cold manner.Her movements are unpredictable. She often leaves without notifying anyone. She acts with some kind of purpose, but others don't seem to know exactly what she stands for...—Description from the Official Website[1]
A sister of the church, though you wouldn't know it if it weren't for her attire. Known for her sharp, cold words and manner, she often works alone.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Rosaria is a somewhat intimidating woman who has a rather unorthodox idea of piety. Kaeya describes her as someone who is "honest with herself". She dislikes topics that bore her and having to work overtime. Fischl overheard her cursing out someone in Barbatos' name and takes it as a sign of Rosaria's piety, an interpretation Oz doubts. Like Fischl, her intuition is very keen, as she's well aware that Diluc, Kaeya, Venti and Albedo are more than what they appear to be.
Despite her position in the church, Rosaria is the least devout; she is always guaranteed to skip all church activities when possible and the first one to leave if she is forced to attend.[2] While she does recite prayers, she does not remember Barbatos' name due to her lack of devotion, frequently mispronouncing his name.[3]
Secretly, she acts as a purveyor of justice for the Church, investigating potential threats to Mondstadt and eliminating them if necessary. She is particularly skilled in killing, having been taught by her former "family", a group of bandits before they had been wiped out by the Knights of Favonius.[2] Due to being offered a chance for redemption by Grand Master Varka, Rosaria sees herself differently to the people of Mondstadt,[2] and is indebted to them for their unselfish warmth and goodwill.[4]

Rosaria uses the tall female model. She has ghostly pale gray skin, pale magenta eyes with narrow white pupils, and choppy wine-colored hair cut short in the back with a shoulder-length fringe and some strands of her bangs colored a darker red.
As she is always seen with her coif on, which is dark red on the inner surface, the soft contrast with her hair color can lead the player at first glance to assume that her hair is much longer at the back than it actually is.
Light creates shadow, but shadow will not be controlled by light
Where did Rosaria go off to this time...? Oh, has anyone seen her? There's choir practice today. Deacon Dahlia told me I must ask her to come!—Barbara
A sister in Mondstadt's Church of Favonius.
At a glance, she appears to be a usual member of the clergy, but after observing her behavior, you would find she is anything but.
Her reverence for the gods is less than that of even the average citizen of Mondstadt, and she never participates in the activities of the Church.
Rosaria is an unusual loner who is a sister of the Church in name only.
But don't forget that wherever light may reach, there will also be shadow.
Rosaria is one of the sisters of Mondstadt's Church of Favonius.Though she is just as much a woman of the cloth as the likes of Barbara and Jilliana, people tend to make a mental distinction between Rosaria and other members of the clergy.While she might dress the part — at least, to a certain extent — her speech and actions do not reflect her office in the slightest.Furthermore, she displays even less reverence towards the gods than the ordinary citizens, and she routinely skips her various church engagements.She comes, goes, and acts in solitude, and if she were ever to make an appearance in the Cathedral, it would be to smoke in the rearmost pew.Such a lone wolf is Rosaria that perhaps she should be considered a clergywoman in name only.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
If Rosaria has been lectured once, she has been lectured a thousand times before concerning her unorthodox behavior.For some reason, however, she has never faced any serious consequences for her transgressions. She does not work together with her church colleagues and only rarely shows up to celebratory events in the city.The strange and mysterious Rosaria moves about almost like a wisp of black smoke — blink, and you'll miss her as she disappears into thin air.Her social interactions are never more than superficial, and the rest of the time she keeps herself to herself.However, Sister Victoria would say that the ever good-natured Barbara is one person who has always made the effort to get close to Rosaria."Please don't smoke in the Cathedral..." "Could you try to attend the ceremony on time next time...?""And... Hey, come back, I'm still talking to you!"Barbara is forever anxiously chasing after Rosaria, urging her to complete her various daily tasks.Yet even when faced with Barbara, the beloved idol of Mondstadt, Rosaria remains completely unmoved.Surely her heart can't be completely made of stone?Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
Rosaria's movements are unpredictable. She often leaves without notifying anyone and can be gone for up to several days on end.During these times, none of her church colleagues know where to find her.One of the sisters who took it upon herself to observe Rosaria once groused that "even a stray cat should at least give you notice before running off..."Rosaria uses these disappearances to do work that only she can do in corners unseen by others.An unfamiliar merchant, a suspicious traveler — are these people threats to Mondstadt?She investigates, shadows, and if necessary, interrogates.If they must disappear, then Rosaria shall be the last person they meet.Such dark work, which cannot see the light of day, is to be done by her hand alone.She always sets out after the sun has set, finishing her work in one fell swoop. Sometimes, if she makes it back by the crack of dawn, she gets to usher in the day ahead with a glass of breakfast wine.The people of Mondstadt live in the golden sunlight, but Rosaria dwells under the silver moonlight.It is a cold, piercing light... just like that of the ice she forms with her Cryo abilities."There are some things that young people need not know," Rosaria thinks.Though, in her eyes, "young people" means all citizens of Mondstadt who live in the light of the sun, regardless of their age.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Like a puff of smoke, the lackadaisical Rosaria is impossible to pin down.Nevertheless, once she takes on a job, she can be relied on to handle it with the utmost professionalism."Lazy" is the last word that anyone would use to describe her ruthless interrogations of suspicious individuals.She also possesses exceptional strength and knows the weaknesses of the human body like the back of her hand — and has no reservations about using this knowledge to kill.People know her as the lazy, chain-smoking sister, but behind the scenes, she is a formidable purveyor of justice.A strange fate for one who ostensibly basks in the light of the gods.What led her to become a blood-soaked slayer? Why does she stay silent while others praise the gods for their protection?Perhaps it should come as no surprise that Rosaria was not born and bred in Mondstadt."A city that is fortunate enough to be boring always needs someone to do the dirty work..."Rosaria stubs her cigarette out as she speaks in her characteristically languid manner."And as far as I'm concerned, the things I deal with are far simpler than living the life of a traditional sister."Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Rosaria may not be one to attend prayer meetings, but that does not mean she doesn't have her own theological viewpoints.In her view, freedom is the spiritual pillar of Mondstadt's people, and it is the very thing that caused her to end up here in the first place.Rosaria was born in a remote mountain village, but was taken from her home shortly after birth by the very same bandits who drenched it in blood.Raised by those crooks, she learned how to fight, sometimes thieving, other times doing odd jobs for the crew.She was their servant, but also their tool, a crook, yet still a child.She fought against outsiders and her comrades alike, and growing up was a constant battle for survival against the hunger and cold.Rosaria's youth was just like Mondstadt's sunset — blood-red from horizon to horizon, and so fleeting that night had fallen before she'd had the chance to stop and take in the view.Ultimately, the bandit crew was wiped out by the Knights of Favonius. As their youngest member, Rosaria was judged to have a chance of rehabilitation.Grand Master Varka brought her to Mondstadt. Sincerely hoping that she might someday fit in here, he advised her:"Go to the Cathedral and be cleansed by the light of our archon. You still have the chance to turn your fate around and live a normal life."But Varka had not counted on Rosaria constantly skipping classes and dodging hymnal.She would rather hunt in the wild than settle into a life of dutiful service as a sister. As far as she was concerned, the golden sunlight was not so much cleansing as blinding.For Rosaria had long since come to understand that she was a child of the moonlight, and it was inevitable that she would someday return to the embrace of darkness.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Rosaria, the Church's number one truant, became infamous for her absence very early on."Miss Rosaria, please, show a little more circumspection in your actions! You are a member of the Church. How is it appropriate that you simply never turn up for hymn practice?""Please calm down, Sister Ophila. Miss Rosaria, I'm told that you have never attended a single one of your compulsory classes. Is that so?""Yes.""Mother Maria, please look at this... Rosaria's theological essay is an utter mess!""Miss Rosaria, if I may ask frankly... do you intend to do any work at all here at the Church?""No. I've already found other work."Rosaria never showed so much as a hint of anxiety in any of these exchanges. What's more, it was true — she had indeed found other work for herself, and much darker work at that.The unexpected twist was that she would ultimately end up doing this work under the aegis of the Church.Rosaria the novice did not leave the clergy, but instead became Sister Rosaria without much incident.Nevertheless, when she's not on a mission, she does everything she can to avoid attending church activities, instead heading to the taverns to drink or scaling the city walls to view the scenery.And when she simply cannot escape a church engagement, you can be sure that she will be the first to leave.The instant the workday is done, Rosaria vanishes.Whether by bright day or dark night, there is one principle that she will never transgress: no overtime.Church-Issue Journal Friendship Lv. 4
A journal with a white cover. The words "Church of Favonius" are inscribed on the cover.The handwriting is beautiful, but the content is the most of the most banal variety imaginable."Dandelion Wine — now eighty percent off!""Fisherman's Toast — an incredible flavor at an unbelievable price!""Crazy discounts on Wheat — ask at the counter and we'll grind it into Flour for you.""Buy three Tomatoes and get one free!""Fresh Small Lamp Grass! Use it to light up your bathroom! Come on, Sir, have a look!"There is something incongruous about a random assortment of marketplace cries and advertising slogans having been penned by such a graceful and elegant hand.This journal is a relic from Rosaria's novice days.Clearly, she must have skipped class and headed to the rooftops on the merchant street, bathing in the sun, listening to the eclectic cries of the street vendors, and committing them to paper.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
Rosaria's Vision came to her on a particularly frigid night.Things were getting desperate for the bandit gang — people were starving and the food supplies were dwindling.Never able to eat her fill, Rosaria was driven by hunger to flee into the freezing wind rather than continue another second with the hard labor she was forced to endure.One of the elders of the gang pursued her and brought her back.He was the very person who had taken her from the village of her birth, and the one who had taught her how to kill."Fleeing makes you a traitor, and traitors can only earn their freedom through victory in combat."The old bandit tossed Rosaria an old dagger."Well, come on then! Kill me, and you can leave this place. I'm long in the tooth now, while you've got youth on your side. You can do this, can't ya?"No one thought that she would be able to kill him — and yet, the old lion would indeed fall by the newborn cub's claws.Thus did the bandits lose an old member and welcome a new one that very night.The bandits were reluctant to accept Rosaria at first since she had slain one of their own, but they quickly had a change of heart after seeing the Vision in her hand.Surely, a Vision wielder had to be far stronger than some old coot who was about to kick the bucket right? And she ate less, to boot... They could save some food this way.Meanwhile, a question crept into Rosaria's frozen heart:Did he let me replace him on purpose? ...Could a false father have harbored genuine affection for a child he stole so arbitrarily?
Obtain:Reward for reaching Friendship Level 10 with RosariaDescription:The unselfish warmth and goodwill of the people is, to her, a kindness that she must repay, and so it is an indenture that follows her forever.

Media:vo rosaria mimitomo hello 01.ogg Rosaria: *yawn* What time is it...
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Rosaria: There's no like or dislike. I'm not particular with my residences.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Rosaria: But it is certainly more comfortable here than at the Cathedral...
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Rosaria: At least no one's going to wake me up for morning prayer and prevent me from catching up on my sleep.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship1 04a 1.ogg Rosaria: Haha... thanks for your concern. I just have a few things to take care of.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship1 04a 2.ogg Rosaria: I've lived this way for such a long time, it'd be strange to change.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship1 04b 1.ogg Rosaria: ...There's nothing to thank me for.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship1 04b 2.ogg Rosaria: ...Nevermind, I know you mean well.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Rosaria: Perhaps I'm more comfortable here than I thought I was.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Rosaria: Hmm... I'm getting soft. That won't do.
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Rosaria: Sure. But let me make this clear: If you're looking to confess, you should go find someone else.
 Sounds like there's a story behind that.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship2 02a 1.ogg Rosaria: Ha... so, I was on duty this one time, receiving confessions from believers.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship2 02a 2.ogg Rosaria: And, it was hard enough to make sense of their jumbled confessions, but then I had to use useless words like "May the Anemo Archon bless you" to make them feel better.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship2 02a 3.ogg Rosaria: Ugh. Archons have mercy on me.
 I'm not interested in confessionals.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship2 02b 1.ogg Rosaria: Great. Then we're on the same page.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship2 02b 2.ogg Rosaria: Instead of wasting your time sobbing and confessing your sins at church, you're better off repenting with concrete actions.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Rosaria: However, a lot of people believe that misfortune and suffering will never touch them because they're blessed by Barbatos.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Rosaria: I mean, sure, if this way of thinking makes them happier, then they can keep believing.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Rosaria: Wait... Was it Bartobas? O—Or was it Barsibato? I feel like I said it wrong again.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Rosaria: Yeah, let's go with that. Barbatos it is.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Rosaria: Um... Also, thanks.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Rosaria: Being able to talk to you so casually without having to worry about being nagged is quite the luxury.
 Is there anything you'd like to do?
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Rosaria: Hmm... Let's go to the tavern.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Rosaria: We'll drink to our hearts' delight, and who cares if we get drunk?
 I can't imagine you being drunk.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Rosaria: ...I've never allowed myself to get drunk.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Rosaria: I used to think it was idiotic to leave yourself vulnerable in front of others.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Rosaria: But my perspective on that has changed.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Rosaria: Huh... Maybe it's because I trust you... but that's beside the point.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Rosaria: Angel's Share or The Cat's Tail, which one you wanna go to?
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship3 08a 1.ogg Rosaria: If it's from Dawn Winery, you can be absolutely assured of its quality.
Media:vo rosaria mimitomo friendship3 08a 2.ogg Rosaria: I'd recommend their Dandelion Wine.
