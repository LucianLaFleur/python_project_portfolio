Released in Version 1.2[Create New History]
A light and graceful festive outfit accented mainly in black nightshade and cerulean blue. Its hair accessory is as radiant as the Qingxin — a pairing that Ganyu is most fond of.
Twilight Blossom is a 4-Star Character Outfit for Ganyu. It is purchasable from the Character Outfit Shop.
During Version 4.4, Twilight Blossom was available at a limited-time discount of  Genesis Crystal ×1,350. In Version 4.5, its cost was increased to  Genesis Crystal ×1,680.
Ganyu's hair is styled into an odango bun wrapped around by a braid, dressed up by a golden hairpin with a floral design and a hanging red tassel.
Ganyu wears a high-neck leotard in dark nightshade and cerulean blue, with chest and back openings covered in dark sheer fabric. The two-piece bodice extends to crotch height in the front and knee-length in the back, emblisheed with gold accents, jacquard patterns, and star glitters. A large, ruffles bow in light blue is mounted at her lower back, akin to a tail coat. A Glaze Lily shaped knot is affixed on her left hip, where the Vision situated. A partially flattened golden bell is tightened around her neck by a black ribbon. 
She also wears sheer opera gloves with layered cuffs, lace garters, and closed-toe sandals decorated with small bows. Qingxin-inspired ornaments are attached to her hairpins, dress, garters, and sandals.
While wearing Twilight Blossom, when Ganyu's Elemental Burst is ready, the teal gem that connected the hanging red tassel with her hairpin will glow along with her Vision.
Thanks to her marvelous half-adeptus constitution, Ganyu's capacity to endure hardship far surpasses the average mortal, and so she spends all year rushing to and fro on business for Yuehai Pavilion and the Ministry of Civil Affairs, her work unceasing even as day turns into night turns back into day. Naturally, she has little mind to spare for matters of personal dress, to say nothing of accessories or makeup.
Over time, her everyday appearance and the word "busy" have become tightly bound. Even when she is spotted on her brief days off, one cannot help but worriedly picture her doing overtime till she practically falls asleep standing up, or wonder if she might suddenly do an about-face and make a beeline to take care of the nearest article of urgent business.
Xianyun saw all this, of course, and had long been considering countermeasures. Just as well, then, that Lantern Rite was imminent, and a suggestion that she had heard on the streets came to mind:
"A change of clothes may make for a change of mood..."
Thus did the adeptus retrieve a machine she had sealed in storage for many years. Using it, some of her friend Ping's best Silk Flowers, and the dyes made using divine herbs from her abode, she weaved several bolts of fabric and satin of immaculate quality and color. As for the exquisite hair ornaments and pendants, they were made of the same material as her adeptal machines. Elegant, lovely, and infused with faint fragrance.
Then, Xianyun brought the fabric and satin to one of the finest tailors in Liyue Harbor, though she did give the poor artisan quite a fright — after all, any ordinary valuation would appraise these materials at a price point somewhere around "couldn't get more expensive if you'd just melted Mora down and spun it into silk."
Xianyun was pleased indeed with that reaction.
"One's disciple has worked many years at Yuehai Pavilion — a figure of standing and repute, surely, and more than worthy of such finery!"
Of course, Xianyun did not mention the unique aspects of the fabric or the accessories when she gave Ganyu this gift, mentioning only that the tailor's craftmanship had satisfied her.
Nonetheless, Ganyu could intuit the value of the raiment and the thought her master put into its impeccable artisanry from how the garment seemed to flow like water in her hands.
And so she changed out of her usual working clothes and came out, light of heart, to meet the adeptus and her gathered friends, and at that moment her mood did quietly change—
As the clear starry night sky, as a tranquil scene of fragrant blossoms.
"Putting duty aside to spend a carefree Lantern Rite with everyone... This, too, is an experience precious beyond measure."
These are heard when equipping the costume.

OverviewLoreVoice-OversOutfitsCompanionGallery
The secretary to the Liyue Qixing. The blood of both human and illuminated beast flows within her veins.Graceful and quiet by nature, yet the gentle disposition of qilin sees not even the slightest conflict with even the most arduous of workloads.After all, Ganyu firmly believes that all the work she does is in honor of her contract with Rex Lapis, seeking the well-being of all living things within Liyue.—Description from the Official Website[1]
The secretary at Yuehai Pavilion. The blood of the qilin, an illuminated beast, flows within her veins.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Ganyu is usually very meek, mild-mannered, and reserved due to her half-qilin heritage, and is easily flustered. She also completes whatever is given to her, whether it be tasks or food, even if she is reluctant to do so.[2][3] Privately, she tends to snap whenever people speak ill of Beidou[4] or the Geo Archon. She greatly respects her fellow adepti, especially Xiao and Cloud Retainer, seeing them as a mentor and a maternal figure respectively, although she becomes extremely anxious in the latter's presence due to her tendency to unintentionally ramble.
Ganyu has served as the non-stopping secretary of the Liyue Qixing for thousands of years. The more important the task is, the more effort she puts into it, but she also becomes increasingly nervous and is more prone to making mistakes.[5]
She has a huge work schedule, often working overtime and is prone to falling asleep. As a result, Ganyu has very few friends outside of work. Due to her age, she is very forgetful, and she often forgets important details which causes her much embarrassment. She is very sensitive about her horns, weight and childhood, becoming visibly flustered when any of these three are mentioned in front of her.
See also: Frostdew Trail and Twilight Blossom
Ganyu uses the medium female model. She has fair skin and cerulean blue hair that naturally bunches in the middle and fades into a darker shade at the ends. She has black-red horns that bend back along her hair, similar to how a goat's horns look, with brighter red markings on them. She has eyes that appear to exhibit sectoral heterochromia, fading from purple at the top to pinkish-gold at the bottom.
Drink only spring water, eat only whole grain. Proceed with elegance, avoid certain peril.
It is said that the qilin carry an auspicious grace, yet who knows of the loneliness of a benevolent being among the sea of people?—Tianshu of the Liyue Qixing
For the Liyue Qixing of the lofty Yujing Terrace, Ganyu is not merely a companion to serve them, but is instead coordinator of the web of information that moves across Liyue Harbor, and the architect of administrative efficiency.
Complex meeting minutes, disorderly report data... Every day piles of documents flow by like water, each one personally compiled by her into clear and concise words in order to assist the Qixing's every decision and negotiation as they flow through various organizational departments.
In the eons that have gone by, the Qixing have changed with each succession of their posts, while only Ganyu has lived to see the flourishing of Liyue Harbor from beginning to the modern day.
The human blood that runs through her veins makes her reluctant to leave the splendor of the city lights, while her adeptus side leads her to yearn for the gentle serenity of her adeptal homeland.
For the half-human, half-adeptus Ganyu, between the bustling sea of people and the ethereal clustered peaks, which is more fitting to call home?
Though many in Liyue are fascinated by life in Yujing Terrace, its day-to-day operations and rules are a mystery to them.They are aware that the Liyue Qixing are the cream of the crop who hold the fate of the city in their hands, but the calculations and data behind the Qixing's every decision are far harder to grasp.The people understand that the new policies announced each year will change the dynamics of the market, yet none can comprehend how policy is plucked from complex meeting minutes and compiled into something easier on the human eye.As the secretary of Yuehai Pavilion, Ganyu undertakes many tasks that ordinary folk do not see.For those that have witnessed her standing by the dock at daybreak, enjoying her breakfast in silence, it is difficult to imagine her in such a post.Even still, by the time the sun has fully risen, she will have returned to Yuehai Pavilion overlooking Yujing Terrace, to continue to fulfill her contract.A contract that she signed three thousand years ago with Rex Lapis.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Ganyu is not the secretary of any one leader in the Liyue Qixing but is instead the general secretary for the entire organization. Under her gentle exterior, Ganyu is as persevering as stone itself. This was something that Rex Lapis, the leader of the adepti, noticed very early on. Thus when the Liyue Qixing first emerged ages ago, Ganyu was their secretary. Through the years and the changes in the Qixing's roster, Ganyu has remained by their side as a constant. This has also meant that the mountainous piles of paperwork from the various departments and bureaus in Liyue have fallen upon Ganyu's shoulders. But though her workload has increased seven, a hundred, or even a thousandfold, her sense of responsibility has never wavered. Someone once queried as to the source of her motivation and received an answer that was not quite congruous with the question. "What I've done... is nothing compared to what Rex Lapis has accomplished."Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
"I work for the well-being of all living things in Liyue."Under almost all circumstances, Ganyu is a very trustworthy secretary.It is hard to imagine anyone outperforming her in the face of such an enormous workload, especially given her unique and penetrating insights into all of Liyue's matters.Nevertheless, her reliability can only be guaranteed under "almost all circumstances."The more important the matter, the more Ganyu strives for perfection, and the more nervous she becomes. Under pressure, her nervousness does result in the occasional error.One such incident occurred during the Rite of Descension, without doubt the most important annual event in Liyue's calendar.Ganyu was three minutes late for the Rite and had to squeeze through the crowd in full view of all.Later on, with a face as red as a tomato, she stammered her way through an unconvincing explanation, all the while apologizing profusely to Rex Lapis in her heart.Her colleagues guessed that there must be some reason for the mistake.Those who did not know her well saw that Rex Lapis did not mind, and thus paid the incident no attention.Those closer to her worried in private, and asked if she needed a workload adjustment or a short vacation, but Ganyu refused."I spent two hours making sure that I wasn't wearing anything too similar to last year's Rite..."Needless to say, Ganyu was not about to admit to this being the real reason for her tardiness!Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
How long is a thousand years?Long enough for the Glaze Lilies that once teemed throughout Dihua Marsh to be wiped out by floodwaters, and long enough for the thriving settlement that sprung up upon Guili Plains to come to ruin in war.How short is a thousand years?To Ganyu, it has felt shorter than the blink of an eye.Throughout a passage of time unimaginable to mortals, Ganyu has been working on all manner of things at Yujing Terrace.She recorded the raising and demolishing of every building, and witnessed the rise to prosperity of every industry.Ganyu's sense of objectivity towards the passage of time comes from the endless reams of data she must trawl through, and from the ever-increasing number of colors she finds that she needs to categorize it all.All this time, her mindset has never changed — she constantly wavers between her human and adeptus halves.On one hand, Ganyu the qilin finds it difficult to comprehend mortal squabbles.But on the other hand, her human blood reminds her always to hold out hope that she might someday be able to fit in.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Outside the confines of her work, Ganyu very quickly shows how different she is from most other people.She has a habit of taking afternoon naps and has a shockingly accurate internal clock. When lunch hour arrives, no matter where she is, she will simply curl up into a ball and fall asleep on the spot. Even the raucous dancing of hilichurls will fail to wake her.These habits were at first just a running joke within the Liyue Qixing.But once, after accompanying the then-Tianxuan to lunch outside the city, a well-fed Ganyu simply crawled into the nearest roadside haystack. She ended up being transported all the way to Dihua Marsh, awakening only after bumping her head during the unloading.Unable to find Ganyu anywhere over the subsequent three hours, and knowing that she would not depart unannounced, the Tianxuan almost filed a missing person report.After receiving a stern admonishment to "only take afternoon naps where it's safe," Ganyu retorted:"Well... isn't everywhere in Liyue safe?"Perhaps, with the mixture of human and illuminated beast blood flowing through her veins, Ganyu's understanding of the world's affairs is a little different to that of most humans.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Ganyu's qilin heritage is little-known in Liyue Harbor.Whenever she is asked by someone walking along Feiyun Slope as to the obvious protrusions in her hair, she says that they are ornamental heirlooms."If I told them the truth, they would distance themselves from me..."Despite never having been on particularly close terms with Liyue's citizens in the first place, Ganyu would still not consider distancing to be a good thing.Her more important reason for hiding the truth is to prevent curious onlookers from touching her qilin horns.After all, a qilin's horns are a sensitive part of their body, both physically and mentally speaking.Another secret that Ganyu is anxious to keep hidden is the fact that she is watching her physique.The qilin are strict vegetarians, but Liyue is a veritable powerhouse of gastronomical delights, one in which even vegetarians struggle to control their appetites.Ganyu, who has grown accustomed to city life, is thus very vigilant in matters concerning her weight and physique.Whenever she finds herself being drawn towards some delicious dish, she will attempt to reassert her self-control. For Ganyu, the difficulty of such a challenge is second only to finding a Flaming Flower atop Dragonspine.But she is not one to give up half-way through the ascent.During the Archon War, she once choked a giant monster to death with ease after getting lodged in its throat when it tried to eat her, said monster having fatally underestimated quite how wide her waistline was.For Ganyu, avoiding any similarly embarrassing episodes in the future is an absolute must.The Flora of Yujing Terrace Friendship Lv. 4
Handwritten notes detail the morphological features and behaviors of the plants in Yujing Terrace, with each beautiful stroke penned by Ganyu's own hand.The notes are succinct, comprehensive, and well-categorized, and even offer some insights that one would be hard-pressed to find elsewhere on the market.These include pointers on caring for Glaze Lilies and methods for grafting Silk Flowers.In readability and scientific accessibility, they come close to the standard of official publications.Or rather, this is the experience if one starts reading from the front.Skip to near the end, however, and one may well be left dumbfounded.The final few pages are a shocking rash of black ink and frantically scribbled-out text.Reading patiently and painstakingly between the lines, one might just discover that these notes were, at one time, various methods for vegetable cultivation."But if I learn to grow vegetables, I'll be even less able to control my appetite."Her hands balling into fists, it was with much difficulty that Ganyu erased the results of her research.Later, whilst watering the plants on an empty stomach, Ganyu found herself plunging her head into a thicket of Silk Flowers, fantasizing that they were Sweet Flowers in an effort to comfort herself.Many more fantasy Sweet Flowers followed shortly afterward during her afternoon nap...Vision Friendship Lv. 6
Qilin are paragons of benevolence among the adepti, drinking only freshwater and eating only plants. Flies they will not hurt, and a bruised reed they will not break. They do not travel abroad, do not gather in herds, and no trap will hold them. They are leisurely yet composed, active but reserved — a gentle and elegant race. Yet when a wicked beast from the sea arose and threatened the land beneath their feet, that peaceful life ceased to be an option. Three thousand years ago, Ganyu answered the call of Morax the God of Geo, aiding him in the Archon Wars. And when the war was over, she chose to stay in Liyue and help the humans build a better polity there. The first Liyue Qixing would need support, and she took this task up as a matter of course, becoming their secretary. The moment she made that decision, a Vision appeared at her hip, granting her power to resonate with the world to a degree beyond her natural abilities. Whether she would grow strong enough to no longer need it, or whether she would use it as a last resort in Liyue's defense... Regardless, she chose to serve as the bridge between adepti and humans. Her Vision, then, was proof and witness of her new duty.

If you want to know about her past... You should ask her about it. I fear my wording would not be delicate enough to receive her approval.MailsSenderMailsXianyunMortal Comforts...

I've Been Thinking... (2021-12-02)Moongazing... (2022-12-02)Fishing... (2023-12-02)
According to Xiangling, Ganyu has a surprisingly large appetite — Xiangling and Chef Mao give her an extra-large portion of food on the occasions she eats at Wanmin Restaurant, but she always manages to finish it.[6][7]
According to Yaoyao's message on the Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board, Ganyu has a sensitive stomach and cannot handle spicy food.
Ganyu's Character Story 5 suggests that at the time of the Archon War, Ganyu was not as slim as she is today as her waistline "easily" choked a monster to death when it tried to swallow her whole, to her embarrassment. She has since taken efforts to watch her figure.
Although Ganyu and her Character Stories say she is vegetarian, she may actually be vegan: During Spices From the West, she declines meatless dishes that include Bird Eggs or Milk, such as Fragrant Almond Tofu, Fragrant Satisfying Salad, and Fragrant Fisherman's Toast.
However, the canonicity of playable characters' preferences during Spices From the West is questionable.
In the corresponding voice-over (Receiving a Gift: III), Ganyu declines solely on the basis of the dish containing meat, which does not make sense when she declines meatless dishes.
Zhongli politely declines all seafood, including Fragrant Grilled Tiger Fish and Fragrant Mondstadt Grilled Fish, but his Character Story That Which Rises From the Sea indicates that he only dislikes tentacled seafood and will happily eat even tentacled seafood that has been cut into small pieces. Zhongli's Character Story 1 also heavily implies that he has eaten Fullmoon Egg, which uses both cut and whole Shrimp. It therefore does not make sense that Zhongli declines even Grilled Tiger Fish and Mondstadt Grilled Fish, which are small portions[8] of cut fish.
Ganyu can be seen using Amos' Bow in a cutscene of Where the Heart Finds Rest in the battle against Beisht.
Ganyu leaves her own message on the Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board, albeit anonymously.
Cloud Retainer said that when Ganyu was young, she loved it when her horns were caressed.[9]She also reveals that Ganyu's first encounter with a human was bumping into a pilgrim while falling down a mountain. The experience scared her so much that she hid in a rock's cleft for two days.
Looking at her character for a period of time causes her to blush.
Ganyu got to meet Guizhong, the God of Dust, a few times.[10]
There are contradictions regarding when Ganyu signed her contract with Rex Lapis:
Ganyu tells the Traveler she signed her contract with Rex Lapis shortly after the Archon War ended around two thousand years ago.[11]
Her character profile states she signed the contract three thousand years ago, during the Archon War.[12]
Zhongli says Ganyu has served the longest of those who honor a contract with Rex Lapis.[13] However, there are other adepti whose contracts pre-date the two times given for Ganyu's:
Rex Lapis founded Liyue Harbor and signed the first contracts to defend it with the adepti 3,700 years ago,[14] after relocating the people from the destroyed Guili Assembly. Cloud Retainer, Moon Carver, Mountain Shaper, and a qilin, who may be Ganyu herself or another individual, were among those who made that journey.[15]
Ganyu's Chinese voice actress (林簌) is one of the directors of Genshin Impact's Chinese voice actors.[Note 1] She is also the Chinese voice actress of Jean.
In the Chinese translation of her Story Quest, Uncle Tian refers to her as "older sister Ganyu" citing it a childhood name, despite the former looking much more advanced in age, which showcases how much Ganyu has remained unchanged over the years.
Ganyu is known by these aliases or titles:
Little Miss Ganyu (CN: older sister Ganyu) (by Uncle Tian)
In her voice-over Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion, Ganyu mentions a quote from an ancient text saying "Only when days be darker than the darkest night, may a qilin be compelled to fight." In the Chinese version, the corresponding quotation is "麟斗则日无光," which translates to "The term líndǒu (lit. "the battle of a female qilin") refers to no light in the sun (that is, eclipse)." The text is from a Chinese esoteric book called Kǒngyǎntú (Chinese: 孔演图) (also known as Chūnqiū-Yǎnkǒngtú (Chinese: 春秋演孔图)) written during the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD).[16]
Ganyu shares the same Japanese voice actress, Ueda Reina (上田麗奈), with Sparkle from Honkai: Star Rail.
Ganyu's name (甘雨 Gānyǔ) literally means "sweet rain," but as a phrase, it refers to "timely rainfall" such as rain after a long drought.
Her Constellation, "Sinae Unicornis," is Latin for "Chinese Unicorn," another western name/descriptor for the Qilin.
↑ Bilibili: In the CN 1.1 livestream (~ 1:28), Paimon's VA notes that this is the first time with two of the voice acting directors in one livestream. Jean/Ganyu's VA then proceeds to ask her if she feels pressured by that.

About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Ganyu About the Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_About_the_Vision.ogg "With authority over a thousand comes responsibility to a thousand." Rex Lapis knows the meaning of hardship better than anyone else in Liyue — he has seen everything that has happened from ancient times to the present day, and yet he was forced to give up his entire life. Compared to him, I'm just an everyday Vision holder with everyday responsibilities. I can't complain about my workload.
Something to ShareSomething to ShareMedia:VO_Ganyu Something to Share.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_Something_to_Share.ogg "Where merchants flock and all ships dock, and over the oceans flows its stock." People say this in praise of Liyue's prosperity. But a city only becomes this successful through everyone playing their part diligently. That's the attitude I take to my work — I want to be worthy of what we enjoy here.
Interesting Facts: NameInteresting Facts: NameMedia:VO_Ganyu Interesting Facts - Name.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_Interesting_Facts_-_Name.ogg I've named every single doggie living in Liyue. But they're so funny, some of them still respond even when you call them the completely wrong name. How fascinating is that? Like, if people were to call me "Bantu," how am I supposed to know they're talking to me? No way would I respond.
Interesting Facts: QingxinInteresting Facts: QingxinMedia:VO_Ganyu Interesting Facts - Qingxin.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_Interesting_Facts_-_Qingxin.ogg Qingxin Flower petals are pretty tasty. Incredibly tasty, actually. The only reason I don't plant any at Yujing Terrace is because they taste so good that I worry I wouldn't be able to control myself... Huh? Bitter... Yes, they are... Isn't that what they're supposed to taste like?
About Morax: Trust Friendship Lv. 4About Morax: Trust Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Ganyu About Morax - Trust.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_About_Morax_-_Trust.ogg I have absolute faith in Rex Lapis. It was only through his leadership that we were able to repel the monsters and subdue the sea creatures, and thus protect the peace of Liyue. The sight of him protecting the masses, and the memory of our centuries of camaraderie... I shall never forget it.
About Morax: Follower Friendship Lv. 4About Morax: Follower Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Ganyu About Morax - Follower.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_About_Morax_-_Follower.ogg All of Rex Lapis' decisions prioritize the welfare of all life in Liyue. That's what I admire about him the most. I want to live up to the same standard... but it seems that the harder I try to follow in his footsteps, the more overwhelmed I get and the more mistakes I make...
About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Ganyu About Ningguang.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_About_Ningguang.ogg Each Tianquan adds their own interpretation and amendments to the founding laws of Liyue. The current one, Ningguang, does it with unmatched efficiency, but that efficacious manner of hers draws a great deal of criticism. I suppose it is always simpler to criticize than to tolerate.
About Keqing: Estrangement Friendship Lv. 4About Keqing: Estrangement Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Ganyu About Keqing - Estrangement.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_About_Keqing_-_Estrangement.ogg I cannot stand her disrespectful attitude towards Rex Lapis! But he says to me, "Ganyu, this is just the kind of person Liyue needs in this day and age." I guess I'm not smart enough, because I simply do not understand what he means by that. I think I need more life experience to become wise enough to comprehend his words.
About Keqing: Changing Perspective Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star ApproachesAbout Keqing: Changing Perspective Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star ApproachesMedia:VO_Ganyu About Keqing - Changing Perspective.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_About_Keqing_-_Changing_Perspective.ogg She came to me recently to discuss the reopening of the Bishui trade route. She even asked me what Rex Lapis would do if it were him. Admittedly, what we came up with was not quite on par with what he would have chosen. But... seeing the way she kept starting her plan from scratch over and over again, I think I started to understand her a little bit.
About Xingqiu Friendship Lv. 4About Xingqiu Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Ganyu About Xingqiu.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_About_Xingqiu.ogg You mean the boy in the blue jacket from the Feiyun Commerce Guild? He's nothing like his father and brother, doesn't seem to care about the textile business at all. Seems it's because as far as he's concerned, there are more important things for him to be doing. Of course, I'm merely speculating...
About Xiangling Friendship Lv. 4About Xiangling Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Ganyu About Xiangling.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_About_Xiangling.ogg Xiangling is a celebrity! Um, but... I try to avoid her restaurant. Just... because. No reason. ...Okay, fine. It's not a big secret anyway. It's because you can smell her cooking all the way from the other end of the street. And once you get a whiff, I mean, that's it. You're gone. Next thing you know, you're ordering your second, maybe third round... You just can't control it. Even though I only eat the vegetarian dishes, I don't know what it is. But that is not a road I want to go down again... Not after...
About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Ganyu About Beidou.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_About_Beidou.ogg Recently, everyone in Yujing Terrace has been saying nasty things about the Crux Fleet. But in my personal opinion, Beidou's contribution to Liyue Harbor goes far beyond what those miserable rumor-loving heathens could even contemplate! ...Oops! I'm sorry, I... I'm not quite sure how that one slipped out...
About Yaoyao Friendship Lv. 4About Yaoyao Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Ganyu About Yaoyao.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_About_Yaoyao.ogg Yaoyao... Someone I know at the Ministry of Civil Affairs tasked me with keeping an eye on her in the city, making sure she doesn't try and sneak aboard the Crux... Oh, you want to know what the Ministry of Civil Affairs does? ...Who knows, am I right!? Heh... Who knows what they do? ...Not me...
About Xiao Friendship Lv. 4About Xiao Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Ganyu About Xiao.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_About_Xiao.ogg He seems like a bit of an outsider, socially. Probably just his personality... I can understand that, to be honest, but I'm not really about to try and get close to him. I mean... all the people he's ever agreed to team up with are no longer with us...
About Yanfei Friendship Lv. 4About Yanfei Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Ganyu About Yanfei.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_About_Yanfei.ogg Ah, Yanfei... Even back when she was an innocent little girl, she would tell me that "you have to keep your promises to live a happy life." Now, she's grown up to be a beautiful, graceful, and highly successful young woman. Although the work of a legal adviser is complicated, she always seems so carefree. This puts my mind at ease.
About Shenhe Friendship Lv. 4About Shenhe Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Ganyu About Shenhe.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_About_Shenhe.ogg I actually don't know her all that well — I've only heard bits and pieces from Cloud Retainer. From what I've heard, she can be quite ferocious. Whenever her temper gets the better of her, she is likely to start obliterating her surroundings. I wonder if she's just... bored. Should... Should I recommend some work to keep her occupied?
About Yelan Friendship Lv. 4About Yelan Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Ganyu About Yelan.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Ganyu_About_Yelan.ogg Even though Ms. Yelan is absent from work for the majority of the year, I'm sure Lady Ningguang must have her reasons for making exceptions for her. Of course, it wouldn't be my place to ask, so I don't know the details of their arrangement. I remember seeing her one day on my way back to Yuehai Pavilion, she was having breakfast with a group of people — they were all talking and laughing, eating, drinking tea... I must admit, I found myself feeling a little envious in that moment.

Oh, I mean, Ms. Xianyun — we went shopping together a while back, but we ended up stopping at every single stall, and she wanted to inspect every item they sold before we could leave. When we finally remembered to get something to eat, it was already dark out. It really reminded me of the time I used to spend training in the mountains with her... Back then, time also seemed to pass in the blink of an eye...

So if you really need to understand me more... This, uh, hairpiece... it's actually my horns. That's right. I'm part illuminated beast, qilin to be exact. Okay so, now we've got that out the way... Please sign this non-disclosure agreement for me. And don't tell a soul.

Still, all these years I've been asking myself the same question: Do I really belong in the human world? Maybe I'm just like a Dendro Slime hiding in the earth, burying myself in numbers and reports in order to escape reality.

I feel like I must have spoken more after meeting you than I have in the last ten years put together. If I keep going like this... Maybe one day I'll be able to move on to something other than secretarial work. Now that I've got a few hundred years of experience under my belt, I should be able to avoid any more major mistakes.

Media:vo ganyu mimitomo hello 01.ogg Ganyu: Hello, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo hello 02.ogg Ganyu: If you have any outstanding work, feel free to delegate to me.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Ganyu: I think it's beautiful here.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Ganyu: It must have been quite an undertaking to decorate such a large space. Thank you for all your efforts.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Ganyu: In my spare time, I particularly enjoy taking strolls outside. It's so quiet and peaceful.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Ganyu: Even at midday, it's perfectly safe to take a nap.
 Yes, you definitely don't need to worry about safety here...
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship1 05a.ogg Ganyu: Agreed! So I really do like it here.
 Take care to not catch a cold...
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship1 05b.ogg Ganyu: Please don't worry, I've slept like this every day for at least a thousand years.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Ganyu: Anyway, um... Thanks so much, once again!
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Ganyu: Sure... but I may not be able to offer any practical advice if our topic of discussion is not work-related.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Ganyu: Oh, a—alright...
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Ganyu: You know, I used to agonize a lot over whether to try and integrate into human society.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Ganyu: When our workload is light, my coworkers sometimes organize social events.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Ganyu: But my strict vegetarian diet is completely different from everyone else's. And I don't really share their interest in shopping or lively forms of entertainment.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Ganyu: Sometimes they can be quite critical... People say that my whole mindset is just fundamentally different from an ordinary person's...
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Ganyu: But what can I do? It's hard to change your habits when they've been that way for thousands of years...
 I'll think of a social activity that you would find easier to accept.
 I can go with you and help you slowly get accustomed.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Ganyu: Then it would only be proper for me to offer you something in return! Shall I take you out... for a meal? In a restaurant?
 We're friends, so there's no need for all that formality.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship2 09a.ogg Ganyu: Ahh... Okay... Duly noted!
 Sounds good, I'll take the opportunity to share more knowledge with you.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship2 09b.ogg Ganyu: ...Great, with your help, I'm sure I'll be able to integrate into human society in no time.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Ganyu: I thought maybe we could plant some flowers together. Or some other plants, like... vegetables...
 You must be good at gardening, huh?
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship3 02a 1.ogg Ganyu: Yes, indeed... You could say it's my greatest hobby... aside from work.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship3 02a 2.ogg Ganyu: Though in the past, I've been reluctant to grow vegetables... I always worried that I wouldn't be able to control my appetite and I'd end up eating them all in one sitting...
 I've never seen you grow vegetables before.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship3 02b.ogg Ganyu: That's because... I've always feared I wouldn't be able to control my appetite, and that I'd end up eating all the vegetables I grew in one sitting...
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Ganyu: But I'm sure that if I grow them together with you, I'll definitely be able to control myself!
 Even if you did eat them all, it wouldn't be such a big deal.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Ganyu: No, uh... you don't understand, I...
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Ganyu: I—I put on weight very easily, and...
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Ganyu: If my appearance changed, then perhaps... I—I mean, the way people see me — well, the way you see me...
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship3 07a 1.ogg Ganyu: Oh! Uh...
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship3 07a 2.ogg Ganyu: Still, I... I think it would be best to share them with you. You know, first rule of gardening — grow together, eat together!
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship3 07b.ogg Ganyu: Great! And, uh... you'll help me plant them too, right...? First rule of gardening — grow together, eat together!
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Ganyu: ...Anyway! I'll go, uh... fetch some seeds. I'll make sure they're the very best.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo morning 01.ogg Ganyu: Where are you off to today, is it far? My schedule is actually free right now.
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo morning 02.ogg Ganyu: Whether it's an ad-hoc assignment or any other task, I'm free to assist...
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo morning 03.ogg Ganyu: Oh...! I forgot to say... good morning, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo night 01.ogg Ganyu: Good night to you as well, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo ganyu mimitomo night 02.ogg Ganyu: For once, I don't need to work overtime at night... Huh... what a strange feeling...
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.
Media:vo mimitomo ly ganyu bedroom 01.ogg Ganyu: A big bed and soft pillow, appropriate lighting, and even a miniature tree for embellishment...
Media:vo mimitomo ly ganyu bedroom 02.ogg Ganyu: One can certainly rest well in a room like this.
Media:vo mimitomo ly ganyu bedroom 03.ogg Ganyu: I will try to finish all of my work before the sun comes up, and then... have a good sleep.
Media:vo mimitomo ly ganyu restaurant 01.ogg Ganyu: That smell... the fragrance of true Liyue cuisine.
Media:vo mimitomo ly ganyu restaurant 02.ogg Ganyu: Ahem... you must have put a lot of effort into finding these blueprints for Rain Calmer, yes?
Media:vo mimitomo ly ganyu restaurant 03.ogg Ganyu: Your liking for Liyue also signifies your approval of my work... Thank you.
