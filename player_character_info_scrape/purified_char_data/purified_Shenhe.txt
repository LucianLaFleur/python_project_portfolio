Released in Version 2.4[Create New History]
This Lantern Rite gift that Shenhe received is a set of elegant formal attire that her master, Cloud Retainer had commissioned for her. Red ropes still adorn her arms, but the bitter cold in Shenhe's heart has faded.
Frostflower Dew is a 4-Star Character Outfit for Shenhe. It is purchasable from the Character Outfit Shop.
During Version 4.4, Frostflower Dew was available at a limited-time discount of  Genesis Crystal ×1,350. In Version 4.5, its cost was increased to  Genesis Crystal ×1,680.
Shenhe's hair is parted off-center with one side covering her right eye. The back hair is fastened by teal ribbons in a loose fishtail braid ending in a super-low pony. A small odango bun is braided at her back head accessorized with a black hairpin.
Shenhe wears an black halterneck qipao dress with chest opening covered by black sheer fabric and full-length side slits fastend by flower frogs, revealing her white bustier underneath. She also wears two detached bubble sleeves with a ruffled shawl in a dark teal gradient. Her dress, bustier, and sleeves feature intricate patterns resembling snow lotus in dark sliver and gold accent. A metal garter is worn on her right thigh, where the Vision is affixied.
Her accessories consist red knots attaching to her sleeve garters and neck straps, a lotus headpiece, heart-shaped earrings, ombre nails, and simple black pumps with sliver anklets.
"All children love toys." This was the conclusion Shenhe came to after observing Granny Shan's toy store.
Kites, Xiao Lanterns, and window decorations made from cut colored paper... Children in Liyue could not help but stare fixedly at them as they passed.
And should the adults beside them cotton on to their desire and buy that toy for them, those children would smile.
Shenhe possessed no such childhood memories of the sort, so she could not understand their feelings in that moment from experience. But seeing how their eyes sparkled, she believed that these toys must be related to some wondrous emotion.
Though she had not figured out just what this emotion might be, this beautiful possibility did soften her heart a little.
"Shenhe seems very interested in toys." This was the conclusion Xianyun came to from observing Shenhe gazing at the toy store as if in a daze.
Her disciple, she knew, had lost her family when young, and had trained under her wing ever since, and thus opportunities to access toys had been few and far between.
Now that Shenhe had returned to live amongst humans, and she herself had taken their form to do so, she found as she grew more accustomed to the lives of mortals that Shenhe had indeed lacked many opportunities for joy compared to human children.
And was it not her responsibility as master and elder, she thought, to accompany her disciple for a jaunt at the toy store?
"Master seems very fond of toys," Shenhe reflected as she and her master Xianyun, at the latter's insistence, spoke to Granny Shan for the sixth time.
In truth, she did not quite understand the charm of these little window decorations or firecrackers.
Her master would often use sigils to create various colorful birds to decorate her abode. They were more vivid and lifelike than these decorations, and lovelier by far. And as for the crackling and popping of the firecrackers, they were quite crude compared to the adeptal melodies she was used to.
In truth, the toys themselves had but limited appeal to her, for what she actually liked was the smiles on the children's faces as they looked upon them.
But her master seemed very interested indeed, asking about all manner of details regarding the toys, from the crafting methods to the tricks behind releasing firecrackers. Finally, her master asked her what sort of toys she liked.
She believed that her master's interest must have some meaning behind it, and so she answered honestly. Then, she looked upon her master's calm, thoughtful, but silent face.
"Shenhe does not, in fact, like toys," Xianyun realized at last, after several visits to the toy stores.
If not, that gentle expression she saw on Shenhe's face as she stood in front of the toy store should have appeared at least once as she spoke with Granny Shan at length about the little imperfections in the latter's use of paper in window decorations, about improvements to firecracker casings to improve child safety, to the point she had completely earned the old lady's admiration.
What her disciple needed was perhaps not toys themselves.
A human's childhood and youth pass by in but the blink of an eye, and those who pass on shall never return. What, then, should she do as an elder?
Lantern Rite was fast approaching, and human custom dictated that festivals were a good opportunity to accept gifts. After all, had she not accepted just such from the Qixing in years prior...?
Shenhe did not realize her master's intent until she and Ganyu had received their Lantern Rite gifts from her.
She had felt no sense of regret about standing in front of the toy store, but her master's kindness was surprising all the same.
It was at that moment, when she took the long dress from the gift box her master handed to her and caressed its smooth hem that she understood how those children felt upon seeing those toys.
Both she and her master had changed much upon coming to the mortal realm — perhaps the future held still more pleasant surprises of this sort.
Her future would be full of opportunities to make up for all the laughter lost and joy she had missed out on in the past. She would keep all the warmth she received in her heart, to melt the ice within her bones.
These are heard when equipping the costume.

Fixes an issue with Shenhe whereby, after switching to the "Frostflower Dew" outfit, the in-game camera would abnormally shift slightly when unleashing her Elemental Burst.
OverviewLoreVoice-OversOutfitsCompanionGalleryEven though she was born in the human world, she ended up being an adepti disciple. She grew up in the mountains far away from Liyue Harbor, her soul bound with red ropes, training both her body and mind.
Despite having the elegant temperament of an adeptus, she seems to be shrouded in mystery.—Description from the Official Website[1]
An adepti disciple with a most unusual air about her. Having spent much time cultivating in isolation in Liyue's mountains, she has become every bit as cool and distant as the adepti themselves.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Originally part of the Tianheng Thaumaturges clan of exorcists, Shenhe originally had a happy life as a child until around the age of six, when her maddened father attempted to sacrifice her to a malevolent god in order to bring back his wife. While Shenhe managed to defeat the remnants of the god herself, the incident scarred her for life, giving her homicidal tendencies and causing her to believe herself to be a "cursed" child. Despite the adepti's attempts to contain her tendencies, they have only done so by binding her soul with Red Ropes, which suppress her emotions and cause her to have an indifferent personality.
Even with the red ropes suppressing her homicidal tendencies, Shenhe often contemplates the most violent means to eliminate others and is almost always easy to anger, obliterating her surroundings whenever her emotions get the best of her.[2] She throws hostile looks at Xingqiu, believing him to be threatening others.[3] Despite this, Shenhe ultimately wishes to fit in human society and places great trust in the Traveler.[4][5] She prefers speaking with a small number of people at a time.
As a result of living with the adepti, many of her fellow people worship her as one of them, something which deeply troubles her despite stating that she is just an adepti's disciple. She enjoys sampling small quantities of foods in a manner similar to Albedo. Due to having a limited diet in the mountains, Shenhe is used to eating plenty of herbs despite clearly despising their taste.

Shenhe uses the tall female model. She has a fair complexion, long hair that turns from silvery white at the roots to inky black at the ends, and pale, iridescent eyes with white pupils.
The mortal realm briefly gracing, like a wisp of smoke vanishing
One has traversed many realms and taken a great many pupils. Among them, Shenhe breaks the closest resemblance to oneself. Were she not a mortal, one would like to have her stay by my side.—Cloud Retainer
Shenhe comes from a branch family of a clan of exorcists. Due to certain reasons, Cloud Retainer took her in as a disciple.
To Shenhe, Cloud Retainer is a knowledgeable and chatty master.
To Cloud Retainer, Shenhe stands out as special from amongst the mortals she has instructed.
Living with adepti as a human is by no means an easy task, but Shenhe has a unique constitution, an immensely strong will, and a great talent for adepti arts, all of which have won her the acknowledgment of the adepti. However, the long years of cultivation, coupled with the habit of eating divine herbs and drinking the dew of the mountains, have made her more and more distant from earthly life, and she has even been regarded as a mysterious white-haired adeptus.
The occasional sharpness in her personality and the red ropes adorning her body add to her "mystery". If her past were to be written as a story, there would be multiple versions for sure.
Be it an immortal or a white-haired witch, how will people view this mysterious lady? Her secrets and feelings are as difficult to capture as the drifting clouds in the mountains.
Shenhe was originally from a branch family of exorcists, but due to a series of coincidences, she became the disciple of an adeptus.She is a student solely of Cloud Retainer in name, but her impressive constitution and intelligence quickly won several other adepti over.She would go on to learn from them all, eventually becoming a master of adeptal arts in her own right as a mortal.She very much looks the part as well in her unique temperament and manner of carrying herself — indeed, it would be no understatement to name her a true adeptus upon meeting her for the first time.However, it is precisely due to the long years of tutelage that she has lacked company save for the adepti and odd passing illuminated beast.This isolation has caused her to grow distant and indifferent.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Sometimes, a few rumors will escape from Liyue's small community of pilgrims to make the rounds in the city's back streets.These tales often depict someone being in a hopeless situation in some desperate place, when suddenly—A wandering white-haired adeptus comes to their rescue in the nick of time...Most such stories are a collection of lovely, intoxicating clichés, little different from the oft-told street-tales of fated marriages and the like.But if one were to ask that white-haired adeptus to tell the story, it would take a vastly different shape:"Some annoying creatures worm their way into the mountains from time to time. I simply get rid of them to prevent them from disturbing my master's meditations.""If some people did wind up getting caught in the crossfire and injured... Well, it was their decision to come here. There isn't much I can do about that."Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
Shenhe is in all likelihood the least accustomed to mortal life amongst those who take on an adeptal appearance.Having been sequestered in the mountains since a young age, she lacks experience and common sense, which makes it difficult for her to relate to people normally.To ordinary people, there are many solutions to any given problem. But to Shenhe, any solution that is not the simplest and most direct one may as well not exist.For example, she almost never considers "negotiation" as a solution to being at cross-purposes with others, mostly resorting to "threats" instead. After all, it is simple and efficacious. A good solution, no?She has also spent much time ruminating on problems that are truly esoteric.For example: Why do we need to pay for food?Is there any difference between intimidating civilians and intimidating bandits?She even truly believes that her master, Cloud Retainer, is a most brilliant and eloquent conversationalist.In a certain sense, she can be considered very pure.Much like a child, she relies on her chaotic yet straightforward intuition and logic to get her through life.Mountain Shaper once had this to say about her:"Little Shenhe is not only stronger than most — she also possesses a unique character.""She knows not the world, understands not common sense, distinguishes few cuisines, and acknowledges no hierarchies.""It may not be such an easy thing for Cloud Retainer to tutor her."Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4  •  The Crane Returns on the Wind
Liyue has no lack of folktales about meetings with the adepti, and many of these concern relative nobodies whom an adeptus took under their wing, thus elevating them greatly.However, the circumstances under which Shenhe's fate became tied to the adeptal abodes was no such glorious thing. If anything, it was an experience characterized by anguish.When she was five, her mother passed away, and her father, having loved his wife dearly, found that agony hard to bear.Over time, this agony turned into resentment, and this resentment birthed obsession, by which he was driven wandering throughout the land like a man gone mad.He left for close to a year, never stopping, never able to sleep soundly, ever searching for some technique that might bring his wife back.At last, when the year was almost out, he returned in joyous frenzy.Her father had brought with him a secret art known as "Fate Transference"—By making a ritual sacrifice to the seelie summoned by this art, a living person's body could be exchanged for a dead one's life.At that time, Shenhe was yet utterly unaware of the disaster that would befall. She was only an ordinary child, overjoyed at her long-absent father's return.He claimed that he had a surprise awaiting her in a cave in the mountains behind and that he would take her there immediately. She was ecstatic...But the scene that followed would be burned into her mind forever.Her father summoned that hideous, horrifying black "seelie" into that cave, its blood-red eyes craving her delectable life-force.Stupefied, Shenhe knew not from whence it had come, nor what it wanted from this place.Crises often paralyze people. One thought only, however, crept into the young Shenhe's mind.This creature wanted to eat her, but she did not want to die. She wanted to live!Gripping her mother's keepsake, an exorcism dagger, she faced that dark "seelie," trembling yet resolute...Several days later, an adeptus following the trail of great evil would investigate the cave, only to find the little girl collapsed inside — spent, famished, parched, her life hanging by a thread.Taking pity on the lass' ruinous fate, and seeing that she possessed great talent, having repelled some terrifying force on her own, the adeptus would bring her back, heal her, and instruct her in the adeptal path.If not for that, Shenhe would not be as she is today.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5  •  The Crane Returns on the Wind
Even the most diffident heart, cooled from living and training in the mountains for over a decade, might sometimes experience strange surges.So it was with Shenhe. On impulse, she came down from the mountains one night to return to what was once her home.She did not know how she felt about her home or her family. She was merely driven by some nebulous desire:To live in the house that was once hers, and to see what became of her father, lost in his obsession.She learned from neighbors that he had passed away several years prior only when she got there.Her childhood home had also been demolished by pawnbrokers — and thus had all the traces of her memory dissipated.She did not care about the attention she was attracting, and did not answer a single one of the questions asked by those in the vicinity.She simply stood there, listening to the howls that swept through the depths of her heart.Was it hatred? Mania? Relief?They were all there, and yet none tarried for even an instant. It was as if her heart were an old well without ripples.No, like a barren well with no water upon which there might be ripples.She stood there for a long time, before departing again before the astonished eyes of all.Each step was slow indeed, but she never once turned back.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6  •  The Crane Returns on the Wind
Liyue has its own fortune-telling, destiny-reading methods, similar to astrology.Of these, there are two fates that people seek to avoid at all costs.One is that of the "solitary star," which dictates that one will be separated from friends and family, living alone all one's days.The other is "disastrous evil," which means that one will face many hardships and perils.When the adepti rescued Shenhe, Moon Carver did once read her fortune.The signs showed that she was marked by both the "solitary star" and "disastrous evil," and that she was also plagued by intense homicidal urges — she was thus a person of supremely ominous destiny, doomed to harm both herself and others.To ensure that she could grow up safely and not harm any innocents, the adepti bound her soul using red ropes.This binding had the effect of restraining both her evil fate and her violent tendencies, but also shackled many emotions that should have originally belonged to a human.From then on, she became more and more disaffected by trivial matters, and even things most might consider important were but dust to her.She became ever less human, and ever more like a lovely yet cold statue.But surprisingly, she felt something stir within her when she encountered that Traveler from a distant land:Long-dormant emotions, now strangers to her, came loose all at once from the depths of fate's tableau.Perhaps it really was as Moon Carver once said: that heaven might dictate fates, but destiny's tale is written by mortals. The tale of Shenhe and the mortal world had not yet ended...White Jade Comb Friendship Lv. 4  •  The Crane Returns on the Wind
Once upon a time, Shenhe had a full head of black hair.When she was first brought to Mt. Hulao, she would not say a word. The only thing she proved willing to do was to climb the mountain and watch the sea of clouds.It was well, however, that she would sleep when tired, drink the dew of the mountains when thirsty, and would chew on a few stalks of Qingxin when hungry.Cloud Retainer took this all in, but did not disturb the girl, instead making this comb of white jade from a sacred stone and giving it to her.The adeptus said that if she ever wished to sever her ties with the mortal world and enter adeptal tutelage, she should brush her hair thrice with this comb, and it would be counted as a rite of apprenticeship.Shenhe did exactly as the adeptus said without any hesitation. And something strange happened then — for as the jade comb brushed through Shenhe's hair once, a layer of her black locks turned a frosty silver from root to tip.On the second brush, but half her hair remained dark.When the process was complete, only a flowing curtain of snow remained....Today, Shenhe still keeps this comb on her person as a symbol of her connection to the adepti.Through her years of training, she has long since come to understand the meaning behind those three brush strokes:The first to uproot useless anxiety, the second to forsake joy and sorrow, and the third to walk this path into old age without regret.Vision Friendship Lv. 6  •  The Crane Returns on the Wind
Few people know how the young girl in the cave, intended as a sacrifice by her own father, had been able to stand against the monster for days and nights on end by herself.Though Shenhe was born into an exorcist family, her maddened father had not taught her a single thing about exorcism.And like many at that innocent age, she was also wholly unused to facing life's perils alone.But in that aphotic cave, bereft of parental protection — indeed, betrayed by kin — Shenhe underwent a metamorphosis.Just as Moon Carver's readings had shown, the sleeping calamitous fates, violent urges, and unyielding spirit within her burst their bonds all at once.Those things served as an unseen shield and invisible blade, arming the girl's frail form.They gave her strength, gave her claws and fangs, allowing her to attack that wretched creature before her, to swear to tear it to shreds — to prove that she, and not it, was the cruelest evil that stalked the darkness.Their life-and-death battle across the next few days was one without end. Hunter and hunted switched places many times, the conflict locked in stalemate...As the shadow of death loomed large, the gods looked upon the extraordinary girl with favor.With the bright, crystalline object falling into Shenhe's hands, the balance tipped irrevocably in her favor and the victor was decided.The vivid icy light pierced through the dark like skyglow, showing the path to the future.In the past, it had guided Shenhe from her miserable fate. In the future, it would also lead her back to the mortal realm.
Obtain:Reward for reaching Friendship Level 10 with ShenheDescription:The early onset of white hair is often correlated to one's sorrows. Since "comb" and "scatter" are similarly read in Liyue's language, they believe that combing one's hair is the same as scattering one's misfortunes.

The English version refers to Shenhe's murderous tendencies as homicidal, however in the Chinese translation, it refers more broadly to a murderous intent towards one's self as well as others. This is clarified in her Story 5.
Shenhe's hair changing from black to white taken to mean "combing away worries" is ironic, in the sense that usually the early onset of white hair means that one is full of worries. This irony is also highlighted in her namecard's description.
Chongyun refers to Shenhe as his "aunt". Based on their voice-overs, they are blood-related and hail from the same clan, although the English translation does not indicate which side of the family they are related by.[6]
In the Chinese translation, Chongyun calls Shenhe 小姨 xiǎoyí, which specifically refers to "aunt" as the youngest sister/female cousin of the speaker's mother. This would mean that Shenhe is Chongyun's maternal aunt. Shenhe was not mentioned to have any siblings, meaning that she is likely a cousin of Chongyun's mother.
According to Records of a Changing Village, a branch family of exorcists used to live in the east of the village. However, the mother would die of illness, the young daughter would go missing, and shortly after, the father would hang himself on a tree in the yard of his own house. The young daughter of this family is implied to be Shenhe.
Although Shenhe's stories clearly state that she did not learn any exorcist arts from her family, she is able to use techniques similar to exorcist arts. Chongyun refers to Shenhe as "an adept exorcist" upon witnessing her abilities. Although there is no clear explanation, it is possible that the adeptal arts which were taught to Shenhe by Cloud Retainer are related to exorcist techniques (the latter might have descended from the former).
Shenhe is quite willing to help Chongyun in his training should he make the effort to go see her in the mountains.
Shenhe is seen wielding Calamity Queller in her official art.
Shenhe is one of four 5-star characters who have not yet received a Story Quest, the other being Keqing, Qiqi, and the Wanderer.
Out of the four, Shenhe and the Wanderer are the only event-exclusive characters.
Shenhe is known by these aliases or titles:
Shenhe and Xianyun share the same Chinese voice actress, Qin Ziyi (秦紫翼).
申鹤 Shēnhè means "immortal crane," using an old meaning of the word 申. In the past, the word 申 shēn meant "immortal" in the sense of Taoist xian, also known as Chinese immortals, whom the adepti are modeled after. However, the word 神 shén has now replaced it to describe "divinity" (lit: "god"), while 申 no longer has a standalone meaning. The use of 申 rather than 神 in her name could be a play on her being close to (or mistaken as one of) the adepti, but not being an adeptus herself.
It may be also intended to be a synonym for 仙鹤 xiānhè, lit. "crane of xian (immortals, adepti)," a poetic name for the red-crowned crane in Mandarin. The red-crowned crane is regarded as one of the most beautiful and sacred birds in the Chinese culture and considered to be a riding animal of xian. The red accent color of Shenhe's attire may be inspired by the color pattern of this crane.
Shenhe's constellation in Chinese 愁疏座 "Scattering of Worries" contains the play of the words "comb" and "scatter" found in her namecard's description.

I was born fated to bear the curse of calamity, so I am prone to bring harm to the people around me. The adepti urged me to bind my soul with red ropes to keep my homicidal nature at bay. If you are able to walk alongside me without fear... Hah, very well. Now, give me your hand.

That's why I loathe crowded areas.
When It RainsWhen It RainsMedia:VO_Shenhe When It Rains.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_When_It_Rains.ogg In the mortal world, at times likes these, is it not customary to... use an umbrella?

When Thunder StrikesWhen Thunder StrikesMedia:VO_Shenhe When Thunder Strikes.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_When_Thunder_Strikes.ogg In this weather, I can freeze monsters in place and simply let the lightning bolts take care of the rest. A good way to not get my clothes dirty.

About Shenhe: InstinctAbout Shenhe: InstinctMedia:VO_Shenhe About Shenhe - Instinct.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_About_Shenhe_-_Instinct.ogg For all the training I've had — honing my body and mind, learning the adepti arts — I've mostly been guided by my own instincts. It just comes down to self-preservation. I'm not trying to save the world, so if I wipe out some evil presence and it happens to benefit you, don't thank me. It's just a force of habit.
About Shenhe: Different Friendship Lv. 4About Shenhe: Different Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Shenhe About Shenhe - Different.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_About_Shenhe_-_Different.ogg If I treat people kindly, they call me an adeptus, and if I put them in their place, they call me a witch. Heh... The one thing you'll never hear them call me is "human." They all seem to agree that I'm fundamentally... different from them.
About Us: MannersAbout Us: MannersMedia:VO_Shenhe About Us - Manners.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_About_Us_-_Manners.ogg I rarely leave the mountains, so I was never taught proper manners. When a conflict arises, I just take care of it the way that comes naturally to me. But if you don't approve of my methods, please do let me know. Even if I don't fully understand your reasoning, I will always defer to you.

But during our journey together, I feel I have finally grasped the key to all of this. Somehow, controlling my strength — knowing when to restrain myself, and when to unleash — it comes more naturally to me now. I think that what saves me from myself is not my red ropes... but you. If you understand what that means to me, please stay by my side.
About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Shenhe About the Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_About_the_Vision.ogg So this shiny gemstone is called a "Vision"? Heh... the gifts that fate brings, fate can just easily take away. If one day my connection to this Vision comes to an end, that'll be it, and the light inside of it will go out.
Something to ShareSomething to ShareMedia:VO_Shenhe Something to Share.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_Something_to_Share.ogg Driving evil spirits away comes easily to me. Getting rid of my inner demons, however... Unless you can find a way to let go, all the adepti arts and exorcism techniques in the world can't save you.
Interesting ThingsInteresting ThingsMedia:VO_Shenhe Interesting Things.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_Interesting_Things.ogg Why do I always hear people say, "The first snow of the season is a sight for sore eyes"? We have snow every single day in the mountains. So which instance counts as the "first snow"? I don't understand what they mean. Please explain this to me.
About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Shenhe About Ningguang.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_About_Ningguang.ogg I have no use for the wealth that ordinary people desire. But in the hands of Lady Ningguang, wealth becomes a means of solving complex issues of the kind that no weapons could ever hope to resolve. She understands the unwritten rules of human society, she knows what's in people's hearts... Master once told me that even the adepti aren't able to achieve this. I hold her and her work in high regard.
About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Shenhe About Beidou.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_About_Beidou.ogg I find I don't need to worry about etiquette with her, and unlike with some people, I don't need to rely on non-verbal cues to discern the true meaning of what she's saying. That makes me a lot more comfortable. The only problem is... Well, there are too many people around her all the time, and I heard there's also many crew members on her ship... I need you to go with me. It's the only way I can cope with so many people.
About Yun Jin Friendship Lv. 4About Yun Jin Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Shenhe About Yun Jin.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_About_Yun_Jin.ogg Yun Jin performs... It's called "Liyue opera," isn't it? I like this particular type of social interaction. You can get to know about the other person's background without having to actually interact with them one on one. If she ever includes your story in one of her performances, I'm sure the result will end up being quite incredible. I'm looking forward to it.
About Ganyu Friendship Lv. 4About Ganyu Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Shenhe About Ganyu.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_About_Ganyu.ogg I've heard many stories about her from my master. She's really quite different from how I originally imagined her... But don't worry, I'll be keeping this to myself. Speaking of Ganyu, her work in Liyue Harbor is unbelievably busy... It seems that there is a price to pay for those who want to integrate into the mortal world.
About Chongyun Friendship Lv. 4About Chongyun Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Shenhe About Chongyun.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_About_Chongyun.ogg It's hard for me to believe that... I still have living relatives in this world. If he has any difficulties with his training, I am more than willing to help enlighten him. However, he will need to meet me alone in the mountains. Their family is too... sociable. I wouldn't know how to turn down their invitations without being impolite.

If he dares threaten you, I will make sure he... Hmm? You mean it's just an in-joke between friends? Genuinely...?
About Zhongli Friendship Lv. 4About Zhongli Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Shenhe About Zhongli.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_About_Zhongli.ogg That gentleman claims to be a mortal, yet is very familiar with my master, who is an adeptus. Master once said: "If you see him drinking on a stone stool in front of my abode, do not disturb him. Let him sit quietly for a while." And that's precisely what I did.
About Baizhu Friendship Lv. 4About Baizhu Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Shenhe About Baizhu.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_About_Baizhu.ogg The quality of his medicinal herbs is as good as it gets, he is also easy-going and considerate of others. By comparison, the little snake on his neck has no filter at all... Haha, don't worry, I didn't lift a finger against it, I won't go as far as getting into a quarrel with a snake.
About Hu Tao Friendship Lv. 4About Hu Tao Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Shenhe About Hu Tao.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_About_Hu_Tao.ogg I often see her wandering in the woods singing strange songs. Actually, I must have heard all of her songs several times each by now. I'm used to her singing, but I still find it strange. That being said, I don't hate it either.
About Xiao Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star ApproachesAbout Xiao Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star ApproachesMedia:VO_Shenhe About Xiao.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_About_Xiao.ogg My first impression of him was that he's not one to smile. After meeting him again more recently, however, he's still as reserved as ever, but... he seems a lot more relaxed now. Maybe he... met someone special.

It gave me pause for thought... I grew up under Master's care, too. Is it possible that I have subconsciously picked up a thing or two from her as well...?
More About Shenhe: IMore About Shenhe: IMedia:VO_Shenhe More About Shenhe - 01.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_More_About_Shenhe_-_01.ogg Please don't pay any heed to the way most people refer to me. I am not an adeptus, and don't possess any divine abilities. I was born in a branch family of a clan of exorcists, and grew up in the mountains far away from Liyue Harbor. I am but an adeptus's disciple, nothing more, nothing less.

This course of action perplexes me. Removing the root of the problem and disposing of these ill-intentioned fools seems like the obvious course of action. Why do common folks prefer the labor-intensive route?

After a certain point, however, they stopped teaching me new techniques and started focusing on how to control my intense homicidal urges. Oh, don't be nervous... Yes, craters have been left in the ground, and giant trees have been uprooted. But these things only ever happen in the mountains, far away from civilization, and certainly have never affected innocent lives. Besides, I can control myself now.

After he abandoned me in that cave, I still held out hope that he'd come back to rescue me. One day went by. Then two days, three days... I used every ounce of energy in my body to fight off that monster. But as I collapsed on the ground, I finally realized that the day I was waiting for would never come. To this day, I don't which one it is... Was I abandoned because I'm cursed, or is it the way I've been treated in life that has cursed me?

But it was deserted, and my father had long since passed away. I suddenly realized that the bond between my relatives and I had been completely severed. And nothing that I'd ever cared about in the past could ever have a future. Ever since then, I have abandoned everything related to the mortal world... That is, until I met you.
Shenhe's HobbiesShenhe's HobbiesMedia:VO_Shenhe Hobbies.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_Hobbies.ogg The most important aspect of meditation is stillness. Let go of all agitation, and let the air around you flow into your body. This technique allows me to quickly focus in on myself. I heard from my master that after meditating beyond a certain point, there is no need to adopt the meditation posture anymore. Adepti can meditate even when standing up... I still have much more to improve on.
Shenhe's Troubles Friendship Lv. 6Shenhe's Troubles Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Shenhe Troubles.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_Troubles.ogg The fear of losing the people most important to me, and the desire to save them... This kind of feeling makes my heart ache, I've never experienced anything like it before. It's a burden, yes, but it's also... something to hold onto.
Favorite FoodFavorite FoodMedia:VO_Shenhe Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_Favorite_Food.ogg I've sampled numerous dishes during my time away from the mountains, but the truth is that I don't really remember how they taste. The only dish I can never forget the flavor of is that bowl of noodles I ate at home, so long ago... I shouldn't have to remember that. Why do I have to remember that?
Least Favorite FoodLeast Favorite FoodMedia:VO_Shenhe Least Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Shenhe_Least_Favorite_Food.ogg Chew medicinal herbs for long enough, and you can only taste the bitterness... In all the years I trained under the adepti, I had to abstain from all kinds of things, and to a point, I got used to it. But them... "The common delights of the mortal realm pose no hindrance to the adepti, thus, we may indulge in all manner of dishes as we please"... These are the exact words my master said.

They give presents to celebrate the anniversary of the other person's birth. Material possessions aren't really my thing, but... The view of the starry night sky in the mountains is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. I've frozen this lake and turned it into a mirror, so you can appreciate the reflection of the fleeting clouds and distant stars right up close. This is my way of celebrating your birthday... Hope you like it.

Media:vo shenhe mimitomo hello 01.ogg Shenhe: Welcome home, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), it's great to have you back.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo hello 02.ogg Shenhe: Um, I heard that I should say these sorts of things whenever family returns home.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Shenhe: To be honest, I had originally expected this place to be like an adeptus's abode...
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Shenhe: I never suspected that your design would differ so greatly from what I had imagined.
 If you had to pick, would you prefer an adeptus's abode or here?
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Shenhe: Hmm, most adepti spend their years wandering the outside world. Though their abodes can be uniquely picturesque, they also feel like a lonely and remote paradise.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Shenhe: But here feels very warm and cozy, and I have a nice person like you to keep me company. I've truly never experienced anything like this.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Shenhe: What I mean is... I like it here. I will cherish this place and learn to adapt to life here.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Shenhe: However... there are many pieces of decoration and furniture here that I've never seen before. I'm uncertain of their use or purpose.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship1 07.ogg Shenhe: So please take a moment to explain everything to me when you could spare the time.
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Shenhe: Chat? Then I suppose you must enjoy chatting, just like my master.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Shenhe: Alright then, aside from my rigorous training in the adepti arts, my master also taught me the skills of conversation. Though more often than not, she was the only one speaking and I ended up just listening quietly.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Shenhe: I suppose I should take the opportunity to practice whenever it presents itself. Why don't you start?
 What have you learned about making conversation?
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Shenhe: Well... It seems that conversation is a skill that can't be practiced like other arts. There isn't any concrete methodology to mastering it as far as I can tell.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Shenhe: I only remember my master saying that the purpose of talking is not only to convey information, but also to direct the mood and deepen mutual feelings.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 06a 1.ogg Shenhe: Well, according to her, you should pick topics of interest to your partner. That's the best way to direct the mood of the conversation.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 06a 2.ogg Shenhe: Before I met you, I wasn't close with anyone. There were barely any topics that would ever spark my interest.
 How do you deepen mutual feelings?
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 06b 1.ogg Shenhe: I'm quite ashamed, actually, I have no talent for this and my master's expertise hasn't rubbed off on me at all...
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 06b 2.ogg Shenhe: The feelings shared between my adepti teachers and me are quite extraordinary. We don't need to converse to deepen our feelings for each other.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 06b 3.ogg Shenhe: And besides them, I have no real friends, which means that I've never had someone with whom to deepen my feelings.
 You don't seem like you enjoy chatting at all...
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Shenhe: Well, whenever my master brought you up as the topic, I'll admit I felt quite... amused.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Shenhe: Yes, you. She said that you are widely regarded as a bold and fearless hero, but if people had seen the look of sheer panic on your face when you fell from the first Jade Chamber...
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Shenhe: You're blushing. Is this how it feels when the mood of a conversation begins to shift?
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Shenhe: It seems my master's conversation techniques are quite handy after all...
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 11.ogg Shenhe: I've got it, I shall go ask my master all about you. That way, we'll have many more common topics to discuss.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 12.ogg Shenhe: Oh, I suppose there's no need to go through all that trouble, you're already sitting right here in front of me after all.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship2 13.ogg Shenhe: In which case, please, tell me more about yourself. I'll remember everything you say!
 Is there anything you'd like to do?
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Shenhe: As a matter of fact, I would like something to eat.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Shenhe: Well, no. Not really. I actually just wanted to sit and chat with you over a long meal.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Shenhe: I heard that sharing a meal is really important to the people of Liyue.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Shenhe: It's not only about eating, but rather, "sharing an enjoyable time with those that are important to you."
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Shenhe: When everyone gathers together over a meal, that's called a "get-together," right?
 That's right, especially during the holidays.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Shenhe: Like Lantern Rite? I know that everyone is supposed to release Xiao Lanterns during that holiday... a pity that it's only once a year.
 There are other holidays, too, you know...
 For example, the Moonchase Festival. Everyone gathers to enjoy the moonlight together.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Shenhe: I see...
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Shenhe: I used to always feel that the holidays had nothing to do with me. But now... there seems to be a longing in my heart for the next holiday to come more quickly.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Shenhe: I would like to use all that I have learned to celebrate together with you.
 I almost didn't realize it, but...
 You've made loads of progress...
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Shenhe: I've been growing thanks to your constant guidance. Believe me, I won't forget your kindness.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Shenhe: And my feelings toward you are not only of gratitude...
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Shenhe: But anyway, let's celebrate the next holiday together!
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo friendship3 13.ogg Shenhe: Yes, a big get-together.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo morning 01.ogg Shenhe: Oh, up already, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo morning 02.ogg Shenhe: If those noisy birds woke you up, I'll go silence them right away.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo morning 03.ogg Shenhe: Huh? Oh, you don't want me to harm them? Fine... I'll just shoo them away. Don't worry.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo night 01.ogg Shenhe: Good night, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), have a nice rest.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo night 02.ogg Shenhe: If you find yourself tossing and turning, I have some herbs to calm the spirit and help you sleep. Just let me know if you need them.
Media:vo shenhe mimitomo night 03.ogg Shenhe: Even if it's late, I promise it won't be trouble for me at all. So please don't hesitate.
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.
Media:vo mimitomo md shenhe store 01.ogg Shenhe: If we were in Liyue Harbor, this street would be crammed with people... and I don't think I'd stay longer than I needed to.
Media:vo mimitomo md shenhe store 02.ogg Shenhe: But here, this street seems like such a safe place...
Media:vo mimitomo md shenhe store 03.ogg Shenhe: Join me for a walk. It could be good practice for you, helping me acclimatize to the mortal world.
Media:vo mimitomo md shenhe village 01.ogg Shenhe: I much prefer tranquil places like this to the constant clamor of the city.
Media:vo mimitomo md shenhe village 02.ogg Shenhe: It's somewhere that I can be myself. No distractions.
Media:vo mimitomo md shenhe village 03.ogg Shenhe: A life of freedom, leisure, and relative privacy... It seems this appeals to you, too.
