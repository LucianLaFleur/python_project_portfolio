Character Outfit ShopEchoing Tales Event (Previously)
Summertime Sparkle is a 4-Star Character Outfit for Barbara. It is purchasable from the Character Outfit Shop.
During Version 1.6, Summertime Sparkle was obtainable for free as a reward from the Echoing Tales event, in which players had to collect 24 Echoing Conches scattered throughout the Golden Apple Archipelago.

Barbara wears her hair in two high pigtails that spiral downward.
She sports a white sailor-inspired cardigan over a dark blue one-piece swimsuit. Her Vision is worn on a clip on her back. The look is completed with accessories consisting of a yellow duck bag, a small beret, a pendant choker, a garter on the left thigh, and blue and white T-strap sandals, all of which display white floral ornamental details.
Barbara's songs and dances are meant to heal everyone's hearts.
But sometimes, even Barbara, who brings smiles onto everyone's faces, will herself feel down.
She, too, wishes to hang out with close friends and spend quality time with her family, much like any other girl her age.
These small wishes seem simple to anyone else, but they are a luxury for Barbara.
As an idol, she is often surrounded by zealous fans when she goes out.
And when she can steal moments to be with her family, the time she can spend with her parents and sister is ever so brief.
Her brilliant, busy sister is often stuck to her desk due to official business, and every time Barbara wants to go to her to share her feelings, she is silenced by the mountain of work piled in front of Jean.
Her sister's exhaustion is plain to see, and Barbara sees it too.
It can't be helped: Jean Gunnhildr is everyone's Acting Grand Master.
"But... could you just... give me my sister back, just for a while?"
Barbara says this to herself while watching her busy sister.
And that was when she heard a rumor about a strange archipelago.
Summer, islands, the ocean... could this be her hard-come-by opportunity?
Summer meant refreshing drinks, sweet icy desserts, and golden sands, azure seas, and people playing in the water.
The sand... the sea... Yes! So it was decided.
But a seaside trip requires preparation.
Snacks, sweets... ah yes, and Spicy Dried Fish, too. All this, she placed into her cute yellow ducky bag. ♪
Oh, and let's not forget clothes! I'll need some light and comfy swimwear. This short skirt looks good — and those little white flowers lend a playful look to those shoes! ♪
And perhaps a little bow tied around the neckline, would that look cuter?
Barbara began to hum happily to herself: La~ la la la la~ la la! ♪
But there was no way her sister would have time to prepare any swimwear for herself, would she?
That was quite the pickle... Still, there were ways around that.
Barbara pushed the door of the library open with a smile. "Do you have time, Miss Lisa? I'd like your help with picking a set of clothes."
These are heard when equipping the costume.

OverviewLoreVoice-OversOutfitsCompanionGallery
The Deaconess of the Favonius Church and a shining starlet adored by all. Although the concept of a starlet is rather novel in a city of bards, the people of Mondstadt love Barbara nonetheless. "I owe everything to the city's spirit of freedom" — Barbara, regarding her popularity.—Description from the Official Website[1]
Every citizen of Mondstadt adores Barbara. However, she learned the word "idol" from a magazine.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
The Deaconess of the Church of Favonius, Barbara. She's hardworking, bright, charismatic, and optimistic, yet may be clumsy sometimes. The sight of the Idol of Mondstadt makes everyone have something of a "second wind" and become motivated.
Even after being a successful figure in Mondstadt, she feels doubt and feels disillusioned whenever thinking of the duration of one's smile on other's faces after hearing her song. Her desire for fame and recognition changed into the desire to help others in times of need. Though depressed, she cheers herself back up, not letting herself be down or depressed for 30 seconds.
She feels inferior to her "big sister" Jean, thinking everything she's done is of inferior nature to the Acting Grand Master and strives to do something that surpasses Jean's deeds at least once. She's the deaconess of the church, meaning she safeguards religious artifacts and worships Barbatos, although obliviously unaware that she has met him.

Barbara uses the medium female model. She has ash blonde hair, gray-blue eyes, and fair skin.
I just want to see Barbara to make my day a bit brighter!"—The usual excuse of those accused by the nuns of loitering around the cathedral doors.[2]
▌Deaconess of the Knights of Favonius · Barbara
Barbara, the Deaconess of the Knights of Favonius, is a shining starlet beloved by the people of Mondstadt.
Her Hydro power is the best remedy for a wound, just like her soothing singing and dancing is solace to a weary heart.
The people of Mondstadt all think Barbara has some kind of magical power that can heal both the wounds and the heart, but only Barbara herself knows that the secret of such magic is diligence.
Barbara is the Deaconess of the Church of Favonius, as well as the shining idol of Mondstadt."The sight of Barbara makes all my problems disappear." This is quite a common saying among the citizens of Mondstadt.In fact, Barbara can do much more than just put people in a better mood: Her healing powers extend to flesh wounds and other physical ailments.Barbara is known to have access to miraculous healing powers through her Hydro Vision.However, Barbara herself knows that hard work is the most miraculous magic of all.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Every citizen of Mondstadt adores Barbara.However, this has not always been the case. At first, Barbara's songs sounded strange to the citizens of Mondstadt, and many struggled to see the appeal.This was because for the longest time, the folk songs of bards were the only popular songs known in Mondstadt.Fortunately, Mondstadt stayed true to its reputation as the City of Freedom, and the people ultimately embraced the new while continuing to cherish the old.People accepted Barbara's songs, and over time her positive energy rubbed off on them. Soon, they could be heard humming her tunes all around Mondstadt."Albert, would you stop please! You're completely out of tune!"Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
Barbara's feelings on her own success are mixed.To the extent that an idol's duty is to make everyone adore her, she has done a fantastic job.There is no doubting that she has made the right choice.However, an idol is also expected to spread joy and relieve people's spiritual fatigue... Has she really accomplished that?She sang for blind Glory, encouraging her to believe that her lover would one day return. She sang, too, for sick Anna, promising her that her illness would one day be cured.Yet, the smiles on their faces never last long after the songs end.This has led Barbara to become somewhat disillusioned and doubtful.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Barbara has always been a bright and optimistic girl since she was young. Though at times she can be a bit clumsy and mess things up, she always bounces right back and has another go.Barbara is the complete opposite of her sister, who is seen by all as the pride of her family.Unlike Barbara, her sister has always been the very definition of success in all aspects.Initially, all Barbara had ever wanted was to surpass her sister in at least one thing, even if only once.However, be it swordplay, her grades, or anything else, she was never able to compare.Even for someone as optimistic as her, she found herself to be upset and down."Hard work is the most miraculous magic. But when even that doesn't work... what then?"Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Barbara has never once considered giving up.Her determination and resilience even surprised her father, Seamus Pegg, the Cardinal of Daybreak.Barbara only allows herself to be depressed for 30 seconds.After that, she forces herself to brighten up, no matter what."I'm not so good in combat, so I'll be sure to support those who are."Under her father's counsel, Barbara became a healer.She is as radiant as the sick and injured are pained.Her desire to be recognized gradually transformed into a simple desire to help others.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
"Thank you" are the two words that Barbara hears most often.When she feels lost, she will suddenly find that there is someone wanting to hold her hand."Thanks for being here with me. I feel so much better."To Barbara, the greatest reward is seeing the smiles on people's faces.Therefore, whenever she is massaging her swollen calves or drinking tea to care for her sore throat, Barbara recalls all those who have been kind to her."It's the encouragement I receive from others that keeps me going."Just maybe, the smiles she receives are proof that her songs really can heal people.Her ambition to surpass her sister and become the most popular person in all of Mondstadt hasn't been abandoned by Barbara, it is simply buried deep inside her heart."If only I excelled more, perhaps I could be of help to Jean."This is what she believes."Okay... Barbara, go!"Alice's Idol Magazine Friendship Lv. 4
"...Idol?"The first time that Barbara heard this strange word, she was visibly confused."But... aren't The Seven the ones that people are supposed to worship?""Yes, but not exclusively..." replied Alice, an elder of the Hexenzirkel, as she groomed the young girl for stardom. "Read this, it contains everything you will need to know.""Idol Magazine" was the name of the assigned reading material. Barbara had no idea what world this magazine had come from, but by reading it she found out that there was indeed such thing as an "idol," and that it mainly involved working hard at getting everyone to like you.She also discovered that an outstanding idol is capable of not just bringing joy to themselves, but also bringing spiritual healing to others through the power of song and dance.Barbara set about learning one new song after another, dancing to the beat as she went. Finally, she found happiness, and she found it in the smiling faces of others.Some time later, when Alice anxiously relayed to Barbara that plans for "Teyvat Idols!" were falling through, Barbara was starting to make a name for herself through her performances in Mondstadt."Hmm... Well, if I'm the only one left... I guess you can leave it to me to define what it really means to be an idol!"Driven by this ever so slightly selfish ambition to spread joy and healing to others, Barbara is slyly swotting up on new tunes behind the scenes to this very day.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
The story of how Barbara obtained her Vision is hardly the typical tale of high-stakes heroism.She had just joined the church and was looking after a little boy with a high and persisting fever.Nothing Barbara could think of would console the boy and bring an end to his relentless tears.Someone remarked that while the boy had already taken his medicine, there was no way to cure the pain of missing one's family.Another suggested that Barbara sing a song for the boy to raise his spirits.Barbara had never sung a song in her life up until this point, but how could she shy away from it in a moment like this?"Never having sung before is no reason to abandon a child in their time of need," Barbara thought to herself.And so, Barbara took the boy in her arms and sang him a song: a lullaby, the only song she knew.It was an unceremonious beginning to her singing career. After quickly realizing that she barely knew any of the words, she had to resort to humming the tune instead.Nevertheless, her voice began to soothe the child, and so she kept singing. She sang the same song, over and over again, until her throat was dry and her voice was hoarse. Finally, the boy fell asleep. Exhausted, Barbara lay down by the wall and fell straight asleep herself.Early the next morning, Barbara awoke to discover that the boy's fever had come down. Perhaps it was because she had sung for him, or perhaps it had something to do with the Vision which had mysteriously appeared next to her hand at some point during the night.Barbara was not preoccupied with the Vision, however. It was the sight of the boy smiling once again that filled her heart with joy.Barbara received her Vision for the simple but beautiful wish that took hold in her heart that night: A dream of healing the sick through the power of song.
Obtain:Reward for reaching Friendship Level 10 with BarbaraDescription:When Barbara sings, her melodic voice flows like the tender healing of a clear spring.

My Wish... (2021-07-05)My Secret Tip... (2022-07-05)The Power of an Idol... (2023-07-05)A Song... (2024-07-05)
The tune that Barbara hums in her idle in English, Chinese, and Japanese appears in other media pertaining to her. (The Korean version has a different tune entirely.) All appearances so far, including in Barbara's idles, appear to be in C major.
The tune appears on the music staff on Barbara's wish art. However, the lowest note is likely missing a ledger line. In addition, the highest note (C-flat, the enharmonic equivalent of B) does not appear in any other version of the tune; all other versions use B-flat or C. Due to the presence of the flat, it is likely that the highest note on the staff is intended to be B-flat.
The assets for the staff and the notes, including the joined sixteenth and eighth notes and the highest note with a flat, are reused in all three parts of Barbara: Flow, but without denoting any tune.
The tune is featured throughout the Version 1.4 "Invitation of Windblume" Trailer as well as the music when Barbara is shown in the final cinematic of Invitation of Windblume, "Floral Breeze" - Scenes from Windblume Festival (0:52 to 0:59).
Notably, the tune in the trailer and cinematic has a minor seventh between the last two notes like in the Chinese version of Barbara's idle, instead of an octave like in the English version of Barbara's idle, with the exception of the final tune at the end of the first half of the trailer, which ends with an octave like the English version. (The Japanese version of Barbara's idle does not finish the tune.)
The rhythm in the trailer and cinematic has swung notes like in the English version of Barbara's idle, instead of straight notes like in the Chinese version of Barbara's idle.
Barbara is currently the only four-star character that has a close-up cut-in when using her Elemental Burst, much like five-star characters.
Barbara's favorite food is spicy dried fish, while her least favorite foods are anything bitter.
Barbara's love for spicy food is renowned throughout Mondstadt — though, according to Vile, Jueyun Chilis from Liyue would be spicy enough to make even her cry.
Barbara shares her English voice actress, Laura Stahl, with Xinyan.
Other similarities they share are a love for spicy food, as well as being musicians who have amassed their own fanbases despite performing songs that defied their countries' traditional forms of music.
Barbara shares her Korean voice actress, Yun A-yeong, with Xiangling.
Barbara was one of the first two characters to get a themed outfit, the other being Jean.
Barbara is mentioned in the descriptions of the following 4 Furnishings: Alchemic Component: Burden of Dust Dodoco's Travel Bag Shop Ornament: Birdie the Waiter Fully Furnished Mondstadt Bedroom
The given name Barbara is derived from the Latin word barbarus, meaning "foreign, strange." The Latin word barbara pertains to "a wild, savage, cruel, barbarous, shameless, or immodest woman."
Her name may also allude to Saint Barbara.
Barbara's constellation, Crater, is Latin for "cup." More specifically, it is the Latin spelling of the Greek krater, a type of large cup or vase that was used to dilute wine with water.
