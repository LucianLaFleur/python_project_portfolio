The Head Chef at the Wanmin Restaurant and also a waitress there, Xiangling is extremely passionate about cooking and excels at her signature hot and spicy dishes.Though still young, Xiangling is a true master of the culinary arts with all the skills of a kitchen veteran. She enjoys a good reputation among the hearty eaters at Chihu Rock.There's absolutely no need to be nervous if she wants you to sample her latest creation. It will not disappoint. Promise.—Description from the Official Website[1]
A renowned chef from Liyue. She's extremely passionate about cooking and excels at making her signature hot and spicy dishes.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Xiangling loves cooking, having learned the art from her father. She does not have a discerning eye towards a specific type of cuisine, seeing that food is a way to expand and experiment. She will use anything for her recipes, even unconventional ingredients that would gross out others. Some of the bizarre ingredients that Xiangling uses are slimes and lizards.[2] Even if some of the dishes are not to her liking, Xiangling will not give up and simply press on to modify or start over from scratch.
Her unconventional cooking is what led her to acclaim in both Mondstadt and Liyue. Unlike most cooks, Xiangling is not concerned about mora, stating that food is to nourish and that the smiles on her customers' faces is more than enough for her. She dislikes having to limit herself to a specific style of cooking, seeing it as bland and unsurprising. Likewise, she prefers hands-on cooking, believing that automated cooking is inauthentic.[3]
Outside of cooking, Xiangling is easy to scare and is often pranked by Hu Tao.[4] Despite disliking her pranks, Xiangling does not have a grudge towards her because she occasionally brings her gifts in return for giving her a good laugh.[5]

Xiangling uses the medium female model. She has navy blue hair cut in a bob-like fashion at the front and of unknown length at the back, golden eyes, and a pale complexion.
A Chef with an Appetite for Adventure - Xiangling
Never cook Silk Flower and Sweet Flower together! Turns out it's so sweet it'll give you toothache for three days straight...—A hard-earned pearl of wisdom from Xiangling's notebook
Liyue is home to two rival culinary traditions, conveniently named the "Li" and "Yue" styles. Foodies in Liyue are staunch supporters of one style or the other, and have long been embroiled in a bitter battle to prove the superiority of their style.
In this war waged by culinary snobs, ostentation is everything, flavor gets forgotten, and nothing is a simple matter of taste. Much to the consternation of Liyue's chefs, the Li vs. Yue debate eats up all of the region's rare cooking ingredients in the pursuit of ever-more-pretentious dishes.
Born into a restaurateur family, Xiangling inherited her fair share of this consternation. But she also chose to inherit the Wanmin Restaurant and become one of the few to push back against the status quo.
"Good food is good food, period!" Xiangling's mantra is an antidote to snobbery as she sets about creating her imaginative and unconventional dishes.
From a pinch of Mist Flower and a drop of Slime Condensate to a handful of unidentified flying insects and even hilichurls' wooden clubs, Xiangling is known to be somewhat adventurous with her choice of cooking ingredients.
Naturally, her unique approach leads to the occasional disastrous dish. But Xiangling never gives up, because of what her father has always said to her: "There are many secrets to cooking; the most important of which is passion."
"Coming, coming! Here's your Stir-Fried Filet! And your Mora Meat. And Fried Radish Balls, as you ordered."In Liyue, there's a place called Chihu Rock, and there stands a restaurant known as Wanmin Restaurant.One must remain focused if they want to keep moving forward on the bustling streets of Liyue.Unsuspecting newcomers to this place are often lured away by wonderful culinary aromas or lead to peek inside stores by curious sounds.Xiangling, who is both chef and waitress at the restaurant, delivers steaming, delicious dishes to the tables."Sit anywhere you'd like. I can make whatever you want, even if it's not on the menu!"The workers at Wanmin Restaurant can recognize a regular, if not by their face, then by the first sentence out of their mouths.A customer that orders without needing a menu has been at least a few times before. However, if they ask "Is Xiangling the chef today?" then they're definitely a regular.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Xiangling has destroyed many a wok in her time. Either the insides would become irreversibly charred from the heat of a Pyro Slime, or cracks would appear due to flash-freezing from a Mist Flower — or, at some step in Xiangling's unconventional cooking process, a small-scale explosion would reduce it to scrap metal. After some heavy consideration on the part of Xiangling's father, he ultimately decided not to banish his daughter from the kitchen, despite the destruction she caused.As reckless, imaginative, and uninhibited as she may be, it was exactly these traits that led her to create her most successful dishes. "Maybe this isn't so bad..." He tried to convince himself.Suffice to say that payment for a new wok is a regular feature of the restaurant's monthly ledger.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
"There are many secrets to cooking; the most important of which is passion."When Xiangling decided to learn to be a chef, her father handed her his own handwritten cooking journal, his life's work. That line was written on the title page.If she was any other person, she would likely have regarded it as some cheesy inspirational quote. However, Xiangling regarded it as a priceless treasure.To her, her father only secured his footing in the forever-ongoing war between the Li and Yue cuisines by upholding that principle.However, at that time, the conflict between the two styles was white-hot, with many restaurants feeling the pressure that arose from it. Wanmin Restaurant was no exception."Good food is good food, period!"The monopoly on luxurious ingredients such as matsutake and crabs infuriated Xiangling, her angry response to which was to take over in the kitchen.It was time for her to build upon the foundation her father gave her and make some changes."I'm gonna make super-delicious dishes out of any ingredient!"Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Xiangling's liveliness is disastrous for the hilichurls of Jueyun Karst. They one day awoke to find their fighting clubs gone.Of course, the flora in Dihua Marsh did not fare any better.After all the work she put in, she finally created some new recipes, such as Hilichurl Club BBQ Fish and Horsetail Sticky Rice and Meat...She'd never create anything new if she just stuck to the recipes of her predecessors.One must break with common conception if they are to carve their own path.When Xiangling finally created her crowning achievement, the Chef's Special Cold-Dressed Fowl, her father paid the price, needing to resort to simple white congee for two days following."Mint and Qingxin Flower seem to induce diarrhea..."She learned a valuable experience to add to her journal.Strange. She ate her own dishes, but nothing ever happened to her. Xiangling did feel guilty though.Maybe it was because she was young and healthy, or had somehow built up a resistance to certain toxins... One may never know.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Whenever a customer asks what exactly was the perplexing creature that follows Xiangling around is, she tells them the story:There was a sudden downpour one day when Xiangling was on her way to fetch some Violetgrass. Halfway there, she was already tired and hungry. She stumbled into a cave, and came across a strange shrine.So she sat down by the shrine, and took out two pieces of spicy cornbread.She gobbled down one, but left the other one on the shrine, intending to eat a little later, but then promptly fell asleep.When she woke up, the other spicy cornbread was gone and a mysterious creature was sitting in front of her, staring."Was it good?"It nodded."More?" She took out some jerky from her backpack.The mysterious creature nodded once again.This was how Xiangling made a new friend. It seemed to be drawn to Xiangling's cooking, as the creature started following Xiangling around wherever she went.Xiangling named it "Guoba," after her favorite childhood snack.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
After sampling every dish there was in Liyue, Xiangling's culinary skills drastically improved. Her specialty spicy dishes earned the praise of even her father, a veteran chef with over two decades of experience.She created her unique and complex flavor profile through a generous helping of chili peppers mixed with fruits and herbs for increased aroma. She also created what became the signature dish of Wanmin Restaurant: Black-Back Perch Stew, which combines the richness, color and strong flavors of Li cuisine with the fresh aromas and nutritional content of Yue cuisine.Some have tried to copy her recipes, but try as they might they can never quite reproduce the way her cooking tastes."Braise fresh Violetgrass overnight. Dry, then grind to a fine powder. Sprinkle into any dish for an aromatic boost."This is one of Xiangling's secret recipes, arrived at through a painstaking process of trial and error.In Xiangling's case, that means countless bouts of diarrhea, countless bruised knees bashed on rocky cliffs, and countless wasted potfuls of food that didn't quite turn out as expected.Xiangling's Map Friendship Lv. 4
This map of Teyvat is lined with dense notations in various colors, and if you read closely, you can find the places where Xiangling has been, and where she intends to go in future."The shellfish of the shallows around Guyun Stone Forest are unmatched in their freshness. They say that 'here be sea monsters'?""Sea monster meat tastes great. Should look for Beidou to go fight another one. Will steaming them with eggs make them taste better?""There's a dragon in Mondstadt? Great! I just need three days of provisions to get there.""Valberries are sweet. Lots here. I'll bring a basket. Take some back. See if they'll grow.""This Mondstadt restaurant's Sautéed Matsutake is way too luxurious! They should just sell the matsutake. Ooh, what if I fry some with Jueyun Chili? Sounds good already. Might as well borrow a kitchen tomorrow and give it a go.""Haven't found the dragon yet. Am I in the right place?"...Vision Friendship Lv. 6
"You can make something super delicious out of any kind of ingredient."Xiangling earned the approval of a Vision by shouldering this ideal in a wholehearted and unreserved manner. Even when she would make dishes that could be called "horrifying," her desire to keep trying to match ingredients would never waver."Ugh... Qingxin Fried Lizard is actually kinda bad. I think lizards should just be stone-grilled in future.""Slime fried rice is also rather ordinary. Maybe we'll try putting mushrooms in a slime jus next time."Though her friends fell around her during the epic battles with the taste of her dishes and advised her to turn back, Xiangling never stopped thinking about how to turn these "special" ingredients into delicious food.In Xiangling's innocent and persistent heart, as long as they were not poisonous, there were no good or bad ingredients.Her Vision, after all, proves that even the gods approve of such thinking.

The "master" that Xiangling refers to in her voice-overs is Madame Ping, whom Xiangling reveals is her master during the Moonlight Merriment Event Quest One for the Foodies, Two for the Show.
Between Xiangling's fifth character story and Zhongli's dialogue in the Stone Harbor Treasure Journal event, the addition of Violetgrass to Black-Back Perch Stew is Xiangling's secret touch that not even her father knows about, judging by his expression in the corresponding illustration during the event.
Based on Xiangling's appearance in Zhongli's Character Tale, set shortly before Of the Land Amidst Monoliths (Archon Quest Chapter 1), she returned to Liyue sometime after Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip (her Story Quest), but likely left some time before the Traveler arrives. Her "as yet-unnamed Springvale Boar dish" is likely the dish she used to beat Brook during the cooking competition in Springvale.
Xiangling's side portrait (seen on the Character menu and Inventory) used to differ in design from her official art and in-game model: she had a headband, the bow under her braids was located higher up on her head, and the collar of her outfit was primarily yellow instead of black. It was then fixed in 1.4.
Xiangling is the first character with a Story Quest that takes place outside of her associated region, taking place in Mondstadt while she hails from Liyue. As part of the quest, however, the Traveler travels to the border between Mondstadt and Liyue to collect some Jueyun Chili.
Xiangling is the first playable character to appear in a Commission (The Gourmet Supremos: Breakthrough Thinking).
In Xiangling's wish art, she is seen wielding White Tassel, but in her portrait, she is holding an unknown polearm, and uses Dragon's Bane in her official Character Demo.
Xiangling is mentioned in the description of the following Furnishing: Cottage Kitchen
Xiangling shares her Korean voice actress, Yun A-yeong, with Barbara.
Xiangling's Chinese name, 香菱 Xiānglíng, means "Fragrant Water Caltrop."
She shares her name with a literary character from the Dream of the Red Chamber (红楼梦/紅樓夢), one of China's "Four Great Classical Novels" which was written in the 18th century. However, there is currently no known relation between the literary character and the Genshin Impact character.
Her constellation, Trulla, is the Latin word for "little ladle."
Her constellation name was previously "Ladle" (written in English), but was corrected in a later version.
Guoba (锅巴/鍋巴 Guōbā) means "scorched rice," which is the crust of rice formed in the cooking pot.
She is one of the few people from Liyue whose Japanese name is directly transcribed from Chinese instead of being read as the on'yomi or kun'yomi reading.

You're fine? Phew! Otherwise, he would've made you drink some traditional herbal medicine — it's so bitter!
About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Xiangling About Ningguang.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Xiangling_About_Ningguang.ogg That was the Tianquan! Did you see? She just walked past. Come here... closer... Let me tell you, she knows everything that happens in Liyue, so... keep a low profile, don't attract her attention!

Ugh, that prankster always waits till I least expect it, creeps up on me from behind and then... Boo! ...then laughs herself silly. Hmph.

About Diona Friendship Lv. 4About Diona Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Xiangling About Diona.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Xiangling_About_Diona.ogg Diona, from Springvale! Ah, I heard she mixes a great drink, so I came specifically to see her! I thought perhaps I could use her secrets in my cooking, and bring out more flavors. But the tips that she gave me — like soaking lizard tails in beer, or putting bits of smoked fish in dandelion wine — all came out really awful. *sigh* Guess it's up to me to work it out myself, then.
About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Xiangling About Beidou.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Xiangling_About_Beidou.ogg Oh, Beidou is the greatest! Every time I go out sailing with her, she always manages to fish up lots of fresh ingredients! Octopus tentacles go great in soup, and seaweed fries up great with some chilies.

About Zhongli Friendship Lv. 4About Zhongli Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Xiangling About Zhongli.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Xiangling_About_Zhongli.ogg I've come across a lot of fussy eaters, but Mr. Zhongli is very particular and has no problem getting straight to what he has to say. The first time I served him salt and pepper tofu, he took just one bite, and then proceeded to say: "It would be better to try sea salt extracted from the shallow seas of Guyun Stone Forest, because it would bring a fresh sense of depth to the tofu." I tried it and the taste was just so different! He's just amazing, don't you think!?
About Chongyun Friendship Lv. 4About Chongyun Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Xiangling About Chongyun.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Xiangling_About_Chongyun.ogg Chongyun? I always see him on his way to eat at Wanmin Restaurant with Xingqiu... Ah... or perhaps I should say I see him being dragged there by Xingqiu? Chongyun doesn't eat hot food. Every time the hot food arrives, Xingqiu politely apologizes and proceeds to try every dish. I just wanna dig in with him! The look on Chongyun's face is priceless. They're quite interesting, those two.
About Ganyu Friendship Lv. 4About Ganyu Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Xiangling About Ganyu.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Xiangling_About_Ganyu.ogg Ganyu? Oh... Oh yeah! I remember her — vegetarian, right? She doesn't come to the Wanmin Restaurant very often — but when she does, she sits alone in the corner and eats her meal in total silence. Poor girl, she seems kinda lonely... I always give her an extra-large portion because I feel sorry for her. Funniest thing is, she eats every last bite, every time! I wouldn't have guessed she had such an appetite just by looking at her.
About Yaoyao Friendship Lv. 4About Yaoyao Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Xiangling About Yaoyao.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Xiangling_About_Yaoyao.ogg Hee-hee, I'm proud to call her my junior! She hasn't swung by the Wanmin Restaurant in ages, though. Maybe master is trying to protect her from me or something... Last time we hung out, I was about to dig into some fresh raw octopus from the Sea of Clouds, but not only did she stop me from eating it, she sent master to tell me off too! Ugh... Honestly, sometimes it feels like I'm the one who gets treated like the junior...
About Xinyan Friendship Lv. 4About Xinyan Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Xiangling About Xinyan.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Xiangling_About_Xinyan.ogg Xinyan always comes to the Wanming Restaurant for a late-night snack! She gobbles up all the new dishes that the likes of Xingqiu and Chongyun don't go near... and nine times out of ten, she enjoys them too! She's great.(Actual Voice-Over: Xinyan always comes to the Wanmin Restaurant for a late-night snack! She gobbles up all the new dishes that the likes of Xingqiu and Chongyun don't go near... and nine times out of ten, she enjoys them too! She's great.)
About Yelan Friendship Lv. 4About Yelan Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Xiangling About Yelan.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Xiangling_About_Yelan.ogg Yelan? Of course, I remember her! When I first met her, I was certain she'd be the kind of gal who'd prefer lighter dishes... turned out that she can handle the most spice out of all my customers! Apparently, my dishes weren't spicy enough for her, because she started taking bites of raw Jueyun Chilis! Truly amazing.
About Gaming Friendship Lv. 4About Gaming Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Xiangling About Gaming.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Xiangling_About_Gaming.ogg Oh boy, once I know Gaming is coming, I make sure to prepare a huge pot of tea in advance. You know, so he can wash some of the spicy food down. I've offered to tone down the spice a bit for him, but he absolutely insists that he prefers the authentic flavor... And he's not even just saying that to be polite. Believe me, I know a true foodie when I see one! Anyway, if that's what he prefers, then who am I to disappoint, hehe!

Come, let me fry up one of Guoba's chili peppers for you...

It's time to introduce you to my latest masterpiece — I call it "the most marvelous multi-colored super pancake"!

It isn't like me to get so worked up over nothing... Ah! Well, here's the thing. I always love getting you to try my latest recipes, but...

About Zhongli...: In Chinese, Xiangling says (parts that are the same as English omitted): "[...] but the precision of Mr. Zhongli's palate is really one-of-a-kind. The other day, I first served him salt and pepper tofu. He took just one bite, then asked me what kind of salt I used. Then he said... what was it... [...]"

Media:vo xiangling mimitomo hello 01.ogg Xiangling: Hello, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)...
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo hello 02.ogg Xiangling: I was just coming up with a new dish... don't worry, nothing too strange!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Xiangling: I love it! Very cozy. And there are so many new and interesting things I've never seen before!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Xiangling: Just a shame more of them aren't potential ingredients...
 Considering all the things you class as ingredients, that's really saying something.
 I'll see what I can do about that...
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Xiangling: Hee-hee...
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Xiangling: But really... Don't worry about it!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Xiangling: Combining existing ingredients in new ways already allows for countless variations in flavor.
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Xiangling: The trick is to keep playing with different pairings — I've got plenty of new concepts to try out!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship1 07.ogg Xiangling: But, um... What would really make a difference is if you could taste-test them a—and give me some feedback.
 Sure! I'll give you my honest opinion. No sugarcoating.
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship1 08.ogg Xiangling: Waah! Really? Great, I'll get cooking!
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Xiangling: Absolutely! Service isn't for a while yet, so there's nothing on the stove.
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Xiangling: Yep! Gastronomy just makes me happy!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Xiangling: The best part is seeing smiles on my customers' faces. Those are the real fruits of my labor!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Xiangling: Oh — and...
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Xiangling: ...It's really nothing to do with rare ingredients, secret recipes, or anything like that.
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Xiangling: I just use my own methods and try to bring out the best in every ingredient! Certainly seems to satisfy my customers.
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Xiangling: Still... it can be difficult at times.
 You mean when dishes don't work out?
 You mean when new concepts don't sell?
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Xiangling: Um... That does happen... but I wasn't talking so much about the food as...
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Xiangling: Well, sometimes, customers get to talking to each other, and they chat for so long that their food starts to get cold...
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Xiangling: I know I shouldn't really interrupt them, but reheating the food just ruins the flavor...
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship2 11a.ogg Xiangling: It is! I knew you'd get it!
 But there's nothing much you can do about it.
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship2 11b.ogg Xiangling: *sigh* Yeah, I know... I guess I just have to learn to not let it get to me.
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship2 12.ogg Xiangling: Hehe, I feel a lot better after talking to you about it though.
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Xiangling: I want to go adventuring with you!
 Again? Isn't that what we always do?
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 02a 1.ogg Xiangling: Mm-hmm! Sure is!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 02a 2.ogg Xiangling: But even so, it's still the thing I wanna do most!
 I thought you'd want me to sample one of your creations.
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 02b.ogg Xiangling: Taste-testing is all part of the adventure!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Xiangling: I want to go adventuring with you into the unknown, collect strange new ingredients from all over Teyvat, and invent new recipes for you to sample!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Xiangling: Ahh... the more I consider it, the more I think nothing could ever make me happier!
 (Happiness à la Xiangling is beautifully simple...)
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Xiangling: Huh? You okay?
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Xiangling: You seem very quiet... Y—You don't like the idea?
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Xiangling: I won't add any strange seasonings... promise!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Xiangling: Um — what I mean is... I'll definitely get your opinion before acting on any eureka moments!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Xiangling: A—Also, I won't slow you down when we're out in the wilderness!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Xiangling: And if I encounter any serious enemies, I promise I won't cause any trouble. First sign of danger, I'll run as fast as I can...
 I never said I didn't like the idea...
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 11a.ogg Xiangling: Phew! ...You scared the heck out of me.
 What you said got me thinking, that's all.
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 11b.ogg Xiangling: Ohhhh...
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Xiangling: ...Awesome!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 13.ogg Xiangling: A—Anyway, I'll make sure to keep working on my cooking... a—and any other skills that might come in handy!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo friendship3 14.ogg Xiangling: Anything to put a smile on your face!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo morning 01.ogg Xiangling: Morning! Have you had enough for breakfast, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo morning 02.ogg Xiangling: Adventuring on an empty stomach is a recipe for disaster!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo night 01.ogg Xiangling Good night, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!
Media:vo xiangling mimitomo night 02.ogg Xiangling Get some rest! Tomorrow, I'll make something tasty for you!
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.
Media:vo mimitomo ly xiangling kitchen 01.ogg Xiangling: Chefs can't be picky about location! No matter what kitchen appliances there are, I'll be back to cooking like I normally do after a few practice rounds!
Media:vo mimitomo ly xiangling kitchen 02.ogg Xiangling: Of course, you can't skimp on ingredients — only the freshest will do!
Media:vo mimitomo ly xiangling kitchen 03.ogg Xiangling: Hmm... There isn't too much stocked here. I'll whip up some food for us, so could you go and help me buy some ingredients?
Media:vo mimitomo ly xiangling restaurant 01.ogg Xiangling: Awesome! This little street of eateries is pretty similar to Chihu Rock, but if you look closer, there are a lot of differences, too!
Media:vo mimitomo ly xiangling restaurant 02.ogg Xiangling: Let's go look at different restaurants together and see what makes each place unique, okay?
Media:vo mimitomo ly xiangling restaurant 03.ogg Xiangling: After that, I'll open another Wanmin Restaurant right here!
