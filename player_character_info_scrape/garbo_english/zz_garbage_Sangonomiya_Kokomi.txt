Personality
The Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island. All of the island's affairs are at this young lady's fingertips.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
As the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island, Kokomi handles almost all of the affairs on the island herself. While she is not content with such a burden, having preferred to be a military advisor, she nonetheless takes the mantle to give her people the hope and happiness they deserve. Like Jean, Kokomi easily burns herself out completing her tasks and tries to keep it hidden from others to avoid worrying them.
Along with handling all sorts of affairs, Kokomi is a skilled strategist that thinks of all potential scenarios and how to handle them as a result of reading plenty of military books, although she also enjoys casual reading. Kujou Sara remarks that her planning prevented the Tenryou Commission from claiming full victory over the Watatsumi Army. She continues this habit even outside of military affairs. As a result of the role she plays, she is universally beloved by her people.

Kokomi uses the medium female model. She has long, pale salmon pink hair and light indigo eyes with no pupil and a large white highlight at the top of her iris.

Official Introduction
Victory Through Wisdom
Her Excellency, Sangonomiya, is an astute strategist. She can accurately predict enemy movements from thousands of miles of way. When we fought against the Shogun's army, what we lacked in manpower and weaponry, we more than made up for with Her Excellency's tactical prowess. Were it not for Her Excellency, not a single one of Watatsumi Island's victories would have been possible.—Gorou
The Divine Priestess and supreme leader of Watatsumi Island [sic]
Many believe Sangonomiya Kokomi to be an enigmatic, shrewd leader. However, she always has a quiet smile on her face, and while she gets things done in an orderly fashion, she will sometimes do so over laughter and light conversation.
Having read many military treatises from all over Teyvat since she was a child, Kokomi has a talent for strategy and is capable of outwitting opponents through clever stratagems. Although Watatsumi Island lacks manpower and materiel, its people have managed to turn the tide of battle many times thanks to Kokomi's tactical prowess. Whether in battle, trade, diplomacy, or internal affairs, Kokomi will do her best. Her achievements have won her the respect of Watatsumi Island's various factions.
"Never fear, Her Excellency Sangonomiya is here," has become a popular saying amongst the people of Watatsumi Island.
However, few people know that Kokomi's biggest aspiration has always been to merely be an adviser behind the scenes. Socializing with others is in fact a most tiring task for her. Her hands shake every time she gives a speech, and she entertains thoughts of retreating into herself every time work starts piling up. She enjoys herself most while holed up at home after finishing her work, face buried in her military strategy books.
To reach a lofty post at such a young age is considered a great achievement, but for Kokomi, the higher up one is on the mountain, the more treacherous the path.

Version 2.1 Preview Introduction
The Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island.
All of the island's affairs are at this young lady's fingertips.
The desire to protect Watatsumi Island lives on in the bloodline of the Sangonomiya Clan. The current heir to this bloodline is known as the Divine Priestess. The meaning behind this is as such: to inherit the will of a god in a mortal's body, and to defend this land and its people in that god's stead.

Character Stories
Character Details
The inhabitants of Watatsumi Island once lived in Enkanomiya, at the bottom of the sea.It was only by the grace of the god Orobaxi bringing them up to the surface that the civilization of Watatsumi Island exists today.When Orobaxi was slain by the Electro Archon, its body was left as a skeleton and its resentment permeated the land, giving rise to Tatarigami.Yet its desire to protect Watatsumi Island never faded. This will lives on in the bloodline of the Sangonomiya Clan, and follows them from generation to generation.The current heir to this bloodline is known as the Divine Priestess.The meaning behind this is as such: to inherit the will of a god in a mortal's body, and to defend this land and its people in that god's stead.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
The day Kokomi ascended to the role of Divine Priestess, countless inhabitants of Watatsumi Island came to Sangonomiya Shrine of their own accord to see her.Surprise, suspicion, confusion, chuckles... Their expressions were strange, all on account of her overly-young appearance in their eyes.Plots were hatched and questions were endless. The ambitious planned to make their move. The storm was approaching, and all was not at peace on Watatsumi Island.Yet all went back to business as usual not long after Kokomi ascended to her position.She was fair in distributing rewards and punishments alike, appreciated the contributions of the people, and was militarily skilled. Her many abilities quickly won the hearts of most of the people."Things will be alright as long as Her Excellency is here" soon became the most widespread saying on the island.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
There are many factors involved in deciding victory or defeat.Terrain, weather, differences in military strength and equipment quality... All of these require careful consideration.Those who study the details too closely tend to miss changes on the field, and most who speak of strategy speak of it in a vacuum.Only those who can grasp both the big picture and the small details can create miracles on the battlefield.And behind all this lies countless hours of hard work delving into the reasons behind one's failures.Few if any ever persevere to the end, but Kokomi was not only good at this but also possessed a unique tactical style."Manipulate the larger strategic situation to force the other side to give up, and to win wars with the least amount of cost possible."Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Whether on the battlefield or off it, Kokomi tries to "know thy enemy" as much as possible.She tends to predict all possible scenarios beforehand and devise strategies to address them, which are then delivered as directives to those who enforce her will.This has given rise to the issue of some of these directives being rather thick and heavy, but this method has guaranteed the stable development of Watatsumi Island.Today, Watatsumi Island moves each day towards greater prosperity, and as more talented people have been appointed to office, the directives that Kokomi has to deliver have decreased.As far as she is concerned, that is something worth celebrating.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
When Kokomi has the time to spare, she will go on walks on Watatsumi Island alone.She often tries to avoid crowds, pacing slowly through the violet forests, sometimes sitting by the seaside and looking out into the distance.The sun and the moon rise over the sea, the stars shine in their skies, and the sound of the waves is pleasing to the ear, relaxing the soul.Sometimes she will even place a seashell on her head, only to put it back where she found it when she leaves.In her mind, perhaps some wandering crab will burrow its way inside and call this shell home.Sometimes, Kokomi will also go diving, enjoying the calm atmosphere by herself, her worries sinking into the ocean depths as schools of fish swim all around her.Kokomi treasures every sight there is to be seen on Watatsumi Island, and she remembers the name of every person.Sadly, while scenery remains, people's hearts are complex and changeable.Victory is simple enough to attain compared to the mammoth task of making sure that everyone lives happily.This dilemma has always troubled her.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Kokomi has been well-read since she was young, and has a particular love for military treatises.As such, Kokomi has a broad store of knowledge to be used in every field.But another result of her constantly being buried in such treatises of war and illustrated military texts is that Kokomi lacks skill in social interaction. She does not know when it started, but interacting with people eventually became tiresome to her.Having ascended to the role of Divine Priestess, Kokomi had no choice but to learn many things that she wasn't any good at before, whether it was dealing with people or performing duties that she had little interest in.However, forcing herself to do things she holds little love for is a serious drain on her energy reserves, leaving her feeling quite exhausted.As such, Kokomi set up an "energy" system of measurement for herself. When she does things she enjoys, her energy levels will increase, and the reverse is true when she trudges through unenjoyable slogs.When she runs out of this energy, Kokomi will temporarily put her duties as the Divine Priestess aside and resume being an ordinary homebody.Engrossing herself in the close reading of a book on military strategy, walling herself off from the rest of the world — thus does Kokomi reclaim a temporary respite from her busy existence.These moments are of utmost value to her.Secret Notes Friendship Lv. 4  •  Warriors' Dreams Like Spring Grass Renewing
"As the ruler is, so shall the people be."This precept was something Kokomi heard from her mother a long time ago.The Divine Priestess' role is one of utmost importance to Watatsumi Island, and its people's eyes are always upon her every move.The things she loves will be in fashion, and the things she dislikes, the people will also distance themselves from.Kokomi, in truth, has no wish to affect the people's lives, and as such has rarely ever revealed much of her personal likes or dislikes.She treats all things with an egalitarian manner, and holds "fairness of judgment" and "justice in dispensing rewards and punishment" to be her guiding principles.However, these are not necessarily her true feelings, and so she prepared a book of secret notes for herself.Here, she records the fluctuations in both her energy levels and mood.When the night deepens and the world falls silent, Kokomi will open this book and write the day's experiences, whether they be joyous, sad, or frustrating....Of course, this object is for her eyes only — and so it must remain.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
A leader with a strong will can lead those around them in a clear direction.However, Kokomi lacks such strong ideals. Instead, she respects the will of the people and wishes that they can each find their own way.Just as the vast ocean can accommodate countless souls and their individual desires, so does Kokomi wish her rule could be.When the Vision Hunt Decree came about, the resentment of the people turned into cries of revolt, and so Kokomi led them in raising the banner of resistance.And once the war was over, the hearts of the people turned towards peace and stability, and so did Kokomi direct her energies towards governance and economics.But what was the source of this toil? Was this the role of the Divine Priestess speaking? Or was this a product of her own sense of duty? Or perhaps... it was a bit of both?As the Divine Priestess, Kokomi naturally has her own Vision. And ever since the day she looked out at the sea outside Sangonomiya Shrine, her wish has never once changed—"I wish to protect all of Watatsumi Island and allow its people to lead happy lives."

Trivia
Kokomi is the first character to have a negative CRIT Rate by default. As such, she cannot deal CRIT DMG without artifacts to bring this value to positive.
Sangonomiya Kokomi is known by these aliases or titles:
Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island
Her Excellency
Sole of the Deep (pen name)
Kokomi can be seen reading one of the volumes of the Inazuman book collection A Legend of Sword during one of her idle animations. It also seems from one of her voice lines that she is a big fan of the series.[2]
Sangonomiya Kokomi is mentioned in the descriptions of the following 3 Furnishings: Scarlet-Scented Fan Dance Thrice-Dyed Crimson Snowmelt Scholarly Trove
Etymology
Sangonomiya Kokomi, like other Inazuman characters with their full names listed, is arranged in the traditional Japanese order of surname listed before given name. Sangonomiya (Japanese: 珊瑚宮) means "coral shrine," and Kokomi (Japanese: 心海) literally means "mind sea," which compares the beating of the heart with the rippling of the sea.
The Japanese character 心 refers to an abstract term that describes human conscience or emotion in a spiritual sense, but is usually translated as "heart," "soul," or "mind." In Kokomi's case, this may reflect her cunning and strategical prowess, as well as how she represents the people of Watatsumi Island.
In the Japanese Translation, Her title of "Divine Priestess" (Japanese: 神の巫女) uses part of the same Kanji as Arahitogami (Japanese: 現人神). Arahitogami's are a deity/god who has taken a human form.
Kokomi's constellation name, Dracaena Somnolenta (Chinese: 眠龙座 Miánlóng-zuò, "Sleeping Dragon Constellation"; Japanese: 睡竜座 Suiryou-za, "Sleeping Dragon Constellation"), is likely a reference to the Chinese politician Zhuge Liang (181–234 AD), who was known for being a great military strategist and was nicknamed "Hidden Dragon" (Chinese: 伏龙 Fúlóng; Japanese: 伏龍 Fukuryou) or "Crouching Dragon" (Chinese: 卧龙 Wòlóng; Japanese: 臥龍 Garyou).
As a talented strategist and an avid reader, most of Sangonomiya Kokomi's stories and abilities refer to East Asian classics in military, philosophy, and poetry. See each article for details.
The title of her first story quest Warriors' Dreams Like Spring Grass Renewing - a reference to a haiku from Oku no Hosomichi (1702) by the Japanese poet Matsuo Bashou (1644–1694).
Directions during the subquest Watatsumi Sightseeing - references to the Six Secret Teachings, a Chinese military strategy book written before the 2th century BC, and Zhuge Liang's stratagem as appeard in the Chinese historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (14th century).
Lines during the subquest Her Secret - quotations from a commentary by the Chinese warlord Cao Cao (155–220) on the Chinese strategist Sun Tzu's The Art of War (circa the 5th century BC).
The special food A Stunning Stratagem - a reference to Zhuge Liang's stratagem in the novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (the same as above).
The attack The Shape of Water - a word play on a phrase from Sun Tzu's The Art of War.
Ceremonial Garment from the skill Nereid's Ascension - references to the Ryukyuan mythology about the divine sea realm Nirai Kanai and the Japanese folklore about celestial beings (tennin).
The talent Tamanooya's Casket - probably references to
the Japanese mythology on the imperial jewel Yasakani no Magatama believed to be created by the Shinto god Tamano'oya,
an Old Japanese poem by the poet Takahashi no Mushimaro (fl. ca 730) about the sea-goddess Oto-hime, her mortal lover Urashima Tarou, and the forbidden casket Tamatebako from Man'youshuu (759),
and a political philosophy book by the Japanese linguist and philosopher Moto'ori Norinaga (1730–1801).
The talent Song of Pearls - likely a reference to Omoro Soushi, or divine Ryukyuan songs on the Ryukyuan mythology, officially compiled by the Ryukyu Kingdom between 1531–1623.
The talent Flawless Strategy - a reference to Sun Tzu's The Art of War.
The 1st constellation At Water's Edge - a reference to Sun Tzu's The Art of War.
The 2nd constellation The Clouds Like Waves Rippling - an excerpt from a poem by the Japanese poet Kakinomoto no Hitomaro (circa 660–724), recorded in Man'youshuu.
The 3rd constellation The Moon, A Ship O'er the Seas - an excerpt from a Chinese poem composed by Emperor Monmu of Japan (683–707), recorded in Kaifuusou (751).
The 4th constellation The Moon Overlooks the Waters - references to the Song of Enlightenment allegedly written by the Chinese Zen monk Yongjia Xuanjue (665–713) and a Neo-Confucian concept by the Chinese philosopher Zhu Xi (1130–1200).
The 5th constellation All Streams Flow to the Sea - a reference to Bansenshuukai ("Myriad Rivers Merge into the Sea"), a Japanese military book on the art of ninja compiled by Fujibayashi Yasutake in 1678.

HelloHelloMedia:VO_Sangonomiya Kokomi Hello.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Sangonomiya_Kokomi_Hello.ogg I am Sangonomiya Kokomi, the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island. My journey with you will be an opportunity to unwind... Ahem, I mean... to survey beyond our borders. Don't worry, I've left behind ample directives in my absence, and have also completed the island's projected development plans. Departing for a brief period will be of little consequence.

Before the onset of battle, I bring every possible scenario into consideration, and turn my thoughts into written directives. These are then issued to the troops. ...It does seem at present like they're somewhat over-reliant on the directives, which worries me... If they read up on military strategy themselves, they could begin to rely on their own ability to read the battlefield. I need them to be able to identify and seize opportunities in the heat of the moment.

I must admit, Kujou Sara is an opponent that cannot be taken lightly. She seldom employs cunning strategy, but her performance in open warfare is always admirable. The Shogun's Army places great trust in her abilities — they are united and ready to fight valiantly under her command, even to the death. Her forces have been a serious threat to the resistance on multiple occasions.

It has never been my intent to scrutinize the rights and wrongs of the Shogun's actions, even to this day. What I do care about is the future of our island.

But Beidou assured me of her fleet's unwavering discipline, and that raids could be carried out without detection. In the end, she was right, and that's exactly what happened. Now, every time the Watatsumi fleet encounters some sort of bottleneck, I consider inviting her to come and give them her instruction. There's no doubt, she runs a tight ship...

Kazuha has a carefree personality and doesn't like constraints, but he would follow every command to the letter when he was among our ranks. In my opinion, not only is he an outstanding swordsman, but a very refined character.

A Tenryou Commission samurai would never be that brazen, and a Tenryou Commission spy would never be that conspicuous. Shortly after, I discovered that he was a self-proclaimed "detective" by the name of Shikanoin, and that he took no interest in military, government, or commercial affairs. Instead, he seemed to have arrived for a bit of sightseeing. As such, I set a few eyes on him, but refrained from taking any action to remove him from the island. Be sure to talk to him if the chance ever presents itself.

Dialogue

Media:vo kokomi mimitomo hello 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh, you have returned, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo hello 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I've just wrapped up the administrative affairs for today. Perhaps we can afford a moment to relax together?
 How do you like it here?
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I felt a little like a fish out of water when I first arrived.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I mean... After years of studying the art of war, I can't help but consider all the strategic points upon arriving in a new place like this.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Where would the enemy troops set up camp? From which direction could they mount an assault? And what strategies should we implement to counter these factors?
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: We need a barricade here... another sentry tower there... I began to instinctively consider all these things when I first arrived here.
 It's quite safe inside the Serenitea Pot, you know.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... Yes, I eventually realized that I was overthinking things.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: After residing here for a while, I've grown more accustomed to the scenery and my mind has gradually come to be at peace.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship1 07.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: If you ask me, I would say this is almost an ideal place. I can easily separate myself from the outside world and enjoy some time to myself...
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship1 08.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh, but could I rent a room to use as a command post? I need a place to lay out my maps and battle scenarios.
 Of course you can.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship1 09.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Splendid. I would certainly like to stay here for some time. I can just lay on my bed and enjoy my strategy books, far from the pressures of social interaction.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship1 10.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'll finally have all the energy I need every day. Mm, just thinking about it makes me happy.
 But, won't you feel lonely?
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship1 11.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Perhaps, if I'm all alone.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship1 12.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: But, you'll still be here, correct?
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Sure, what would you like to talk about?
 I'd like to hear more about you, Kokomi.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: More about me? Mm... I don't mind. I only worry that you may find the topic a little boring.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I remember I used to always stay home all by myself when I was little. I didn't really have any friends... In fact, I seldom spoke to anyone.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: When I found myself bored with little to do, I would skim through the various books we had lying around the house.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Among the piles of texts on governmental affairs and diplomacy, there were a few books on the art of war. They were like gems to me.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I remember thinking at the time that it would be perfect to work as an adviser someday. Whenever Her Excellency would come to me for advice, I could put on a show and mysteriously hand her a directive.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Then, I could just snuggle right back up in my blanket and continue sleeping with no fear of anyone disrupting me.
 However, in reality...
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm. I suppose I never expected that someone like me who was used to staying home would be promoted to such a position.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I clearly remember that on my first day as priestess, I had well over one hundred people come pay their respects to me.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I did my best to carefully record each of their names, but after about twenty people or so, I had already lost track.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship2 11.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Eventually, I would feign that I was busy handling administrative affairs while using the papers to make a rough sketch of them with their name noted to the side for memorization later.
 That sounds pretty tiresome.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship2 12.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... This is why I am so happy whenever I see you making progress.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship2 13.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Perhaps one day, you'll be even more suited than myself to appear before people, and even better prepared to carry their hopes forward.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship2 14.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: When that day comes, I can serve as your adviser. Wouldn't that be nice?
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
 Anything you want to do?
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: If the opportunity arises, I would like to take you diving with me.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: The world is full of troubles. But when compared with the vastness of the sea, all those troubles seem to just fade away.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Though the ages pass and time brings change, the sea continues as it always has. As I float down among the depths of the sea, a deep tranquility permeates my heart.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: There are times when I feel utterly exhausted, so I thought I should share with you the way that I unwind.
 But how would I breathe underwater?
 I wouldn't call myself the best swimmer...
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... That is indeed a problem.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Wait, I've come up with a clever solution.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'll wrap the two of us in a gigantic bubble... We can slowly sink down into the sea together.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: This way, we can journey together underwater! You'll feel refreshed before you know it.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Though I've never gone diving together with anyone before, I must say that I certainly look forward to it.
 Is there anything that I should prepare beforehand?
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: No, not at all. The purpose of the trip is to relax, after all. Simply do as you please.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Besides, you will have the "grand strategist" accompanying you.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: You need only focus on resting and I'll take care of the details.
(Between 6:00 and 19:00)
 Morning, Kokomi.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo morning 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Good morning, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). I trust you slept well?
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo morning 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: A journey is much like a battle, you cannot set out exhausted.
(Between 19:00 and 6:00)
 Good night, Kokomi.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo night 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Good night, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo night 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: It'll be my turn to make breakfast tomorrow. You'll be able to sleep in.
Media:vo kokomi mimitomo night 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'll be sure to wake you once breakfast is ready.

Eternal Domain of Fleeting Dreams

Media:vo mimitomo dq kokomi bedroom 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: The distance between the bed and the kotatsu is exactly right, and the placement of the wardrobe is eminently sensible...
Media:vo mimitomo dq kokomi bedroom 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: My bedroom is my quiet space. Once I close the door, no one can disturb me...
Media:vo mimitomo dq kokomi bedroom 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...With the exception of you, of course.

Scholarly Trove

Media:vo mimitomo dq kokomi study 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Wow... You kept this a secret, didn't you?
Media:vo mimitomo dq kokomi study 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: There are all kinds of texts here, even my favorite periodicals. Does this mean... You read them, too?
Media:vo mimitomo dq kokomi study 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I—I'd love to hear what you think about them!
