Description[]
By the time you arrived at Starsnatch Cliff, Mona had already been waiting for you for some time.
She was looking up at the starry sky, a song you did not recognize on her lips. As you approached, a sudden urge to prank her came over you... But even as you crept up, angling to clap her on the shoulder, she stopped singing.
"If you were trying to scare me, I'm afraid you're too late."
Ah, as one might have expected from Mona Megistus, the Astrologist. Your attempt failed, you could only sit beside her. Clearing her throat, Mona began to speak in a professorial tone—
"The stars are truly lovely today, making this a fine night to watch the sky. And now that I've convinced the couple who are usually here to leave, this is now the perfect spot to conduct our class on the 'Basics of Astrology.'"
Huh. So that's why you hadn't seen Marvin or Marla.
"Then let's begin."
"'Astrology' is an umbrella term for the study of the laws that govern the movements of matter. The celestial bodies are but a shallow subject of research in this regard..."
You understood the basic preamble just fine, but as she continued to speak, the topic grew more complicated, and you started to lose the plot. Still, she spoke so enthusiastically about the subject that you could not bring yourself to interrupt.
Looking at her bright gray eyes and her constant gesticulations, you couldn't help but feel some embarrassment... Wait a moment.
"Did you change your clothes?"
Seeming to not expect your question, she seemed a little put on the spot at first, though she recovered quickly.
"That's right. I'm wearing these new clothes just to commemorate this momentous occasion as your astrology teacher. You can take this as a sign of... uh, respect."
Feeling a little guilty, you told yourself to get serious. Slapping the sagging, sleeping cheeks of yours, you forced your eyes open and continued listening to her lecture.
"The laws of matter are actually very simple. Rather, it is the principles that govern humanity that are the most complex. As such, we astrologists..."
All the while, you thought to yourself, don't fall asleep, don't fall asleep, don't... Zzz...
"Heh. What am I going to do with you..." Your astrology master mutters.

Personality
A mysterious young astrologer who proclaims herself to be "Astrologist Mona Megistus," and who possesses abilities to match the title. Erudite, but prideful.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Mona is an astrologist who takes her passion seriously. She is very knowledgeable in this subject in part and respects, yet also fears Barbeloth, her master, at the same time. She combines her astrology skills with hydromancy, which makes her a well-known, if still growing astrologist. In part due to her astrology, Mona can tell whether or not a person is lying, can sense their intentions from a single glance, being capable of seeing their fate and is able to accurately deduce a person's traits just from knowing what their constellation is.
Being obsessed with astrology gives Mona a sense of pride, but this also serves as a double-edged sword; any Mora she gets her hands on is immediately spent on astrology-related materials, regardless of its cost. She only realizes too late when she has run out of Mora to meet her daily needs, occasionally going without shelter or food for days on end. She is particularly picky when it comes to eating, as she prefers simple dishes when eating out; when she cooks, she makes the most out of whatever she can buy.[2] She does not tolerate those who disrespect her.[3] She also makes a lot of denials when someone is pointing out what she doesn't have.

Appearance

Mona uses the medium female model. She has fair skin, pale sea green eyes, and waist-length dark purple hair that turns slightly red at the ends. Her fringe is uneven.

Official Introduction
The shining stars above have long decided the fate of all.
Astrologist Mona Megistus's essays are truly fascinating. Not that I really get it, but it's super interesting nonetheless.—Ziwei, a long-time reader of The Steambird.
Mona is unique among astrologers — others may speak with great ostentation for money, but Mona has never done so. Nor does she dress up or mince her words, even if her results are unpleasant to hear: "You won't amount to anything even if you join the Adventurers' Guild." "You've got no chance with him. In fact, he will soon leave you" — such is the nature of her rejoinders.
Her blunt nature has resulted in plummeting numbers of people coming to have their fortunes told. But Mona isn't one to complain, for that just leaves her with more time for her personal research.
But when one speaks of research, one also speaks of the necessity of purchasing texts and research apparatus. Mona's only income comes from her contributions to The Steambird's "All Things Astrological" column. Every paycheck is spent first on her research. Books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... all of these come with a hefty price tag, and by the time Mona regains her senses, there's only enough of her income left for her to scrape by each month.
"It matters not. Astrologers must rid themselves of material desires. Only by ridding oneself of clutter can one see the true world around them." So says Mona, coughing loudly all the while to cover the sound of her growling stomach.
Today, too, is another day Mona worries about Mora.

Character Stories
Character Details
Teyvat is a place where people of all sorts go about their business. Merchants move products, knights patrol, and farmers till the land.But if one were to ask Mona — the enigmatic and prideful astrologist — what she busies herself with, she will reply by saying that she is servicing a debt known as "life."She will, however, vigorously deny being "poor," giving the following explanation:"Beautiful veneers may obscure simple truths.Exquisite food may mask its nutritional value.One lives simply, all the better to expose this world's truths."A frugal lifestyle, therefore, is a form of training to access the truth... Or so Mona will insist.Teyvat is a place where people of all sorts go about their business, and even an enigmatic astrologist must look to hers.—That said, it seems like bards might be the exception to this rule.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2  •  Beyond This World's Stars
Recently, Mona's teacher, an old but highly skilled female astrologist, has entrusted a very important task to her.Her teacher has an erstwhile rival-friend in Mondstadt, and she wanted Mona to retrieve a highly confidential box from that person's successor."If you dare look inside that books... Well, you'll see."That was the warning Mona received before departing.To Mona's surprise, this successor was none other than the Spark Knight, Klee.The box was still extant, but due to Klee's actions and a series of accidents... Mona unwittingly unraveled the enigma behind the box."I—I'm done for. The thing inside this was the dark history of her youth... she will kill me if I go back like this..."Mona was thus forced to stay in Mondstadt, beginning a bitterly frugal but bountifully fulfilling existence.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
Mona's astrology utilizes hydromancy, and she once explained the underlying principles thusly:"It is people's fate that shines in the night sky, and though its reflection in water is but an illusion, it reveals the truth nonetheless."No one else can quite comprehend this principle, but Mona's ability convinces people to believe in it anyway.Albeit, sometimes grudgingly...Her astrological readings are exceptionally precise, and she will neither lie nor hold anything back when revealing the results of her readings."Your son says that he's made it. That's a lie.""You've got no chance with him. In fact, he will soon leave you."The cold, hard truth is laid bare before people's eyes, complete with all the grisly details that they would rather remained buried.Mona will make no exceptions to this, and as such she can seem completely lacking in human emotion.But sometimes, on a clear night, she can be seen on a high mountain slope.There, Mona gazes up at the stars in the sky — so close, she feels, that she could almost reach out and touch them — with gentle eyes, humming an unknown tune to herself.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Having never studied the art of finance, the astrologist Mona is always hovering around the poverty line.In order to save on food expenses, she once ate mushrooms for an entire month straight. If not for some relief funds coming from time to time, she would have had trouble eking out a living.Mona does in fact have some money set aside. Even though she must eventually run dry without an income, she can slow the bleeding by scrimping in the food department.So where does the rest of the Mora go? Well, if you've ever had a look inside her lab, then know that the big pile of astrology-related apparatus and tools in there didn't come out of thin air.In fact, all of them come with a hefty price tag — books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... The shipping fees alone are impressive.That Mona should be in abject poverty comes, therefore, as no surprise.In order to support herself, Mona eventually took up a commercial contract — her contributions to a column about constellation in The Steambird have become her most stable income source.Now having a monthly income, Mona could have left her life of poverty. But how could an astrologist's pursuit of knowledge end here?Whenever she gets paid, Mona will immediately shell out on more astrology-related resources, returning to a state of destitution once more.This process plays out every month.Today, too, is another day Mona worries over Mora.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5  •  Beyond This World's Stars
Mona will sometimes meet up with Klee and Albedo, her primary reason being to get a free meal.Secondary to that is to exchange pointers with Albedo.Since they are both people who seek to unveil the principles of the world, and both are accomplished students of famed masters, aligning themselves with one another and working together is perfectly normal.Mona staunchly defends her teacher's image in front of Albedo.However, she also often complains about "that old hag.""You speak of your illustrious lineage, yet you also refer to your master as a "hag" and a "stubborn dimwit." Which of these descriptions is accurate?"Albedo could not help but ask this question — and when he did, Mona promptly realized that she had never given it much thought herself.Stroking her chin, she pondered this paradox deeply for a moment, before responding:"Hmph. The techniques passed down to me are exceptional, of course, but my teacher is not my equal.Does she know the market rates for eggs, butter, or wheat? In this regard, I have already far surpassed her."Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
During her apprenticeship, Mona found that the subtle abstractions of her master's teachings could explain the laws that governed the existence of all things.Human hearts were guided by these laws, and if one had great enough powers of calculation, all the mysteries of the world could be understood.Mona once believed this to be true.But when she had to strike out on her own and live day-to-day, she found herself doubting.Not everyone lived wealthy and comfortable lives. Some neither had food nor warm clothes, living no differently from beggars.And it was just such an adventurer who, when meeting Mona while she was out looking for fruits and vegetables to fill her stomach, shared half their food with her."Out here, we've gotta have each other's backs."This was not something inscribed on these so-called principles of the world. And many other such things she encountered on her journey — the honesty of a thief, a robber's change of heart, a coward's courage, the good deeds of a wicked person...Mona began to have some doubts, but she also felt like she finally had her feet on solid ground.When she was again alone with her thoughts under the stars, she marveled that her research had been so full of holes.Perhaps she would have to continue researching the world's principles for the rest of her life.All Things Astrological Friendship Lv. 4
The Court of Fontaine's mainline newspaper, The Steambird, has many a featured section that contains all sorts of news and gossip drawn from every corner of the seven nations.The section Mona contributes to is known as "All Things Astrological," and it is a column specifically targeted at hobbyists and professionals. That she had this opportunity at all was pure chance.When the previous contributing author was traveling the world, he heard tell of a strange astrologist, and his hobbyist's curiosity compelled him to seek her out.Their correspondence left him deeply impressed.As it happened, he was also looking to retire, and seeing that Mona was strapped for Mora, reached out to help her by recommending her to the editor-in-chief of The Steambird.When Mona released her first column, "An Introduction to Astrology," the column, heretofore known for being easy reading, experienced a massive shift in tone.Most of each issue was dedicated to discussing the movement of celestial bodies and other difficult (and obscure) topics. Academic quotations, dense footnotes and even the occasional hand-drawn star maps abounded in these writings.The editor-in-chief could not help but feel worried that this approach was too academic. Would it find acceptance with long-time readers? As it turned out, there was no need to fret. The publishing house received a great many letters that read something like this:"Wow, this is amazing. I don't really get it, but this is super interesting. Consider me a fan of Astrologist Mona Megistus."After getting approval to continue submitting manuscripts, Mona could finally heave a sigh of relief.Now, how best to celebrate... Ah yes. Perhaps she should use her first paycheck to purchase that latest-edition planetarium she'd had her eye on for a while now...Vision Friendship Lv. 6
To Mona, that her Vision was sent to her from the gods doesn't mean a great deal.This is not to say that possessing an external focus for elemental power is not useful.Having power is always a good thing, but when compared to lofty "truth," "martial prowess" is such a pathetically small concept.The gods, too, are bound by the rules of this world. Mona seeks the final truth of the world, hidden amidst the sea of stars.As such, she does not have any reverence for her Vision, which the people of this world consider to be a sign of divine favor and the source of all power.Nonetheless, this item that serves no practical use in her hands is something that she treasures greatly.It was gifted to her by her teacher as a teaching aid, and it is the only evidence of their time together as master and pupil.She preserves these distant memories with great care. This exquisitely-made teaching aid thus accompanied her everywhere, like an accessory worn by any other maiden.Until one day, when a Vision of her very own would quietly indwell this old teaching aid...

Trivia
Mona is the first 5-star character to use a Catalyst as a weapon.
Mona is one of the few currently playable characters who acknowledges (or even seems aware) that the Traveler is from another world. She was able to find this out through her astrology.
Mona is one of the characters with ornaments that glow. While wearing her default outfit, Flowing Fate, or her alternate outfit, Pact of Stars and Moon, when Mona's Elemental Burst is ready, the red parts of the ornaments on her hat, leg, and pigtails will glow along with her Vision.
Mona is able to use her astrology to ascertain and avoid danger, and she claims it allows her to "see through lies."
In her Story Quest, "Beyond This World's Stars," she is able to recognize a group of what appears to be traveling merchants looking for travelers to accompany, but actually are a group of bandits looking for tired travelers to rob.
In "What the Skies Conceal, the Water Reveals," she realizes Scaramouche is actually one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers and seeks to kill the Traveler. While Mona says that "even a junior astrologist would have seen through him instantly," Scaramouche himself seems surprised that she uncovered his true identity.
In one of Mona's idle animations, the constellation she views will randomly be Lepus (Amber's), Tempus Fugit (Lisa's), or Leo Minor (Jean's). The constellations she looks at are mirrored from her point of view, which is likely because she uses hydromancy as her method of astrology — looking at the night sky through its reflection in water.
What Mona specializes in is catroptromancy (also known as captromancy or enoptromancy), a term derived from the Ancient Greek words: κάτοπτρον katoptron, "mirror," and μαντεία manteia, "divination." This type of divination consists in predicting someone's future or also discovering their past through the use of a mirror, or any surface that may reflect light, like water. This practice was common in Classical Greece and Ancient Rome.
There is a running gag where other characters find it hard to pronounce Mona's last name, "Megistus," from Goth to Kazuha and Xinyan. To English-speaking players, this gag may be difficult to understand since Megistus is not hard to pronounce, but in Chinese, it may be hard to pronounce 梅姬斯图斯 Méijīsītúsī, "Megistus".
The English "Hello" voice-over also downplays it since Mona only requires the Traveler to learn her name, while the Chinese voice-over has Mona require the Traveler to "say it all correctly in one go."
Mona is known by these aliases or titles:
Centennial Genius
Lady Megistus (by Fischl and Oz)
During the Summertime Odyssey event, after completing the The Ancient Azure Stars (Domain), the answer to the astral puzzle inside Mona's room is Mona's constellation.
Mona, along with Ningguang, are the only playable characters known to have revived Masterless Visions rather than receiving their own.
Mona was born in Mondstadt after her parents migrated to Dornman Port, and eventually traveled with Barbeloth before settling in Mondstadt City. She further clarifies that she is not Fontainian, with Paimon feeling relieved knowing she would not be affected by the prophecy of Fontaine.[4]
Mona took up her current surname Megistus when she became Barbeloth's apprentice.[4]
Mona is mentioned in the descriptions of the following 2 Furnishings: Tranquil Starlight Wood-Carved Hat: Diviner
Mona shares her Korean voice actress, Woo Jeong-sin, with Diona.
Etymology
Her name has several possible origins:
English name "Mona," which is derived from Gaelic "muadh" (noble).
Northern European name, an alternative form of "Monica."
Old English "mona" (moon), which possibly stemmed from her career as an astrologer.
From "Mona Lisa" with the first element derived from Italian "madonna," which means "my lady."
Her constellation, Astrolabos, is Latin for "The Astrolabe."
Her epithet "Megistus" may very well derive from the Ancient Greek adjective μέγιστος, which is the superlative of the adjective μέγας, which means "big, great."
Mona confirms that her surname generally means "great."[4]

HelloHelloMedia:VO_Mona Hello.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_Hello.ogg I am Astrologist Mona Megistus, meaning "The Great Astrologist Mona." If it is divination you seek from me, then I ask you respect my name by learning it wholly, here and now.
Chat: AstrologyChat: AstrologyMedia:VO_Mona Chat - Astrology.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_Chat_-_Astrology.ogg Divination is about precisely foretelling one's written destiny. Over-embellishing that fate only leads to misconception.
Chat: LifeChat: LifeMedia:VO_Mona Chat - Life.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_Chat_-_Life.ogg Astrologers must rid themselves of material desires. Only by ridding oneself of clutter can one see the true world around them.
Chat: FateChat: FateMedia:VO_Mona Chat - Fate.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_Chat_-_Fate.ogg Fate is called as such, for it cannot be changed, nor can it be reversed. It can only but be accepted.
When It RainsWhen It RainsMedia:VO_Mona When It Rains.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_When_It_Rains.ogg With rain this heavy, not only are the stars clouded, so too is my scryglass hazy.
When Thunder StrikesWhen Thunder StrikesMedia:VO_Mona When Thunder Strikes.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_When_Thunder_Strikes.ogg Which of the starry skies do these thunderbolts fall from?
When It SnowsWhen It SnowsMedia:VO_Mona When It Snows.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_When_It_Snows.ogg The pure waters of melted snow are optimal for hydromancy.
When the Sun Is OutWhen the Sun Is OutMedia:VO_Mona When the Sun Is Out.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_When_the_Sun_Is_Out.ogg One need not scry to know today's weather will be good.
Good MorningGood MorningMedia:VO_Mona Good Morning.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_Good_Morning.ogg Your arrival is untimely. The morning star has just waned... Breakfast? No, I—I've already eaten.
Good AfternoonGood AfternoonMedia:VO_Mona Good Afternoon.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_Good_Afternoon.ogg Noon is upon us, we should eat. Hm? I... I will have a salad, for simplicity is the way of the astrologer.
Good EveningGood EveningMedia:VO_Mona Good Evening.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_Good_Evening.ogg Nightfall has arrived. I will soon be able to begin my divination. Ah... Did I finish writing my astrology column last night...?
Good NightGood NightMedia:VO_Mona Good Night.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_Good_Night.ogg It's already so late, and I'm no further along on finishing tomorrow's astrology column. What? You're off to sleep? *sigh* I wish I could sleep now too...
About MonaAbout MonaMedia:VO_Mona About Mona.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_About_Mona.ogg The work of the astrologer is to show people what fate has in store for them, and that's exactly what I do. There will always be those, however, who are unable to accept what they are told.
About Us: WorkAbout Us: WorkMedia:VO_Mona About Us - Work.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_About_Us_-_Work.ogg Why do I write reports, rather than using my divination to earn Mora? I would never use hydromancy for the sake of Mora, nor did I learn hydromancy for that purpose.
About Us: My Fate Friendship Lv. 6About Us: My Fate Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Mona About Us - My Fate.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_About_Us_-_My_Fate.ogg I don't know. Unless left with no other choice, astrologers do not foretell their own fate. The elders of my art warned against it, for it can turn fate in on itself, which is incredibly dangerous.
About Us: Your Fate Friendship Lv. 6About Us: Your Fate Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Mona About Us - Your Fate.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_About_Us_-_Your_Fate.ogg As you are not from this world, I am unable to give you a prediction. All I can tell you is that your journey is far from over.

And yet this thing does nothing for my hydromancy, all it does is get me wet.
About the Vision: Value Friendship Lv. 5About the Vision: Value Friendship Lv. 5Media:VO_Mona About the Vision - Value.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_About_the_Vision_-_Value.ogg That said, a Vision doesn't hurt to have as a little accessory. It is, after all, the one useful study tool that miserly old lady ever gave me, in a rare act of generosity.
Something to Share Friendship Lv. 6Something to Share Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Mona Something to Share.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_Something_to_Share.ogg Do you know about constellations? Astrologers believe that the patterns of the stars map out the destiny of Vision bearers — past, present, and future, everything is written in the stars.
Interesting Things Friendship Lv. 4Interesting Things Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Mona Interesting Things.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_Interesting_Things.ogg This... travel companion of yours — do you know anything of her origins? No matter what, I cannot seem to discern a single shred of information regarding this floating fairy's fate. ...Oh? So you don't know where she comes from, either?
About Jean Friendship Lv. 4About Jean Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Mona About Jean.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_About_Jean.ogg You mean the Acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius? Her constellation is Leo Minor, which represents strength and responsibility shouldered too young... Though the lioness has been separated from her pride for a long time, she grows from strength to strength, and the day will come when she is ready to return as its glorious leader.
About Albedo Friendship Lv. 4About Albedo Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Mona About Albedo.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_About_Albedo.ogg Albedo? Ah... I envy his ability to solely focus on his research without getting bogged down in mundane worldly affairs. What a wonderful life! If that batty old lady hadn't had one too many screws loose, perhaps that's the life I'd be living by now myself...
About Klee Friendship Lv. 4About Klee Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Mona About Klee.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_About_Klee.ogg Ah yes, Alice's daughter. She's in the custody of the Knights of Favonius, and Albedo looks after her too. She's blessed to have Trifolium as her constellation, which represents good luck. I'm slightly envious... *smirk*Although, if I'd been blessed with good luck, I suppose I never would have had the great honor of running into that old woman, would I...
About Diluc Friendship Lv. 4About Diluc Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Mona About Diluc.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_About_Diluc.ogg Diluc Ragnvindr. His constellation, Noctua, represents vigilance in the darkness of night... A lone guardian keeping watch, longing for the splendor of dawn, yet destined to solitude in the dark days preceding its arrival....Or, wait, maybe Noctua's the one tied to wealth...?
About Kaeya Friendship Lv. 4About Kaeya Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Mona About Kaeya.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_About_Kaeya.ogg Kaeya Alberich? He's a Pavo Ocellus. Destined for greatness and grandeur... and to hide ugly realities behind a layer of charm and elegance. He believes he has made a clean break with his past, but one day fate will catch up with him. When it does, he will have a major decision to make.
About Lisa Friendship Lv. 4About Lisa Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Mona About Lisa.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_About_Lisa.ogg A Tempus Fugit... The constellation derives its name from the hourglass, and stands for knowledge and time — or rather, the trade-off between them. As each grain of sand falls down, a moment of time — of life, even, dies for good. To stop the unrelenting flow of sand, one would have to turn the hourglass on its side. But once the sand comes to rest, it remains motionless forever... Hmm, maybe "becomes lazy" is more accurate than "comes to rest," in this case.
About Venti Friendship Lv. 4About Venti Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Mona About Venti.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_About_Venti.ogg Venti? The bard that sits around doing nothing all day? What's so interesting about him? Sure, I guess I can take a look...Huh, that's weird, the scryglass, it's... I can't see a thing... this wind... I can't... open my eyes! No, my hat! Ah! My clothes, stop! The wind's going to strip all my clothes off! Make it stop, make it stop! ...Alright, alright! I'll never do this again!

I don't usually have spare time for such activities, especially when I have so many columns left to write... Then again, since it's you, it might be worth it. Hehe, a change of pace once in a while isn't such a bad thing.
More About Mona: II Friendship Lv. 3More About Mona: II Friendship Lv. 3Media:VO_Mona More About Mona - 02.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_More_About_Mona_-_02.ogg Income? From astrology...? You can't use... things like Mora to determine the value of astrology! You need to understand: hydromancy is the one and only means of discerning people's true destiny in the whole of Teyvat! No matter how much Mora or gems you might have, the value of fate is quite simply incalculable! Perhaps not the smartest question you might have had for me...
More About Mona: III Friendship Lv. 4More About Mona: III Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Mona More About Mona - 03.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_More_About_Mona_-_03.ogg You want me to explain how astrology works? I'm not sure you'd understand even if I told you. But since you ask... The method I use is called hydromancy. The art of inferring fate from the illusory reflection of the stars on the water's surface. The inverted reflection in the water is an image of the heavens from within which the truth of our world can be observed. ...It is the one and only success story of that old lady's research endeavors.
More About Mona: IV Friendship Lv. 5More About Mona: IV Friendship Lv. 5Media:VO_Mona More About Mona - 04.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Mona_More_About_Mona_-_04.ogg Mona Megistus, the Astrologist — we came up with that name together, the old lady and me. She said it had a nice ring to it... But then she started calling me 'Meg' for short, which is obviously unnecessary, because clearly 'Mona' is already suffice for a shorter name— No! You are NOT allowed to call me that, it's embarrassing! Gah! I knew I shouldn't have told you!

In this all-too-real world in which we live, we all need to look up from the dust once in a while and fix our gaze on the stars, in a spirit of wonder... That, plus the whole thing about me being an astrologer.

Also, I still need to renew my journal subscriptions, not to mention pay the rent... Hmm, which one to prioritize? ...Ah, I'll pay off the celestial globe first. If I leave it any longer, they'll sell out, and then I'll never get my hands on one...

Dialogue

Media:vo mona mimitomo hello 01.ogg Mona: Huh? Looking for me at this hour of the day... This falls outside of my predictions.
Media:vo mona mimitomo hello 02.ogg Mona: Ahem... Is something the matter?
 How do you like it here?
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Mona: Of course! The conditions and facilities are first-class, and it's very comfortable here.
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Mona: So comfortable that... I'm a bit worried that it might be hard to adjust once I leave.
 Then... shouldn't you leave before it's too late?
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship1 03a.ogg Mona: Wh—What? No! Are you serious?
 There goes the Great Astrologist's pride...
 You can stay forever.
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship1 03b 1.ogg Mona: R—Really?
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship1 03b 2.ogg Mona: Being able to live in such a wonderful place without having to pay rent... Am I dreaming?
 There goes the Great Astrologist's pride...
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Mona: Huh?
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Mona: Why you...! Hmph... since you're letting me stay here for free, I'll let that pass...
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Mona: Hmm... Let me think of a way to repay you somehow.
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship1 07.ogg Mona: This way, we won't be indebted to each other.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Mona: Alright, I'm in good spirits. Is there anything you wish to know?
 I want to hear some of your knowledge!
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Mona: Oh... how studious of you.
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Mona: I am indisputably an erudite scholar, for my learning encompasses the stars above and earth below.
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Mona: ...But it would consume a considerable amount of time to explain the tenets of astrology...
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Mona: For now, some practical advice will do!
 Oh? Like what?
 You seem to have a lot of life experience...
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship2 06b.ogg Mona: Well, of course!
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Mona: Hmm... For instance, ingredients approaching their expiration date can be used to create very cost-effective meals as long as you thoroughly cook them with the appropriate cooking methods.
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Mona: Many stores have monthly sales. Find an opportune time to stock up on grains and dried foods. As staple foods, they will keep you feeling full for a long time.
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Mona: Also... Processing your own meat products is much cheaper than buying them ready-made.
 Your knowledge is all about saving money...
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship2 10a 1.ogg Mona: Ah...! Huh!
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship2 10a 2.ogg Mona: How impolite of you to generalize it as such!
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship2 10a 3.ogg Mona: These techniques are all a crucial element of living a disciplined life. They are the result of refinement of the objective laws of the world.
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship2 10a 4.ogg Mona: S—So I'll be stricter with you. You need to be more disciplined if you are to understand this world's truths!
 Got it!
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship2 10b 1.ogg Mona: Heh, you will understand how useful these are once you try.
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship2 10b 2.ogg Mona: After you have mastered these, I will impart more of the secret wonders hidden deep within this world.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
 Anything you'd like to do?
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Mona: Hmm, I want to reserve some of your spare time. Let's go on a vacation together.
 A... A vacation?
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Mona: Maybe on an uninhabited island or in a quiet rainforest, just somewhere we can put work aside and relax for a bit.
 This doesn't sound like you...
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship3 03a 1.ogg Mona: Is that so...? Hey, you don't just think of me as some research-obsessed maniac with a one-track mind, do you?
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship3 03a 2.ogg Mona: Everything I do is to comprehend the truths of the world... Even a vacation is a way to meet this end.
 Do you have funds for this...?
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship3 03b.ogg Mona: Hehe, I've already prepared them, of course.
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Mona: I started preparing for this a long time ago.
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Mona: Saving money can be difficult, so I specially prepared a savings jar. Every time I received a payment, I put aside some of it.
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Mona: During this time, I also resisted buying hardcover copies of research manuscripts... Eventually, I had saved up enough.
 That must've been hard...
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship3 07a.ogg Mona: Hehe, it's alright, it was worth it!
 Then I'll go set aside some time.
 I can't use your money.
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship3 07b 1.ogg Mona: Huh? What do you mean by that?
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship3 07b 2.ogg Mona: Thanks for being considerate, but this is something I want to do, so it really is fine.
 Then I'll go set aside some time.
Media:vo mona mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Mona: Okay! I'll await your word.
(Between 6:00 and 19:00)
 Good morning, Mona.
Media:vo mona mimitomo morning 01.ogg Mona: Oh, good morning.
Media:vo mona mimitomo morning 02.ogg Mona: If you need anything, I'll make time for you. Call me if there is something you can't resolve.
(Between 19:00 and 6:00)
 Good night, Mona.
Media:vo mona mimitomo night 01.ogg Mona: It's already time for you to turn in? If you ask me, there's never enough time in a day.
Media:vo mona mimitomo night 02.ogg Mona: Good night, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Yes, go replenish your strength.

Special Dialogue
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.

Amidst Poetic Pondering

Media:vo mimitomo md mona study 01.ogg Mona: ...Quite the dignified study. May I use it as well?
Media:vo mimitomo md mona study 02.ogg Mona: In that case, I hope you don't mind if I stack all the star maps I bought over here.
Media:vo mimitomo md mona study 03.ogg Mona: Hmm... I still have those things I bought on sale. If I want to maximize my use of space, I'll need to plan this out more carefully.

Cottage Kitchen

Media:vo mimitomo md mona kitchen 01.ogg Mona: Let me quickly inspect the ingredients in the kitchen...
Media:vo mimitomo md mona kitchen 02.ogg Mona: After all, you will most certainly need wisdom to turn limited ingredients into a dish that can keep you full for an entire day.
Media:vo mimitomo md mona kitchen 03.ogg Mona: Oh yes, thank you for preparing these! If you're not averse, you're welcome to try some as well.
