Personality
The owner of Chioriya Boutique. A tailor renowned throughout Fontaine.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Chiori is a famous fashion designer from Inazuma who is currently running Chioriya Boutique in Fontaine and is one of the Komaniya Express's regular customers. She left Inazuma when the Vision Hunt Decree and Sakoku Decree was enacted and has not returned since. Chiori usually speaks in a blunt, straightforward manner, which can take some time to get used to. Her methods of resolving disputes can be considered radical, as she does not like wasting her time on explanations. She is also particularly prideful with her clothes[2] and even scolding Lyney on one occasion when his outfit got damaged.[3] However, if the situation calls for it, she does not mind having them damaged and/or destroyed.
In her youth, Chiori was often a troublemaker and considers herself spoiled by her parents. In one instance, she even snuck into the Kamisato Estate.[4][5] She developed an interest in needlework and shows immense skill, thus resulting in her parents sending her to a master tailor to refine her craft. However, she soon came to learn and despise arrogant higher-ups, thus resulting in incidents that made her leave Inazuma for Fontaine. Her Geo Vision showcases her determination to follow her own path without succumbing to outside influences.
After an encounter while delivering a package to her, Chiori made Kirara's current outfit, Whirling Bloom, after being displeased with her appearance at the time, which she described as akin to being "unceremoniously dropped in a bucket of paint". This resulted in her store becoming more known as people inquired about the outfit.[2][6][7] She also tailored the outfits worn by Lyney, Lynette, and Navia, as well as the accessories for Charlotte's Kamera, Monsieur Verite. Chiori is very popular among the people of Fontaine, ranging from the upper classes to even muscle men who treat her with respect and gifts; anyone who disrespects her are promptly thrown out of her store.[8] While people are willing to pay for her clothes, Chiori is not particularly driven by wealth, rather being more interested in increasing the reputation of her name and store.[9]
Chiori is good friends with Chevreuse, though her hard-handed methods to solving problems often leaves Chevreuse exasperated. She is also good friends with Navia, as the two young women share similarities with each other. It is also implied that she does not like competition in the fashion industry, as she quickly drives out malignant competitors[10] and had nearly done the same when she was learning the trade in Inazuma.

Official Introduction
Couturiere of Countless Colors
Chiori's really good with her hands! Whenever I try on a new outfit, she always does up my hair too — it's all part of the package, she says! Hehe, I just love it when she brushes my fur...—Kirara
On the busiest street in Fontaine's Quartier Lyonnais lies a clothing store called "Chioriya Boutique." Though it may seem unassumingly small, you'll notice that passersby often stop to peer in. People say that its boss Chiori hails from Inazuma, and that she is as direct as a bolt of lightning. They know what happens to those who insist on interfering with her business, having witnessed the fallout with their own eyes. Not only do such meddlers invariably end up tasting the bitterness of defeat, but some of them — for the very first time in their lives — learn what it feels like to be thrown backside-first into the gutter... literally.
What sort of background and upbringing gives a foreign fashion designer the confidence to act so boldly? This is the question that local journalists ask one another when they hear or witness such spectacles, their eyes wide with amazement. They're constantly on the hunt for anecdotes that might shed some light on her past, some even having traveled all the way to Inazuma to secretly interview her friends, family, and former tailoring mentor...
Obstinate, headstrong, and disobedient from a young age, even daring to forgo honorifics when addressing her elders... overall, not a particularly positive picture.
Chiori's parents alone would let out a smile, saying that she just has "a unique way of thinking" and is "single-mindedly devoted to the pursuit of her dreams."
"Miss Chiori, may I ask... How did you manage to achieve such success? And what are the secrets to designing such wonderful clothes?"
Sitting opposite, Chiori began to put away her needle and thread as she stared coldly back at this journalist masquerading as a customer.
"I make whatever I wish to, however I wish to. How about you then — are you planning to buy anything or not?"

Character Details
You push open the doors to the boutique. Situated on one of Fontaine's busiest thoroughfares, it is named for its designer.The crisp ringing of a bell chimes from above as if wishing luck to all customers who step through the door. If the rumors swirling about have even a grain of truth to them, then perhaps such blessings will come in handy."Welcome to the Chioriya Boutique, how may I help you?" The greeting that reaches your ears, while perhaps lacking somewhat in enthusiasm, is filled with assurance.The owner of the voice shoots you a glance from behind the counter. A striking foreigner with captivating eyes — just like they said."A personalized, custom job? Or something off the shelf?" Her second question. The tone fills you with a certain feeling — as though the second someone steps through the door, even the highest-ranking aristocrat becomes merely a guest in her kingdom, while she sits high upon her throne, allowing supplicants to choose from among the blessings she offers."I'd like tailor-made formal attire." You say. Her expression softens a little. It appears that in this kingdom, customizing the cut of the cloth to the customer and designing a personalized outfit in the Kingdom's name is something worth a smile.Perhaps this is the best possible outcome, you muse to yourself. After all, those who recommended the shop to you not only all praised the exquisite handiwork of this designer, but some nearly couldn't stop themselves from opening wide their wardrobes to show off the dazzling contents within, as though they wished nothing more than to shove you inside to bask in the clothes' glory for a day. They even say that the owner of the shop is rarely found within, and if she is on the premises, that means she is in a good mood.But you quietly swallow all the same, for you know when fortune does not hold you in her fickle favor, then all manner of unimaginable and outrageous things may occur when the owner is in, such as...Before you can even get a handle on your thoughts and feelings, the bell above the door screams a metallic protest. The boutique's door has been kicked wide open by a man swaying and rocking, foul breath reeking of alcohol and language yet more foul spilling out of his mouth."I—I won! I won the bet, the Boss is in toda—" Though you could not clearly see just what happened, before he even finished speaking, he suddenly flew out the window, drawing an elegant arc through the air.Chiori brushes her hands and closes the window, before saying to you, as if nothing had happened, "Apologies, the weather has been somewhat inclement of late. All kinds of trash have come blowing into my shop. It's been taken care of, so pay it no heed."It appears this kingdom does not welcome all unconditionally.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
"Ms. Chiori, what past experiences did you have that forged the success you now enjoy?" — A reporter once asked her this question.Chiori had hesitated as she searched for an appropriate response in her memories, but simply could not find a good answer. After all, in her own estimation, there was nothing special at all about her past.Chiori was born into a family of merchants. Though not well-off by any means, she had lacked for nothing in her childhood. Busy with their business, her parents had not been overly strict with her. This, her parents joked, is what had created her carefree and unbridled nature.At the age when many young girls began to study the art of tea or of flowers, Chiori was climbing trees and catching fish with other children... It wasn't that her parents never tried to get her to learn. But making Chiori sit quietly in front of a tea table for an entire day? Why, that would be the death of her (and of her teacher).—Alright, then let's just have her study the art of the sword, said her father.Before long, Chiori was carrying two swords with her to class. "Two is obviously better," she declared, boldly and confidently, dual blades in hand.Her teacher had never seen a student with — his words to her father were tactfully chosen — such personality. And thus a seething Chiori was sent back home.Similar scenes played out many times, yet Chiori's parents were never too harsh with her, only believing "That's just how she is."Until one day, Chiori's mother came home to discover her sitting quietly before the table, staring entranced at a bolt of high-quality fabric. The Chiori that was normally bouncing off the walls was nowhere to be found."Do you like it?" Asked her mother. "It feels so smooth," came little Chiori's blunt answer, "And it's so pretty, how was it made?"And thus, in the days that followed, Chiori sent tailoring teacher after teacher storming off in frustration, just as before. But at the same time, she also learned many tailoring techniques.Also, in all fairness, it should be mentioned that Chiori was already far more well-behaved with the tailors than she had been with all those other teachers.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
When the news of Inazuma's Sakoku policy reached Fontaine, the topics of tea-table discussions centered around the "Raiden Shogun" over there, that "Vision Hunt Decree," and those ceaseless thunderstorms on the islands, as though discussing some sort of fantastical anecdotes.After all, even the loudest thunderclap cannot be heard across the vastness of the sea to the dome of the sky above their heads.But the people of Fontaine could never have imagined that a storm that would imminently engulf Fontaine had at that time already left the shores of Inazuma, and was quietly heading for them. And the name of that storm was "Chiori."The storm took shape on the journey out of Inazuma. From the very beginning, it had decided to let loose its thunder upon the streets of Fontaine — the capital of fashion and the City of the Arts.At first, it was only a few rumblings from the diverse firmament of the fashion world that nobody paid much heed to."It's just a fad, that's all," "It'll be forgotten in a few days"... That's what they all said at first, as though they were discussing nothing more than a cat of unusual coloration that had appeared on the streets.Yet after this storm named "Chiori" struck that year's Fontaine Fashion Week, nearly all could hear the echoes of its thunderous fury reverberating throughout Fontaine.In a flash, the headlines of Fontaine's papers were completely occupied with a foreign name.Some critics have opined that quality clothes are not just for looking at, but can also be "heard." In this aspect, Chiori had succeeded. Every stitch and thread of her clothes told a story: the echoes of waves, the breathing of a forest, a sweet spring gushing forth in the desert...Naturally, the "old guard" of the fashion world could not tolerate this foreign interloper encroaching upon their territory, and thus raised their banners and declared war upon this "invader," using various methods.Yet everyone can see how it ended. Not only did they taste the bitterness of defeat, but some of them — for the first time in their lives — tasted the feeling of falling butt-first into the gutter.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
It is unclear when the Chioriya Boutique gained the nickname of "intelligence boutique." Even Chiori herself is at a bit of a loss as to how this occurred. It's almost as if all she needs to do is share some of the information she has overheard in her shop with her friends, and it will have a tremendous impact on certain matters.Later, she came to understand that rather than the Chioriya Boutique being the source of reams of intelligence, it was better to say that rivers of intelligence flowed of their own accord through her doors.Those impeccably dressed merchants and government dignitaries were a kaleidoscopic flock of butterflies, each scattering the pollen known as "intelligence" from their fluttering wings onto that gorgeous flower called the Chioriya Boutique. Their actual intention was not to pollinate this flower, but rather to flaunt just how much pollen they had to the other butterflies. They consider the amount of information one had on them to be far more worthy of taking pride in than the quantity of gems sewn into one's garments.—Have you heard? So-and-so has yet another new flame!—Oh, and that one, they seem to have sealed a huge deal with the one from the Maison Gardiennage!—You mean the one in charge of transportation? Now I've heard that what he's really transporting is...—Shh! You can't say that out loud!...If she really had to choose, Chiori would rather not listen to all this. She feels allergic to this sort of pollen, with the primary symptom being difficulty in quietly and wholeheartedly focusing on clothing. Thus, when designing new styles and products, she generally does not show up in her shop.But after realizing the value of such intelligence, she began to take a certain amount of notice on behalf of others. Should the interests of friends or the safety of Fontaine be involved, she would kindly send a letter to give a friendly reminder, or do so to their face. For her, this is no different from tailoring clothes — sewing each element into its proper place.In accordance with a businessperson's principles, Chiori naturally collects some small tokens of "repayment." After all, as she is wont to say: It's only business if there's an exchange.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
If you truly wish to understand Chiori's designs, then you must witness Chiori fashioning clothes with your own eyes.The first time people see said designs, it's as if they cannot comprehend what is before them. Does this designer not know what "rules" are? How can women's clothes be tailored like men's? How can men's formalwear use women's fabrics?Yet there is some quality within that attracts them, and halts them in their tracks. It's as if all of this rejection and resistance to the "rules" is so eminently reasonable that it is plainly saying: You are the ones who are wrong.It is the same for Chiori as she tailors the clothes. From the way she treats the fabric, it is as if she has never seen the material before. Her cuts come from unexpected angles, ignoring the direction of the thread, and sometimes suddenly seizing upon adding a completely new structure halfway through, before upending her own work once again...Sometimes, she will even draw her sword and swiftly cut the first-rate fabric before her with a clean slash, as though she were not making clothes, but rather dueling — as though she were fighting with the fabric in her hands, vying for authority, with her emerging as the ultimate victor.No one makes clothes as she does, much less converses so with the fabric. Her workstation becomes an operating table, and she knows just what the perfect form of the fabric is, with each stroke of her blade excising lesions and sores from her patient...An employee once complained to Chiori that it was too difficult to cut the style she requested.—"Why? Are your scissors not sharp enough?"—"No, that's not it... It's just..."—"Then you can cut it."She will make you feel that if you cannot cut and trim clothes exactly as you please, then that is because you're simply too foolish to do so. Yet when you see the clothes she tailors, you will feel that if you cannot live exactly as you please, then that is yet more foolish still."Ms. Chiori, I would like to ask, just how do you design your clothes?" —Came the reporter's question.—"However I want."Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Dreams. Such an ephemeral word, far flimsier than even the thinnest silks Chiori has laid hands on. Yet when worn, they can be heavier and more suffocating than the thickest fabric.She chased her dream all the way to Fontaine, and yet when she finally managed to catch up to it, she discovered that it had once more run even farther away of its own accord.So, what next? Take up the burden of her dream and forge ahead, or just be content with what she had?—No. Chiori firmly told herself. I choose neither.She enjoyed the sweet aftertaste dreams left, the satisfaction that filled her. Yet she hated using dreams of the future to urge herself onward. That was itself a kind of shackle.She chooses to live in the present.She will work tirelessly day and night on a piece of clothing, just so that it might grace the stage of Fashion Week. She will also disappear for weeks on a whim, enjoying every sight along the way, the starry sky overhead every night, until finally setting off on the road back home once tired. It all depends on her mood.None can dictate any aspect of her life to her, no one can tell her what she "should" do; not even her own dreams. It is almost as if she would toss life itself out the window without a moment's hesitation, should it prove an obstacle to her."Never give up" is Chiori's true brand. She has said so herself.Strangely, it's as though it is in fact her "dream" that has begun actively trying to draw close to her out of fright. As opposed to her chasing it, her dream is attempting to curry favor with her, like a once-wild tamed beast attempting to cozy up to its new master's side.—Ms. Chiori, you've said that you want your brand to become fashionable across Teyvat. May I ask when you expect to achieve this goal?—Hard to say. Perhaps when I feel like it.Chiori's Drafts Friendship Lv. 4
When a Snow-Winged Goose chasing the reflection of the moon leapt into the lake, Chiori awoke. She blinked and yawned, gazing at the black evening dress glittering like the star-studded heavens. The shadows of her dream were melting in her mind, leaving inky traces of sadness."Scissors, please." She pushed herself into a sitting position as her loyal assistant appeared by her side, handing Chiori the tool in her hand."And a pencil." She added, and "Tamoto" pulled out a pencil that seemed to have seen quite some use from who knows where.When seeking inspiration, Chiori prefers solitude to company, and often sets off on her own with little more than the clothes on her back, disliking burdening herself with this and that.A notebook is something that nags at her, as though begging her to write something down. A map is too confining, as though seeking to draw lines and boundaries through her empire of fashion without her say-so.Her drafts are harder to understand than those of any other designer in the business, for they are often drawn on menus, leaves, or even her own clothing...Yet her finished products are also more breathtaking than those of any other designer, as they are the distillation of the scenery she has seen, the characters she has met, and even those melted remnants of dreams..."Done." She looked at the newspaper before her — or more precisely, the tattered remnants thereof — and nodded in satisfaction. She didn't even remember how she had picked it up today, but that was irrelevant.Her drafts are born with such spontaneity, and completed with the same free and easy spirit: They are brought back to the Chioriya Boutique, copied out onto the toile, and then turned into tea-stained taiyaki wrapping paper before finally being laid to rest in the garbage.And as for the essence of the drafts... They are for customers to admire and acclaim, and for being enshrined on the front page of fashion magazines.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
No way forward. Nothing left to do.Chiori lay prone before the table, eyebrows knitting at her first work. "Tamoto" said nothing, as though sleeping — or perhaps it was that she had simply never awoken. Chiori's habit was to use a small amount of cloth to try out her designs on Tamoto before making an outfit. Should the result prove satisfactory, she would then copy the design onto a full-size model. Yet none of her designs had been able to gain the approval of her teacher.Not long before, yet another teacher had expelled her. She had gradually come to understand that sometimes, it wasn't that her teachers disliked her designs, but that they simply didn't dare to be the first to adopt such designs. The judgmental gaze of others were threads far harder to snip than the stitches of any clothes."And what do you think?" She asked the puppet in front of her. "Tamoto" had never complained about her designs, and would happily try on any clothes without protest. But if she could open her mouth, would she say those three words, "I like it"?Not long before, Ogura Textiles & Kimonos had extended an invitation to Chiori, asking her to work in the shop. Chiori appreciated Ogura Mio's intentions, for among the children studying tailoring, she was one who seemed to admire Chiori's designs.But no. Chiori shook her head, rejecting the idea.When all was said and done, that was someone's else shop, someone else's name. She didn't like the feeling of dwelling within the home of another."Fontaine..." She whispered softly. The word had been bubbling to the surface of her mind of late, as a hummed tune overheard may linger forever in the ear, unforgettable.The books said that was the capital of fashion, a city of the arts. The merchants said it was a place that revered entertainment, and that anything interesting would be liked by everyone there.Then, Chiori had thought it too far away. It would take months of travel just to get there. Now, she felt that Inazuma was too far away. Her designs would reach few here."Fontaine... Fontaine..." She murmured the name several more times, as though doing so could pull that faraway country closer to her.As she thought of "Ogura Textiles & Kimonos," she found herself speaking another name — "Chioriya Boutique."—It was as though her heartstrings had suddenly been plucked and were now humming. The sounds of "Fontaine" and "Chioriya Boutique" were two notes that seemed to form a perfect harmonious chord."Fontaine's 'Chioriya Boutique'..." She closed her eyes and imagined a sign emblazoned with her name appearing on Fontaine's vibrant avenues, and how the people there would sound speaking the strange name. It suddenly all seemed so real to her, as though, at that moment, the real her was already in Fontaine, and the "her" left here was merely a shadow she had carelessly left behind in Inazuma.She swiftly sat up and left the house without so much as a word to her parents. They were shocked, and looked at each other in dismay, guessing that perhaps she was going out for a walk to unwind. Yet when she next returned, she had already said her goodbyes to some, and left a few others with no doubt as to what she really thought of them. Either way, the name "Chiori" would certainly return to Inazuma's shores long before she did. That was the oath she swore."I'm leaving tomorrow," She said to her parents. That melody humming internally was urging her forward, and she had to go chase the her that was in Fontaine.Her mother looked at her father reproachfully, as if to say "Of all the traits she inherited, it had to have been your personality."Naturally, her parents didn't try to stop her, as they knew very well that once this child said something, it was already set in stone.As Chiori returned to her room to pack her things, the items on her table suddenly shifted, startling her."Tamoto" slowly turned in circles, as though showing off the clothes Chiori had made for her, before happily floating over to Chiori— and in the puppet's outstretched hands was a brilliant Vision.

But luckily, Chiori offers a Melusine tailoring service, so now all my Melusine friends have the chance to wear the pretty clothes they love.

Title and RequirementsDetails
HelloHelloMedia:VO_Chiori Hello.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Hello.ogg I am Chiori, the owner of Chioriya Boutique. Feel free to find me if you'd like to commission any tailor-made outfits. As for any other requests, it all depends on whether you have enough to offer in exchange. Just the rules of the "business" — you scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours. Also, smoking, drinking, and causing a ruckus are all strictly prohibited within the Boutique. That whole "the customer is king" concept doesn't fly here... And even when royalty does come into the shop, if they don't adhere to the rules, they'll find themselves being tossed out and kissing the pavement just like anyone else.
Chat: CriticismChat: CriticismMedia:VO_Chiori Chat - Criticism.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Chat_-_Criticism.ogg It's up to me to decide who I want to be and to cut my own path. No one can tell me what to do.
Chat: Tailor's CuttersChat: Tailor's CuttersMedia:VO_Chiori Chat - Tailor's Cutters.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Chat_-_Tailor%27s_Cutters.ogg Who says you have to use scissors to cut clothes? Leave those rigid rules behind. I much prefer using my own cutting tools.
Chat: ModelingChat: ModelingMedia:VO_Chiori Chat - Modeling.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Chat_-_Modeling.ogg If you really like standing around like this, then why don't you just model for me? I'll design some wonderful clothes for you.
When It RainsWhen It RainsMedia:VO_Chiori When It Rains.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_When_It_Rains.ogg It's not so much the rain that bothers me, but the mud. It's always such a pain to wash it out of my clothes.
When Thunder StrikesWhen Thunder StrikesMedia:VO_Chiori When Thunder Strikes.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_When_Thunder_Strikes.ogg ...This reminds me of home.
When It SnowsWhen It SnowsMedia:VO_Chiori When It Snows.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_When_It_Snows.ogg The way it comes floating from on high makes you want to reach out for it... But the moment it lands on your hand, its beauty dissipates... Hmm, I suppose there are more similarities between snowflakes and fashion than I thought...
In the DesertIn the DesertMedia:VO_Chiori In the Desert.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_In_the_Desert.ogg Hmm, just how can I market high fashion here...
Good MorningGood MorningMedia:VO_Chiori Good Morning.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Good_Morning.ogg Morning. Don't expect me to make breakfast for you. But if you're going to the café, be a darling and bring me a cup of coffee. Black. No cream, no sugar.
Good AfternoonGood AfternoonMedia:VO_Chiori Good Afternoon.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Good_Afternoon.ogg Is it lunch time already? I'm not even hungry yet... I don't plan on taking a break now. You go ahead.
Good EveningGood EveningMedia:VO_Chiori Good Evening.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Good_Evening.ogg It's so noisy out there. Has everyone in the entire Court of Fontaine decided to go out this evening?
Good NightGood NightMedia:VO_Chiori Good Night.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Good_Night.ogg I'm going to go relax by taking a nice, long bath. Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
About Chiori: DirectnessAbout Chiori: DirectnessMedia:VO_Chiori About Chiori - Directness.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_About_Chiori_-_Directness.ogg Many have expressed displeasure both publicly and privately about my personality, and have complained that my words can be hurtful. But, if you ask me, all those showy pleasantries, greetings, and compliments are far more of a waste of everyone's time. If simply stating the facts seems hurtful, then perhaps they are too insecure.
About Chiori: Brand Vision Friendship Lv. 4About Chiori: Brand Vision Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chiori About Chiori - Brand Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_About_Chiori_-_Brand_Vision.ogg When I first started conceptualizing the idea of my brand, I reflected on many of my past experiences, and came up with a lot of phrases for the brand's slogan. It's difficult to pick only one phrase for the brand, especially when you realize that every word reflects on a deeply treasured part of yourself... but you can only choose that which best represents you."Never admit defeat." That's me. That's my brand.
About Us: FittingAbout Us: FittingMedia:VO_Chiori About Us - Fitting.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_About_Us_-_Fitting.ogg Take it from me — this one looks good on you. Hmm? You've never seen a style like this before? Aw, that's because you've never met a designer with taste before.
About Us: Exchange Friendship Lv. 6About Us: Exchange Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Chiori About Us - Exchange.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_About_Us_-_Exchange.ogg I know you probably already know this, but I always just say what's on my mind. Maybe you've already grown accustomed to it, but that's just how I express myself, and I'm not going to change. You should also always act like yourself around me — there's no need to hide anything. I promise I'll never criticize you for who you are. Hmm? Don't believe me? After all this time together, have you ever seen me not keep my word?
About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chiori About the Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_About_the_Vision.ogg Because I was born in Inazuma, the people of Fontaine have dubbed me "The Thundering Seamstress." If that's what they want to call me, then that's what they can call me. I have no lingering affection for my homeland. After all, everything, including my Vision, only came to me after I decided to leave Inazuma.Oh, but that's not to say that I actively dislike those islands where fabric never fully dries. It's just that I haven't found any reason to go back.
Something to ShareSomething to ShareMedia:VO_Chiori Something to Share.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Something_to_Share.ogg When I was a kid, my parents would send me to a variety of activities to help expend my energy. One such activity was learning the art of the sword. But after some time, I suddenly felt that a dual wielding technique was really strong and impressive. It wasn't long before the instructor approached me and told me to stop practicing using that technique. When I asked him why, all he said was that it wasn't the standard sword technique, and that it was "improper." After that, I never attended his class again. Now that I think about it, it's fortunate that I insisted on following the way I preferred. Perhaps I'm just the sort who needs to keep both my hands busy.
Interesting ThingsInteresting ThingsMedia:VO_Chiori Interesting Things.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Interesting_Things.ogg Tamoto is my first masterpiece. At the time, I was just thinking to stitch together a puppet girl who looked like me to be my model and assistant. Huh? What about a companion? No, I have no need for that.
About Navia Friendship Lv. 4About Navia Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chiori About Navia.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_About_Navia.ogg She used to beg me to help her design all kinds of strange things. For example, little crowns for every handle on a ship's helm... I couldn't help but roll my eyes at her request, and tell her that the most I would do is design her hat like a boat.Those who say I'm ahead of my time have clearly never spoken to her.
About Lyney Friendship Lv. 4About Lyney Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chiori About Lyney.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_About_Lyney.ogg I can't make a hat that could hide secrets, but it seems Lyney can enchant his hat to do just that... I'm a little curious about how it feels to wear a hat full of so many tricks and secrets like his. As for me, I don't need the burden of all that, it's easiest to just say what's on my mind.
About Lynette Friendship Lv. 4About Lynette Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chiori About Lynette.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_About_Lynette.ogg The magician's assistant sure doesn't say much, but I know she trusts me. You know, I sure get a lot of love from cats...
About Charlotte Friendship Lv. 4About Charlotte Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chiori About Charlotte.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_About_Charlotte.ogg One time, Charlotte came into the shop, hoping to do an interview with me. I told her there was no point, because there was nothing new to talk about. But just as she was leaving, a drunkard came stumbling into the shop and started causing trouble. She recorded the whole thing... What a fiasco. I've heard of journalists chasing leads, but now it seems news chases the journalists.
About Chevreuse Friendship Lv. 4About Chevreuse Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chiori About Chevreuse.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_About_Chevreuse.ogg Working with Chevreuse and talking with her are a cinch. So easy, in fact, that whenever I say goodbye to her and return to tending to my customers again, it takes me a moment to shift gears mentally.
About Emilie Friendship Lv. 4About Emilie Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chiori About Emilie.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_About_Emilie.ogg Emilie's perfumes are very popular. We have a business agreement where I ask her to deliver small quantities of perfume she's working on to Chioriya Boutique. I let Eloffe secretly spray the perfume in the fitting room, and then I'll let her know any feedback I get from the customers. Even after all this time, I've never once had a customer ever say that my fitting room smelled strange. In fact, they usually come one after another to ask where they can buy the fragrance. Out of curiosity, I always buy a bottle when she brings them to sell in her shop. I have to say that such fragrances which can always bring a sense of refreshment are truly works of art.
About Wriothesley Friendship Lv. 4About Wriothesley Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chiori About Wriothesley.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_About_Wriothesley.ogg Yes. Some of my friends and partners have mentioned him to me before. I admire his skills at management and diplomacy, but I certainly have no intention of changing my way of doing things.
About Kirara Friendship Lv. 4About Kirara Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chiori About Kirara.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_About_Kirara.ogg While I was still in Inazuma, there was a cat with green eyes that always liked to follow me whenever I went out into the wild in search of inspiration. The kitty seemed to be very interested in the colors and patterns of the fabric I was carrying. She would even come up and rub her head against my legs when she was in a good mood.Later, I recognized those green eyes again, but on a girl with two tails. The way she gazed at new and intriguing things still had not changed after so many years.
About Kamisato Ayaka Friendship Lv. 4About Kamisato Ayaka Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chiori About Kamisato Ayaka.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_About_Kamisato_Ayaka.ogg If I wasn't always slipping away to go play when I was a child, I probably would never have had the chance to meet the young lady of the Kamisato Clan. There was one time when I climbed my way into the Kamisato Clan's courtyard, and her Temari just happened to roll over towards the wall. I could tell that she was both surprised and happy to see me. We played together and chatted for quite some time, but I was discovered in the end. And so, our brief friendship came to an end as I was kicked off the premises.
More About Chiori: IMore About Chiori: IMedia:VO_Chiori More About Chiori - 01.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_More_About_Chiori_-_01.ogg I don't think my temper is as bad as people make it out to be. I just don't like wasting my time on trivial matters, that's all. But for some reason, it's always those trivial things that come back to haunt me. So, over time, I've ended up with a bad reputation. I would say that's completely unjust!

There was a period when I hated the rules, and would always insist on going against the grain. Thanks to this headstrong character of mine, I've had to go through a lot of suffering. But eventually, I came to understand that rules aren't completely a bad thing. What I really can't stand is the feeling that I can't make decisions based on what I truly think.
More About Chiori: III Friendship Lv. 4More About Chiori: III Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chiori More About Chiori - 03.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_More_About_Chiori_-_03.ogg When I was little, I used to always look forward to the summer festival in my hometown. Every year, people would take out the most vibrant and beautiful clothes, and carefully put them on before joining the crowd...Every time the festival came around, there'd be all of these brightly colored spheres hanging from people's belts, goldfish that you couldn't scoop up from the bowl no matter how hard you tried, apple candy so sweet that even the children couldn't finish them all, and fireworks so beautiful that they could have only come from the Naganohara house... I always had a lot of fun at such festivals, but even then, I would always feel like something was "missing" when I went home at the end of the night. It was only after I got much older that I realized I must have wanted to become more than just a spectator at such a wonderful event....It's just like how people will always associate the house of "Naganohara" with fireworks. I hope that one day, people will also associate festivals with Chioriya clothes.Hehe, just thinking about the prospect of that gets me really fired up. Alright, time to go back to the shop and churn out a few more designs.
More About Chiori: IV Friendship Lv. 5More About Chiori: IV Friendship Lv. 5Media:VO_Chiori More About Chiori - 04.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_More_About_Chiori_-_04.ogg Although I can get quite immersed in my work, I also enjoy living in the moment. When I have some free time, I would often pack some food and find a lovely place in nature to take a cozy midday nap, before returning home, relaxing some more, and then finally falling asleep to my favorite music. Oh, and other times, I like to go out for food with my friends, talk about everything that's happening in the world, and party until everyone's completely hammered. Honestly, it all just depends on what I feel like doing in the moment. Just as fashion only exists in the moment, I also love living in the moment. So, what do you think? Want to go out with me tonight and enjoy a whole night of fun?
More About Chiori: V Friendship Lv. 6More About Chiori: V Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Chiori More About Chiori - 05.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_More_About_Chiori_-_05.ogg I love Inazuma's petite desserts, as well as all culinary dishes subtle and light. Similarly, I also like the feel of my homeland's fabrics, as well as the practice of taking a bath after a long working day. But on the flip side, I also adore the soft waves of Fontaine's seas, as well as the beautiful scenery underneath the waters.Sometimes, I wonder if everything is in fact predestined, and if I'm still living in the shadow of my past. But then, another question always follows — would the answer to that really change anything? In any case, I'm still me, living in my present. Even if I'm only the way I am due to what has happened in my past, my future is still in my own hands, and no one in this world can really change that.
Chiori's HobbiesChiori's HobbiesMedia:VO_Chiori Hobbies.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Hobbies.ogg I'm pursuing my dream through my work, and exploring the meaning of freedom through my art. What's the point of spending years and years of your life over something that's not near and dear to your heart?
Chiori's Troubles Friendship Lv. 6Chiori's Troubles Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Chiori Troubles.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Troubles.ogg Sometimes, I worry that I haven't made as much progress as I'd hoped, and thus, it'd be hard to know when I would actually realize my dream of making Chioriya renowned throughout the world. Still, that's no reason to question or abandon the dream. Rather than worrying or doubting myself, my time would be better spent creating a few more designs.
Favorite FoodFavorite FoodMedia:VO_Chiori Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Favorite_Food.ogg I can never forget the Inazuman desserts I used to indulge in as a child. But rather than the joy of tasting them, I've always been more interested in the process of making them. Had I been less drawn to the fascinating world of fabrics and color, the world would have gained another dessert chef.
Least Favorite FoodLeast Favorite FoodMedia:VO_Chiori Least Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Least_Favorite_Food.ogg I can't handle food with particularly strong flavors, like Haggis, for example. The experience of eating it is kind of like... suddenly getting hit with a faceful of Geo Specter out of nowhere. Does that make sense to you?
Receiving a Gift: IReceiving a Gift: IMedia:VO_Chiori Receiving a Gift - 01.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Receiving_a_Gift_-_01.ogg Mm, I do love this dish. Why don't you bring me some more next time. Don't worry, I'll also bring a gift for you in return.
Receiving a Gift: IIReceiving a Gift: IIMedia:VO_Chiori Receiving a Gift - 02.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Receiving_a_Gift_-_02.ogg Not bad. I think this would be most enjoyable after a hard day's work in the shop.

BirthdayBirthdayMedia:VO_Chiori Birthday.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chiori_Birthday.ogg Yeah, yeah... Happy birthday, or whatever. Just tell me if there's a gift you like — I can't be bothered to try and guess what you want. Hm? Too direct? Alright then, why don't you grab Navia, Kirara, and the others, and maybe a few of your friends as well. We can have a party tonight at my place. I'll take some notes on the gifts that the others have prepared for you, and make you an accessory right then and there. Ten thousand mora that you'd like it. Haha, call it the confidence of the owner of Chioriya Boutique.

Dialogue[]

Media:vo chiori mimitomo hello 01.ogg Chiori: Ah, you're here, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). I sort of assumed that you didn't make it home very often.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo hello 02.ogg Chiori: So, how are the travels going? Anything exciting happen lately? Your stories might be just the inspiration I need.
 How do you like it here?
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Chiori: It's pretty good. Pleasant scenery, calm atmosphere... Good place to rest and rejuvenate your body and mind.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Chiori: Sometimes, when I get sick of being in the Court of Fontaine, I get a strong urge to head off somewhere else for a while, and get a change of scenery. Somewhere without unruly customers, or tabloids spreading lies.
 Any places you've already been?
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship1 03a 1.ogg Chiori: Oh yeah, loads. It was a long journey from Inazuma to Fontaine, after all.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship1 03a 2.ogg Chiori: The wines and ballads of Mondstadt, the prosperous commercial hub that's Liyue Harbor, the bustling Grand Bazaar and the never-ending desert in Sumeru... I've seen it all.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship1 03a 3.ogg Chiori: One thing I liked to do was head to the liveliest spot in town, find a seat, and just sit there people-watching all day. I wanted to get a sense of the local atmosphere, see the clothes people wore, imagine what kind of lives they lived...
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship1 03a 4.ogg Chiori: I sometimes feel like to this day, most of the inspiration for my designs still comes from the things I saw back then on my travels... You of all people probably get what I'm talking about.
 Where would you like to go?
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship1 03b 1.ogg Chiori: Somewhere I've never been before. That's the only way I can find new inspiration.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship1 03b 2.ogg Chiori: You know what, I've never been to Natlan or Snezhnaya... Hmm, maybe it's time to make some travel plans.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship1 03b 3.ogg Chiori: Every nation has a completely different fashion sense rooted in its unique culture. I have to keep incorporating new styles, adapting them, combining them, and innovating... That's the only way Chioriya Boutique can continue to stand at the forefront of fashion.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Chiori: Hah, look at me — chat about anything for long enough, and I'll always find a way to make it about work.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Chiori: Hmm... I guess it's a deeply ingrained habit of mine. I'm always on the lookout for inspiration, and every aspect of daily life is a potential source.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Chiori: Anyway. Basically, I love traveling. Maybe one day, our travel plans will overlap and we'll bump into each other somewhere out there.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Chiori: Huh, this one is for the books. A lot of people avoid chatting with me whenever they can help it, because they don't like what I have to say.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Chiori: The truth is, I just prefer it when people can cut to the chase and be straight with one another. The amount of effort some people put into beating around the bush and being diplomatic... It'd be so much quicker to just hash it out and be done with it.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Chiori: What about you? What's your preferred communication style?
 Direct and to the point, like you.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 04a.ogg Chiori: Excellent. That'll save us a lot of trouble.
 I think sometimes, being tactful is better than being blunt...
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 04b 1.ogg Chiori: You do? Well, I just find it a headache.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 04b 2.ogg Chiori: Maybe it's because I always have a clear and firm opinion on things. My feelings are never ambiguous — either I like something, or I don't.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Chiori: I remember one time when I saw a customer hesitating between two different colored outfits.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Chiori: I told her that she should pick the cream-colored one, since it went well with her hair and also accentuated her figure. She turned her nose up at that, and said that stains would show up more on the cream one than the gray one.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Chiori: So I said sure thing — if you're set on the gray one, I can make some adjustments so it'll look more stylish. But she didn't like that idea either, and she started saying that maybe gray was a bit too dull.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Chiori: We went back and forth like that for a whole afternoon. In the end? She picked a red one...
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Chiori: I mean, I do understand where she was coming from. Her concerns were valid, it's just... People like that... they need to learn to prioritize between criteria when they're making a decision.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Chiori: If you want something that goes with your figure, pick the cream. If you want to get away with a few smudges and stains, pick the gray.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 11.ogg Chiori: But if what you really want is to stand out from the crowd so your crush will spot you as soon as they arrive at the party... then for goodness' sake, just tell me that as soon as you walk through my door!
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 12.ogg Chiori: Phew... I'm getting all worked up just thinking about it. I need a moment to calm down...
 Maybe she was just shy?
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 13.ogg Chiori: You're right. She was hesitant about telling me. But if she'd just been direct with me, we could have saved so much time, and then I would have been able to do a better job of tailoring her outfit to suit her needs.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 14.ogg Chiori: Things like that happen all the time. It makes me all the more determined to never beat around the bush, and always be upfront and direct.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 15.ogg Chiori: Sure, it might not be the smartest approach. But for me at least, it's definitely the most efficient.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 16.ogg Chiori: All this is to say that I will never hide my true thoughts and feelings from you, and I'd like it if you could do the same for me.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 17.ogg Chiori: Of course, if you ever find yourself compelled to say something like "Chioriya Boutique's outfits are hideous"... then I'd hope you at least follow it up with some sort of reasoned argument that I can consider.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship2 18.ogg Chiori: You don't seem like the type of person who'd say something just to be provocative. Unless... I dunno, you secretly enjoy the feeling of being thrown out of my front door, or something.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
 Anything you want to do?
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Chiori: Do you have any hagoita here? I could go for a round or two against you.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Chiori: Hey, what's that look supposed to mean? Don't think I'm good for anything beyond sewing and stitching, huh?
 Nothing, just... Didn't know you were into that game. That's all.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Chiori: I played it all the time when I was growing up in Inazuma. I was actually one of the best players around.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Chiori: But no one knows how to play in Fontaine, and playing with beginners just feels... I don't know... kind of unfair to them?
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Chiori: You must have played it during your travels in Inazuma, right? I bet you're pretty good.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Chiori: Well? You game? Don't tell me you're scared?
 Bring it on!
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 07a 1.ogg Chiori: Yeah, that's more like it! There's the Traveler everyone talks about.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 07a 2.ogg Chiori: And just so we're clear, I will definitely exercise my bragging rights if you lose.
 What's the penalty for the person who loses?
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 07b 1.ogg Chiori: Huh? Ooh, you wanna raise the stakes, do you? Fine by me, that'll make this much more fun.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 07b 2.ogg Chiori: If you lose... you come help out at my store for a few days. You can do some sweeping, organize the outfits, maybe do a little modeling...
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 07b 3.ogg Chiori: And if I lose, I help out at your place instead. It's up to you. I can sweep the place, or maybe do some decorating...
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Chiori: We can start whenever you're ready. I've got my own pair of hagoita that I can use.
 ...You're gonna use both?
 ...Isn't that a bit unfair?
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Chiori: There's nothing in the rules that says you can't use two. I use twin blades in combat, what's so strange about using twin hagoita?
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Chiori: You can go ahead and use four hagoita against me, if you want. I don't mind.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Chiori: Unless... you'd rather forfeit right now?
 ...I just hope you're not a sore loser!
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Chiori: Oh, don't you worry about that. Even though the Chioriya brand is all about never admitting defeat, I have no problem with accepting a loss in a game between friends.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo friendship3 13.ogg Chiori: On one condition, of course... You have to actually beat me first.
(Between 6:00 and 19:00)
 Good morning, Chiori.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo morning 01.ogg Chiori: Morning. I'm still waking up... Need to make myself some coffee.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo morning 02.ogg Chiori: Mind if I borrow your kitchen? I promise I'll clean up afterwards.
(Between 19:00 and 6:00)
 Good night, Chiori.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo night 01.ogg Chiori: Another day, gone... How time flies.
Media:vo chiori mimitomo night 02.ogg Chiori: I'm gonna take another look at my pattern pieces. Go get some rest — no need to wait up for me.

Special Dialogue[]
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.

Wakeful Spring[]

Media:vo mimitomo dq chiori fiesta 01.ogg Chiori: I haven't seen such a fine hot spring since before I left Inazuma... I've missed this.
Media:vo mimitomo dq chiori fiesta 02.ogg Chiori: I got into the habit of taking a dip every day after work back when I still lived there. It's something I still enjoy... although in Fontaine, I'm limited to the humble bathtub in my home.
Media:vo mimitomo dq chiori fiesta 03.ogg Chiori: I'm gonna go ahead and jump in. Is there anywhere to put my clothes? Or shall I just fold them up and leave them on the ground?

Court of Justice's Booming Commerce[]

Media:vo mimitomo fd chiori businessdistrict 01.ogg Chiori: This was my favorite sight when I first moved to Fontaine. And now, it's one I get to see every day as I walk through the streets.
Media:vo mimitomo fd chiori businessdistrict 02.ogg Chiori: Here, on these dazzling streets that seem to go on forever, the first corner of the Chiori fashion kingdom has been established.
Media:vo mimitomo fd chiori businessdistrict 03.ogg Chiori: I will work hard to expand its territory over the coming years. In the meantime, you're always welcome to drop by for a visit.
