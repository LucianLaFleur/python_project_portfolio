Appearance[]
Half of Ningguang's hair is tied up into a wide bun that resembles a fan. The rest falls into two divided parts. Her bun is accessorized with a dark blue hairpin, and she wears a dark blue tassel decoration atop her head which lays between her eyes.
Ningguang wears a gold-patterned dark blue dress one slit at the back and two slits at the front show her legs and her white shorts. Her Vision rests at the top of the slit that shows her left leg. The dress is thigh-length at her sides and knee-length in the front and back. She has a narrow, dark blue fur ring on each of her upper arms, and her dress has multiple thin dark blue and pale blue straps at the top that connect to a dark blue collar with a golden gem in front. She additionally wears a pair of open-toe heels with butterflies pinned to the ankle straps.

Description[]
Ningguang, the great mover and shaker of Liyue's mercantile spheres, always seems to have a confident, steady smile on her face.
But even she cannot escape the vagaries of depression, reluctance, loneliness, and other anxieties that trouble the ordinary people of Liyue.
Once, when Liyue Harbor teetered on the brink of a crisis, Ningguang was forced to sacrifice her Jade Chamber — the sky palace she had built up for many years through much sweat and tears.
All the memories of her past, sweet or bitter, were cast into the ocean with the Jade Chamber, and there they sank. Even one such as Ningguang could nary bear the loss.
Even after the dust had settled and the opportunity to rebuild the Chamber came, she still spent much time in troubled consideration.
Many things happen in this world — who could say when great loss might loom?
Each time she thought on this, she would feel depressed.
As the banquet in the skies began anew, Ningguang stepped forward in her indigo dress to invite the gathered guests to celebrate with her.
Yet amid the revelry, amidst the sea of famous relics, precious trinkets, fine cuisine, and the cries of joy and laughter,
Liyue's Tianquan was once again gripped by melancholy.
Leaving her seat, she stood under the night sky with a clouded heart.
The sounds of cheer within the pavilion could no longer be heard from this far away — it was as if she were alone under the stars.
As she often would in past, she gazed down at Liyue beneath her feet—
The faint moonlight seemed to be cast about Liyue's face like a veil. From Bishui Plain to Lisha, the land was painted a magnificent, gentle white.
This was a sight that Ningguang was most familiar with. Ever since the Jade Chamber was completed, she would gaze upon this majestic view every night.
Time flies, but the mountains and seas remain.
"The mortal world is fleeting, but there are things that will not change so easily."
"A hundred years from now, perhaps, all things might be different. But then, my beauty would have faded, my body reduced to withered bones."
"This garment, too, will by then have grown dull, no matter how opulent it may have been in its prime."
"But so long as I live, riches uncounted shall be at my disposal, as shall the Tianquan's authority, so vested in me."
"I will live this life to the full — lacking not at all for power, wealth, or friends."
"Was this not what I resolved to do from the beginning? If so, then how could I simply allow myself to fall into this pit — to lose my wits because of a moment's emptiness?"
"Life must be treasured precisely because it is fleeting."
"But a thousand, even ten thousand years from now, those who come after will remember this name — Ningguang."
As she returned to the feast, her heart was clear.
And when she emerged before the crowd again, the Tianquan Ningguang wore that calm, self-assured smile once more.

Personality
The Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing. Her wealth is unsurpassed in all of Teyvat.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Ningguang is a professional businesswoman, having accumulated her wealth through hard work and perseverance. As the Tianquan, she is known for being highly meticulous in her work and holds a large amount of influence within Liyue.
She is a calculating and ruthless businesswoman guided by the sole aim of making Mora,"[2] which stems from her impoverished background.[3] She makes use of a large intelligence network and "pawns" to gain the information she needs, and will only make use of people whose weaknesses she knows.[4] As a result, she is disliked by those with significant influence, but nonetheless, many accept it as she adds to the overall prosperity of both the Qixing and Liyue Harbor itself.
Despite her cold, business-driven exterior, she has Liyue's best interests at heart. Under her decree in response to a case of water contamination, those who intentionally endanger public health and safety should be "shown no mercy whatsoever."[5] When Osial was reawakened and threatened Liyue Harbor, she put her conflict with the adepti aside and ultimately sacrificed the Jade Chamber, her life's work, to seal it away. Though per usual, she quickly had it rebuilt for her ambitions to have it spread all across the nations of Teyvat. She is also particularly fond of children, both because they give her vital intelligence and she enjoys seeing them smile.

Appearance

Ningguang uses the tall female model. She has fair skin, red eyes, and straight, knee-length, white-beige hair that fades into an ashy color at the ends.
Ningguang also carries a smoking pipe with her, as seen in one of her idles.

Official Introduction
Jade Star in the Sky
The biggest secret in Liyue, is not a secret in of itself, but Ningguang, who herself knows all the secrets of Liyue.—Kaiyang of the Liyue Qixing's comment regarding Ningguang
Ningguang is one of the "Liyue Qixing," lethally perceptive and a sharp talker to boot. In the grand marketplace that is Liyue, Ningguang is second to none.
Everyone who meets Ningguang becomes awe-inspired by her exemplary insight and remarkable smarts. On top of that, her style is one of a kind.
She invested an astronomical amount into purchasing up huge volumes of Plaustrite, a type of rock with levitation properties. With this, she was able to build a resplendent residence in the sky above Liyue, known as the Jade Chamber.
Her chamber is much like Ningguang herself — beyond measure, above the masses, and draws attention from all.
Despite being a mogul who shakes the very foundations of business circles, she is adored by the children of Liyue like an older sister. A socialite at Yujing Terrace banquets and a connoisseur in the world of desserts, she remains Liyue's most beautiful, unsolvable enigma.

Character Stories
Character Details
The "Liyue Qixing" controls all of the commerce that takes place in Liyue Harbor. Its highly-revered position is also coveted by many. Their primary ruling is to play things safe and keep a low profile.The "Tianquan" of the Qixing, Ningguang, is the only exception. She is seen as an excellent merchant in the eyes of her rivals, a friendly elder sister to kids, a socialite at the banquets of Yujing Terrace, and a connoisseur of desserts... Ningguang is the talk of the town, and everyone seems to know everything about her. However, they all seem to tell a different story of Ningguang, with great discrepancies between the versions.Still, if there's one thing all the rumors about her agree on, it's that Ningguang is someone truly extraordinary.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Up above Liyue Harbor, there is a floating palace held up by plaustrite. It is known as the "Jade Chamber," and it belongs to Ningguang.On a clear day, one can see almost all of Liyue Harbor from the decks outside the palace gates.Whenever Ningguang has important business matters to handle, she invariably comes to this floating palace. She strictly forbids anyone from accessing the premises except for her three trusted confidants. Her confidants sort through the relevant information, summarize it and hang the summaries on the wall, while Ningguang rests against the railings, enjoying the view of Liyue and quietly mulling everything over.She is certain to arrive at the perfect solution before her confidants have finished adding everything to the wall. Once she has made her decision she shreds everything and throws it out of the window, creating something of a snowstorm of paper.The handwriting on the shredded pieces of paper stands out like ink in the snow to all of the merchants in Liyue Harbor.For they know that whenever Ningguang's shredded snow falls, a huge change is about to descend on the business community.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
"Ningguang knows everything," foreigners will often find the Liyue locals warning them.Loophole-hunting guilds, market-manipulating hoarders, smugglers coming ashore with their illicit goods... The Tianquan knows all the details, good, bad and ugly.Once, an alchemist from Sumeru was traveling in Liyue and unwittingly happened across the records of a certain noctilucous jade transaction involving the Blackcliff Forge ten years prior. That night, someone from Ningguang's inner circle knocked on his window and invited him to join Ningguang in the Jade Chamber for a talk.Rumor has it that Ningguang has enchanted the Jade Chamber in such a way that allows her to eavesdrop on everyone in the city's private conversations...The truth is that Ningguang's eyes and ears are in fact the children who play on the streets in Liyue Harbor.Between them, they are aware of every confidential meeting, every private conversation, and every new visitor to the city. When Ningguang gathers them around, her promise of delicious treats proves to be an irresistible incentive, and so they tell her everything they know.Once she has finished carefully cross-referencing everything she has learned from the children against other sources, there is no secret hidden from her in Liyue Harbor.She understands the value of reciprocity more than anyone, which is why she is more than willing to invest time in mingling with the common folk.On top of that, she does actually like seeing the children smile.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Ningguang's attitude to making money is largely the same as anyone else's: you can never have enough.But money to her is more than just a sign of wealth — each Mora is a trophy of a hard-won victory.Ningguang is kind and friendly toward the common folk, but this is a side of her that none of her business associates could ever hope to see.To her, the business world is a playground, and the zero-sum games are the most exciting. Each round she wins against a wealthy merchant brings a gleeful smile to her face as they sigh and reluctantly hand over the Mora, and nothing makes her happier than seeing the guilds bow to her wishes.Every victory in this game adds to the wealth of the Liyue Qixing. Liyue Harbor prospers as a result, and this in turn creates more business opportunities and more profit for Ningguang. Every member of the Liyue Qixing is more than happy with this perfect cycle of interlocking interests.People often ask Ningguang why she is still doing business in Liyue Harbor when she has already acquired such vast wealth."Vast wealth is a wonderful thing."Ningguang patiently replies, never able to understand why people would ask such foolish questions."Adding another Mora to the pot can hardly make it any less wonderful, now, can it?"Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Everyone living in Liyue Harbor has to abide by the rules. Those who do so will see their interests protected, while those who violate the rules will be punished accordingly.The rules are rooted in ancient laws set down by Morax, Liyue Harbor's divine protector, and they are absolute. Over the millennia, each Tianquan has introduced amendments to the rules to ensure they are well aligned with current societal needs.The laws are compiled and published along with a 279-page commentary, and a copy is given to each citizen of Liyue.Ningguang likes it this way: Law and order is good for business, and she understands the intricacies of the laws that forge the order better than anyone else.However, there was a certain ship captain by the name of Beidou who acted with flagrant disregard for the rules, smuggling contraband goods by leveraging her exotic cargo and exclusive business intelligence. To Ningguang, captain Beidou was the black sheep of Liyue Harbor's business community.As Tianquan, it fell to Ningguang to impose heavy fines on Beidou each time she transgressed the rules. But much to her consternation, Beidou seemed to take these fines in her stride, like water off a duck's back.Outside of the official channels, too, Ningguang tried to find ways to implore Beidou to change her ways and stop putting the Qixing in such a difficult position. In response, Beidou simply explained away her actions as "enacting justice," "helping the poor" and "keeping the sailors in their jobs." As a firm believer in the principle of live and let live, Beidou had no time for Ningguang's advice.In the end, Ningguang agreed to disagree and gave up trying to convince the stubborn Beidou to change.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Being the charming and wealthy woman that she is, Ningguang has never had a shortage of suitors.It seems that every eligible bachelor, from the young esquires of Yujing Terrace, to accomplished young businessmen, to renowned sea captains, has at some point invested substantial energy into trying to win Ningguang's affection. One rumor even has it that a wealthy businessman from the Court of Fontaine signed a major trade deal with Liyue Harbor for the sole reason that it would mean he could see Ningguang more often.Ningguang treats all her suitors with an equal measure of kindness and grace, but also keeps them at distance — enough to keep them interested but not push them away. Curiosity got the better of everyone in town, and now everyone wants to know: Who is Ningguang's lover? Little do they know, Ningguang has no love for finite things, and will certainly not be bound by something that is finite.The Jade Chamber, a floating palace above Liyue Harbor, belongs to Ningguang alone. It started out about the size of a room, but has since grown so large that in the moonlight it casts its shadow over the whole of Liyue.A portion of Ningguang's seemingly limitless wealth goes towards hiring skilled craftsmen to continue the expansion and refurbishment of the Jade Chamber, ensuring that it becomes ever more extravagant as time goes by.To Ningguang, the Jade Chamber is a symbol of her wealth and power, and a sign that her business is flourishing.Save for Mora, it is the thing Ningguang loves most in the world — because it is infinite.One day, she insists, it will cast its shadow over all the seven nations of Teyvat.Chess Game: Liyue Millennial Friendship Lv. 4
Ningguang invented a form of chess to pass the time.This chessboard not only contains to-scale reproductions of Liyue Harbor's natural and urban geography, vendors, tea houses, shops, hotels and miscellaneous stores, but it also contains six, ten and twelve-sided dice (among others.) Players use the dice to determine how far their chess pieces move, and landing on various locations will trigger different events. Victory in-game is decided by the number of counters in each player's hands.The rules can change at any time according to Ningguang's fancies, and when playing with others, she will always follow the newest rule set that she has on hand.When she's truly feeling the spirit, she will even design new rules on the spot — no one has yet beaten her at this game, and she has now reached the 32.6th edition of her rulebook.She marketed the 8th edition of the game to the general public, believing it to be the easiest to understand, but it proved to still be far too complicated for ordinary folk.Nonetheless, people flock to purchase sets on account of the beauty and intricacy of the model pieces.In truth, more people buy it for the models than for the game.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
No one knows how Visions are created — they have always seemed to just appear out of thin air, leaving the countless unacknowledged in the lurch without a clue as to how to get one.As for Visions left behind after their users die, they are masterless husks without any elemental power, nor is any method of reawakening them known, save for a tiny chance that it may resonate with another — and only one such "other" at a time...Ningguang's first thought upon seeing such an object a subconscious "oh, look, a new business opportunity."Putting this up for sale would surely have the rich shelling out for it. And if they can't resonate with it, why, they'll just use it to keep up appearances. A sound call either way...And if there should be a way to collect such empty shells, could this not become a long term business?Playing with the jewel in one hand, Ningguang began writing plans for an auction in the other, her smile widening as she thought about the riches to be had — and at that moment, the Vision shone forth its light.Ningguang's smile froze as the Vision activated.Her attendants, coming upon the sight of their mistress, awakened Vision in hand, began to congratulate her on having obtained a priceless treasure.Ningguang, for her part, seemed annoyed instead."What's there to be happy about? Once broken, considered sold!"

Trivia
Ningguang is mentioned in The Steambird - Teyvat Food Notes column (blog post) about Golden Crab — her least favorite dish. The columnist, Long Erjun (an alternate-universe version of the Traveler), prepares Golden Crab for her, only to be rebuffed with the same dialogue she uses in her "Least favorite food..." voice-over line.[6]
Her constellation is an armillary sphere.
Ningguang does not use her catalyst when casting her Normal or Charged Attacks and only uses it when activating her Elemental Skill, Plunging Attack or Elemental Burst; she summons her gems without her catalyst.
Ningguang is modest when it comes to food, preferring simple and basic dishes, showing disdain towards more luxurious food such as Golden Crab.
Ningguang is known by these aliases or titles:
Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing
Tailor of Liyue[7]
Ningguang shares her Korean voice actress, Gwak Gyu-mi, with Xingqiu.
Etymology
Ningguang (凝光) in Chinese means "Frozen Light" or "Condensed Light."
Her name might have been derived from the Chinese Classic 《滕王阁序》 "Téngwánggéxù", "Preface to the Ode of Prince Teng's Pavilion." 潦水尽而寒潭清 烟光凝而暮山紫 "The puddles on the ground have dried up, and the water in the pond is cool and translucent. At dusk the rays of the setting sun, condensed in the evening haze, turn the mountains purple."
Another derivation from her name comes from the Tang Dynasty Poem 《八月十五夜桃源玩月》 "Bāyuèshíwǔyè Táoyuánwányuè", "The Frolic with the Moon in the Peach Forest on Mid-Autumn." 凝光悠悠寒露坠 此时立在最高山 "Concentrated light like slowly descends like frozen dew, I stand upon the peak of the blossoming woods."
Her constellation, Opus Aequilibrium, is roughly Latin for "The Balancing Creation." This likely refers to the diagram of her constellation resembling a gyroscope.
In Chinese, her constellation is instead 玑衡仪座 Jīhéngyí-zuò, "Armillary Sphere Apparatus Constellation."
Notably, the English translation consistently translates 玑衡 Jīhéng as "(a)equilibrium" rather than "armillary sphere" — the Chinese title for Verses of Equilibrium can be more directly translated as "Armillary Sphere Scriptures."
玑衡 Jīhéng can also refer to all the seven stars in the Big Dipper from two of the seven stars Tianji (天玑 Tiānjī) and Yuheng (玉衡 Yùhéng).
Her title, Tianquan (天权/天權 Tiānquán, "Celestial Balance"), is the Chinese name for the star in the Big Dipper named Delta Ursae Majoris (Megrez), consistent with the naming convention for members of the Liyue Qixing.

Dialogue

Media:vo ningguang mimitomo hello 01.ogg Ningguang: Hello, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo hello 02.ogg Ningguang: Is there some matter of importance you wish to discuss with me?
 How do you like it here?
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Ningguang: This is a comfortable environment, a good place to be calm and gather one's thoughts.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Ningguang: Much like the days in the Jade Chamber...
 Surely this place doesn't compare to the Jade Chamber...?
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship1 03a.ogg Ningguang: Oh, you misunderstand.
 You're too kind.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship1 03b.ogg Ningguang: Please. Kindness has nothing to do with it.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Ningguang: An environment can't be judged purely on its size or opulence.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Ningguang: I sense the time and effort that you have put into this place, which reminds me of the time and effort when constructing the Jade Chamber.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Ningguang: Or, to put it another way, I see this as the "Jade Chamber" that belongs to you.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Ningguang: A chat? Is there some commercial matter you wish to inquire about?
 N—No... just a simple chat.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Ningguang: Hmm, interesting... so many merchants and business magnates, vying to invite me to dinner.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Ningguang: And you wish to have a "simple chat"?
 I don't think I can afford the dinners they're buying.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship2 04a.ogg Ningguang: Hahaha... Ahh, you make me laugh.
 We can talk about anything you like.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship2 04b.ogg Ningguang: ... You really are quite different from the rest.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Ningguang: These people... they send me the most extravagant gifts...
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Ningguang: ...But all they're really after are my words... any morsel of information that may hint at Liyue's future commercial trends.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Ningguang: Which makes the prospect of a carefree, honest chat here with you... all the more valuable to me.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Ningguang: For it is something Mora cannot buy.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Ningguang: So, stay with me a while, and let's chat about the simpler things in life. Anything at all.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
 Is there anything you'd like to do?
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Ningguang: As a matter of fact... there is something I've been planning for a while now.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Ningguang: The next time we have an important policy decision on our hands, I'd like you to get involved.
 To help collate paperwork?
 To study the thinking behind policy-making?
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Ningguang: Not exactly... I was thinking that you would be involved in the decision itself.
 Am I up to that...?
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship3 04a 1.ogg Ningguang: Rest assured, I am not prone to misjudgment.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship3 04a 2.ogg Ningguang: The fount of knowledge and boldness of spirit that your travels have bequeathed upon you are sure to imbue your policies with rare and valuable foresight.
 I will give it my all.
 I will rise to the challenge.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship3 04b 1.ogg Ningguang: I like your boldness of spirit.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship3 04b 2.ogg Ningguang: The world of commerce is a battleground, and policy-making requires conviction and decisiveness.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship3 04b 3.ogg Ningguang: All that you have experienced during your travels is sure to imbue your policies with rare and valuable foresight.
 I will give it my all.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Ningguang: I have no doubt.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Ningguang: Oh, that reminds me.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Ningguang: After the decision is made, if you could please shred any documentation that accumulates on the wall during the process.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Ningguang: Liyue is due another paper snowstorm. This time, you will be the one to change the prevailing weather.
(Between 6:00 and 19:00)
 Morning, Ningguang!
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo morning 01.ogg Ningguang: Good morning, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo morning 02.ogg Ningguang: If you encounter any difficulties on your travels, feel free to tell me all about them.
(Between 19:00 and 6:00)
 Good night, Ningguang.
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo night 01.ogg Ningguang: Good night to you too, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo ningguang mimitomo night 02.ogg Ningguang: Try to relax and enjoy yourself while you're here. Get some rest.

Special Dialogue
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.

Feiyun Study Room

Media:vo mimitomo ly ningguang study 01.ogg Ningguang: This is a fine study.
Media:vo mimitomo ly ningguang study 02.ogg Ningguang: The books here are considered quite rare. And those material catalogs from Mondstadt, hmm... perhaps they might provide some competitive market advantage.
Media:vo mimitomo ly ningguang study 03.ogg Ningguang: If I had to say one thing, it would be that the decorations are a little simple. It wouldn't hurt to consider adding more... presentable articles of furniture.

Glittering Street

Media:vo mimitomo ly ningguang store 01.ogg Ningguang: I have observed Liyue from the Jade Chamber for years - every building and every tile is etched into my memory.
Media:vo mimitomo ly ningguang store 02.ogg Ningguang: I cannot sense the slightest feeling of discord from this street... It is quite a rare find indeed.
Media:vo mimitomo ly ningguang store 03.ogg Ningguang: Your ability never ceases to surprise me...
