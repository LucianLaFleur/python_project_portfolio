OverviewLoreVoice-OversOutfitsCompanionGallery
Leader of the Tenryou Commission's forces. A charismatic woman who acts as swiftly as a storm wind and always honors her word.She bears the title of "Devotee of the Divine" and has sworn her allegiance to the Raiden Shogun.The eternity that the Shogun pursues is the cause that she is willing to fight for.—Description from the Official Website[1]
Kujou Sara is a member and adopted daughter of the Kujou Clan, who serves the Raiden Shogun. She supports her Vision Hunt Decree and leads troops to seize Visions. Kujou Sara is also described as a "tengu warrior" with "wings as dark as a raven".[2]
Before the events of the game, Kazuha's friend challenged the Raiden Shogun over her Decree. Kujou Sara accepted the challenge on the Shogun's behalf and prevailed against his friend in the ensuing duel which she came out victorious. Before she could claim his Electro Vision after giving him the Divine Punishment which resulted in the passing of the brave soul, Kazuha, who had just entered to witness his friend's demise, inexplicably snatched it and fled from Inazuma.[3] Sometime later, she defeated Arataki Itto and seized his Vision as part of the decree.

Personality
A general of the Tenryou Commission. Bold, decisive, and skilled in battle.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Despite being an adopted member of the Kujou Clan, she is immensely loyal to the Shogun's rule and tirelessly works to create the eternity that the Shogun desires, even if she does not live to see it herself. Those who speak to her note that she has a ruthless, yet efficient and stern attitude, fitting for her position in the Tenryou Commission. Her devotion to the Shogun's cause and her honorable conduct has gained her the respect of those under her command. She prefers doing everything herself when possible; compared to other Tenryou generals, she participates in battle alongside her men (and head-on attacks as a result) rather than remaining at the back. She despises dishonorable conduct and those who betray the Shogun's will.
Sara's dedication to the Shogun seems to stem from the fact that she believes the Shogun saved her from death when she was bestowed an Electro Vision as she was falling a great height during a battle. This action not only led to her life being spared but to the young tengu being adopted into the Kujou Clan and an unbreakable devotion to the Electro Archon. Although Sara appreciates Takayuki adopting her, she expresses a sense of loneliness in that she can tell he doesn't truly regard her as family and doesn't treat her the same way he treats his biological children. Kamaji is the only one who treated her as his real sister.
She enjoys quick and easy-filling foods, but dislikes sweets because they put her at ease, something which she finds unfitting for her duties.

Appearance

Kujou Sara uses the tall female model. She has indigo hair cut into an uneven bob, pale skin, and golden eyes. As a tengu, she has two pairs of black raven-like wings that can unfurl from her back; these are seen in one of her idle animations and when she unleashes Subjugation: Koukou Sendou, her Elemental Burst. Additionally, on the side of her head lies a red tengu mask that resembles a crow's face with white accents, a black crest, and a hexagonal piece resembling a tokin.

Official Introduction
Fly Like the Wind, Strike Like Lightning
I must admit, Kujou Sara is an opponent that cannot be taken lightly. Although we have opposing views, her loyalty and sincerity is truly admirable... I believe that in the entire city of Inazuma, she is the one with the most adoration for the Shogun.—Sangonomiya Kokomi
Leader of the Tenryou Commission's forces. Bold, decisive, and skilled in battle.
If the Almighty Shogun is the sound of thunder that fills the heavens, Kujou Sara is the lightning strike against which her enemies are powerless to defend themselves — and wherever lightning first strikes, terrifying thunder is sure to follow.
As the adopted daughter of the Kujou Clan, she conducts herself with an official demeanor at all times. Ask anyone about their impression of Kujou Sara, and they will likely talk of her ruthless efficiency and stern attitude.
Yet this loyal subject of the Shogun is not as cold and indifferent as she seems on the surface. Rather, she has surrendered herself to the demands of her role, her strong sense of duty causing her to put aside her own desires in service of a greater cause.
For Kujou Sara, helping the Almighty Shogun to achieve eternity is a paramount goal. She knows that she herself may not be there in the end, but she devotes herself to this mission all the same.
"Victory will belong to all of us, even if I am not the last person remaining on the battlefield."
If people could have only one wish, this would be Kujou Sara's.
Concealed beneath her icy exterior is a heart that pounds like thunder, where passionate flames burn in secret.

Character Stories
Character Details
The blood of the tengu runs through Kujou Sara's veins, but she does not dwell in the forests and mountains as they do. She was fostered from a young age by the Kujou Clan and has served since then as part of the Tenryou Commission.The Tenryou Commission is one arm of the Tri-Commission, and is in charge of the security of Inazuma. Today, Sara is a general of the Tenryou Commission, and hers is the vital task of maintaining order within Inazuma City itself.She governs well and is ever determined to set a good example for her subordinates. No matter how tough the issue, if it falls under the Tenryou Commission's jurisdiction, Sara can solve it in good time.Sara smiles little and is swift and resolute in the pursuit of her missions, and so many Inazumans consider her an inaccessible, stone-cold military person.However, such an assessment might be too surface-level for someone like Sara, who seems cool on the outside but burns within.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
In Inazuma, the Vision Hunt Decree is the manifestation of the Raiden Shogun's will to pursue Eternity, and Sara is the main enforcer of that decree.Sara believes that Visions, in the hands of those with incorrectly-aligned minds, will destabilize the foundations of Inazuma, thus necessitating the Vision Hunt Decree.However, this does not mean that Sara will stoop to any means necessary to enforce it.When citizens are inevitably affected as the decree is carried out, she will expend the utmost patience and sincerity to attempt to explain the Almighty Shogun's long-term goals.She has also given clear orders forbidding the harming or exploiting of civilians during the pursuit of the decree, as such evil deeds will only drag the great name of the Archon through the mud.Unfortunately, the vast ideals of the Archon are too great for mortals to perceive, and resentment arises nonetheless, with some even uniting to resist those who enforce the decree.In such circumstances, where she has no choice but to take action, Sara often sighs helplessly before facing the enemy.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
The Shogun's Army has Kujou Sara's leadership to thank in large part for the fearlessness and unity of its soldiery.Surveying battle lines, setting up training plans, selecting weapons and armor... Unlike many generals who prefer to strategize and plan from the rear, Sara prefers to do such things herself.Sara is very harsh on herself during training, with her personal regimen being over ten times tougher than that which the ordinary troops go through. Even when night has fallen and the world has gone to sleep, one can still hear the sounds of her bow being drawn echoing through the dojo.On the battlefield, she has always been at the tip of the spear, leading the troops with absolute heroism and awe-inspiring fighting spirit.When the dust has settled, she will also personally see to the wounded, and give reward and mete out punishment based on merit. Every step of the battle that passes through her hands is managed well, with missteps being very few and far between.Sara's troops are all witnesses to her words and deeds. No one who has fought alongside her does not hold her in the highest regard.The general is the soul of the army, and fine generals are hard to find. Small wonder, then, that Sara has always been the pride of the Shogun's Army.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Even when she is not training, Sara brings her austere, strict nature into her daily life.Her life seems to follow some sort of eternal, unchanging rule. She wakes up on the dot, trains on the dot, eats a fixed amount...From things as large as training regimens to things as small as food consumption, Sara has her own perspective and pursues her self-created standards to the last letter."Miscellaneous objects are to be sorted by category, and furnishings are to be arrayed in straight lines. There is to neither be dirt in any corner, nor on the ground."These are the standards Sara holds her dwelling up to.She views excellence in such matters to also be a part of her training, and handles them herself, not requiring the aid of any servants.That said, how could her servants ever just stand idly by? Every time they meet Sara, they will implore her to put the cleaning cloth down and leave the matter to them.Having repeatedly declined their offers to no avail, Sara eventually took to cleaning up behind closed doors, posting up this sign outside her room—"Training in Progress, Do Not Disturb."Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Although she has grown up amongst humans, Sara still maintains the various habits of the tengu. When she leaves the Tenryou Commission Headquarters on occasion, it is mostly to go to the mountains.She knows them like the back of her hand, and has witnessed many strange creatures not often told of in human tales.Among them are many fierce and evil things, but there are also little creatures that mean no harm. To Sara, however, these are just differences in form.There was a time when a sizable spate of thefts was reported to the police station in quick succession, and they could not find the culprit. Walking through the woods on higher alert than usual, Sara quickly espied the bake-danuki running along hurriedly while carrying their plunder.Of course, bake-danuki are not evil by nature, but only steal food out of gluttony.Capturing the creatures, Sara had only this to say as she reclaimed their ill-gotten gains:"Hiding in the mountains will not let you escape judgment. Listen closely, for this is your final warning. Do not make yourself a nuisance to civilians again, or else..."The bake-danuki were chilled to the bone, nodding as they balled up in a corner. After this, they would keep to that agreement and did not again do such ill.As for the sharp-tongued Sara, she would bring various melons and fruits that could keep for a longer period up to the mountains while training there, making sure to deposit them in the bake-danuki's dwelling whenever she passed through.She did not explain herself, and in any case, did not consider this any sort of gift. If she had to describe it... then perhaps a sort of consolation to those who had turned from an unrighteous path might be the best description for such things.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Sara has been training with the Shogun's Army ever since she was taken in by the Tenryou Commission. The soldiers actually thought that she was a boy at first due to her coming to train at an early age, and they took care of her very well.Having been a little frightened of crowds at first, Sara became much more outgoing due to this warm reception, and would even play games with the other troops.However, the soldiers she played alongside were severely punished by the Clan Head, while she was merely given a cold chastening."Not following military law and neglecting your training... I did not take you in just to have you do such pointless things."Since then, Sara would be conscientious in maintaining a certain distance from others. Rather than blending in with the crowd, she sought first to attain surpassing martial prowess, bearing in mind at all times that she would someday take command."The Raiden Shogun's helper. An example to the Tenryou Commission. The pride of the Clan Head."None of these three identities put her first in any way. But to Sara, this was her. She was a warrior whose being was calm and austerity.No one ever told her that she should give herself more consideration, and Sara did not necessarily lack such concerns either.Her chains as an adopted child and the solitude of a non-human had always accompanied her mission and status.But to stop due to such obstacles is the dilemma of the weak, and being Kujou Sara, her path would not end here. She would be the Electro Archon's staunchest adherent and the most clear-headed of her generals.Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder Friendship Lv. 4
Out of their worship and love for the Raiden Shogun, many merchants have created and sold artwork related to her.The most popular product among them is the "Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder," a lacquerware doll made using the deity's image as its template.Sara rose early the day it went on the market, easily becoming first in the queue to purchase the statue. This became something of a hot topic for a while.Sara would make no retort concerning any such stories. From her perspective, she bought that item with pious respect in her heart.In all matters related to the Shogun, she had never once committed a perfunctory or negligent act. Indeed, she went forth personally to select and purchase a statue and even personally prepared a shrine within which it might be kept upon her return.She placed five such statues in specially-placed display cases, and would clean them whenever she returned home. If she could not be there, she would arrange for artisans to perform that maintenance instead...To someone like Sara who lacks friends and who is too busy to have much of a private life, the Raiden Shogun is not merely a deity, but also a form of repose.The Shogun is her will, her future, her strength... even the harbinger of her fate — the confluence of all that is noble. Sara's adherence is one born out of recognition and trust.The intricately-made Archon statue makes Sara feel like the Almighty Shogun is not far off in her Tenshukaku, but is a wisdom, an ideal, a strength of heart that supports her every step of the way.These moments of tranquility bring her indescribable enjoyment.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
When she obtained her Vision, she had not yet been given a name or surname.She originally lived in a quiet mountain forest that had, from a time unknown, become plagued by great evils that robbed it of its former peace.Though she had the strength of the tengu, she was still young and could not stand against the monsters alone, and was hurled from a cliff during the battle, her wings having been damaged prior.Plummeting from the heights, and unable to unfurl her injured wings, she seemed fated to fall to her death."No! It can't end like this! I... I always believed that I could protect this place forever with my strength..."When day dawned the next day, some passers-by discovered an unconscious girl by the roadside. She looked a little worse for the wear but seemed otherwise unharmed, adding to the mystery of how she had ended up here.Astonished, the people brought her back to the city and reported the matter to the Tenryou Commission immediately.That was when the Kujou Clan Head, Kujou Takayuki, noticed that the glowing item in her hand was a Vision — a thing that many desired but few ever gained.Realizing that she had gained the attention of an Archon even at her young age, Takayuki believed that she was a destined child, sent to the Tenryou Commission by the heavens.Taking her in, he named her "Sara," and would train her to become an all-around warrior, asking that she serve the Shogun and fight for Inazuma.Kujou Takayuki believed that in raising such an excellent general, the status and future of the Kujou Clan would become more secure. And indeed, all that he had hoped would steadily come to pass.Sara, armed with her Vision, would swiftly distinguish herself, rising through the ranks to become a general of the Tenryou Commission at a young age, just as many had hoped.Yet it was precisely because she possessed a Vision that Sara knew this better than anyone: her surviving that fall unscathed was due to the Archon looking upon her with favor in that instant.In but a single glance, she had been given the power that sustained her life. Everything she had, therefore, could be described as existing by the Almighty Shogun's grace.Fighting for the Shogun...Sara believed that this was neither her duty nor a result of her foster father's schemes, but was instead her truest calling.

Kujou Sara is known by these aliases or titles:
Devotee of the Divine
Kujou Tengu (by Arataki Itto)
Kujou Chicken (by Arataki Itto)
Kujou Sara is mentioned in the descriptions of the following 4 Furnishings: Camp Bow-Rack: Fletching Encampment Fence: Decisive Judgment Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder Court of the Upright
Etymology
Her given name Sara is a common female name in modern Japan. This usage (Sara as a female name) in modern days is probably influenced by the biblical female name Sarah (meaning "noble lady" or "princess" in classical Hebrew). It is, however, often written with kanji characters 沙羅 (裟羅 in Genshin Impact), which is a short for the classical Japanese word sara-souju (Japanese: 沙羅双樹 "Shorea robusta"), a species of tree in India and a Buddhist symbol of transience and impermanence. This traditional usage (sara as a tree name) originates from the Sanskrit word śāla (Sanskrit: शाल "Shorea robusta"), lit. "house."
"The color of sara flowers reveals the principle that the prosperous must decline" is a classical saying in Japan to state that nothing is eternal, which may be related to the theme of Inazuma "Eternity."
Her clan name Kujou is most likely inspired by the Kujou Family, one of the five noblest aristocratic families in Japan. From the 9th to the 19th centuries, except a few rare cases, only the heads of these five families were conventionally entitled to be the regent and chief advisor of an emperor.
Her constellation Flabellum is named after a ceremonial fan typically used by Christian priests, and made from various materials such as feathers. The Japanese name of her constellation  (Japanese: 羽団扇座 hauchiwa-za, "Feather Fan Constellation") refers to hauchiwa (羽団扇), the magical feather fan wielded by tengu.

HelloHelloMedia:VO_Kujou Sara Hello.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_Hello.ogg I am Kujou Sara. You may forget my name, but this you must know: On my watch, Inazuma will always be defended, and the will of the Shogun will always be done. Deity or demon, if you make an enemy of me you will be struck down! Oh, ahem... Don't be so nervous. I have agreed to fight by your side, and I will honor that commitment. I may be uncompromising on matters of great importance, but on most other things, you will find me quite easygoing.

Chat: DutyChat: DutyMedia:VO_Kujou Sara Chat - Duty.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_Chat_-_Duty.ogg The duty of a tengu warrior is to watch over the mountains and forests, while that of the Kujou Clan is to guard Inazuma. These two are of the same ilk.
When It RainsWhen It RainsMedia:VO_Kujou Sara When It Rains.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_When_It_Rains.ogg The sound of rain masks the enemy's footsteps. Stay alert.
When Thunder StrikesWhen Thunder StrikesMedia:VO_Kujou Sara When Thunder Strikes.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_When_Thunder_Strikes.ogg Listen. Thunder speaks the will of the Almighty Shogun.
When It SnowsWhen It SnowsMedia:VO_Kujou Sara When It Snows.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_When_It_Snows.ogg I would like to catch a snowflake, but once you have them in the palm of your hand, they melt away all the more quickly.
When the Sun Is OutWhen the Sun Is OutMedia:VO_Kujou Sara When The Sun Is Out.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_When_The_Sun_Is_Out.ogg The skies are clear and the sun is bright. Fine weather for a showdown.
Good MorningGood MorningMedia:VO_Kujou Sara Good Morning.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_Good_Morning.ogg Good morning...? You mean you only just got out of bed? This is already quite late by my standards. I typically rise well before daybreak.
Good AfternoonGood AfternoonMedia:VO_Kujou Sara Good Afternoon.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_Good_Afternoon.ogg I am not in the habit of resting at noon. But if you wish to do so, I will wait for you.
Good EveningGood EveningMedia:VO_Kujou Sara Good Evening.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_Good_Evening.ogg Good evening. You know, in Hanamizaka, the sight of the Sakura by night is quite splendid. I never tire of it.
Good NightGood NightMedia:VO_Kujou Sara Good Night.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_Good_Night.ogg Go and rest. I will stay here and keep watch.
About Kujou Sara: Tenryou CommissionAbout Kujou Sara: Tenryou CommissionMedia:VO_Kujou Sara About Kujou Sara - Tenryou Commission.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Kujou_Sara_-_Tenryou_Commission.ogg I am grateful to Takayuki. The Tenryou Commission is all I've ever had to rely on, and I will do everything within my power to defend my family's honor. Hmm? You want to know about the Tenryou Commission's code of conduct? Loyalty to the Raiden Shogun, of course! That is also my life's creed.
About Kujou Sara: Preparing for War Friendship Lv. 4About Kujou Sara: Preparing for War Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Kujou Sara About Kujou Sara - Preparing for War.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Kujou_Sara_-_Preparing_for_War.ogg Am I ready to depart? Let me put it to you like this. If you were to make a habit of asking me this question every time before you move out, you would find that you only receive an answer from me one time out of 10. The other nine times, I would already be fighting fiercely on the front line. Not because I am foolhardy, nor because I lack courtesy, but because the battle never waits till you are ready.
About Kujou Sara: Aspiration Friendship Lv. 6About Kujou Sara: Aspiration Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Kujou Sara About Kujou Sara - Aspiration.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Kujou_Sara_-_Aspiration.ogg My aspirations? I thought you already knew: To assist the Almighty Shogun in manifesting Eternity. That is what I aspire to. Hmm? Personal aspirations? It's not something I have ever thought about before...
About Us: ObservationAbout Us: ObservationMedia:VO_Kujou Sara About Us - Observation.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Us_-_Observation.ogg Though you present an unstable factor in the Almighty Shogun's Eternity, unstable does not have to mean a threat. So I am not your enemy — but I will be watching you at all times.
About Us: Experiences Friendship Lv. 6 Omnipresence Over MortalsAbout Us: Experiences Friendship Lv. 6 Omnipresence Over MortalsMedia:VO_Kujou Sara About Us - Experiences.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Us_-_Experiences.ogg When I confiscated people's Visions, I trampled on their ambitions. Now that the Vision Hunt Decree has been repealed, I must atone for my actions. I am led to believe that you can hear those ambitions...The ones echoing within the Visions embedded on the Statue of the Omnipresent God? I'd like you to tell me more about them. Also... your own ambitions, I would like to hear about those as well.
About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Kujou Sara About the Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_the_Vision.ogg Only if the gods cast their gaze upon you will you receive a Vision. Since my own Vision was granted by the Almighty Shogun, I shall return it to her in the end, without hesitation and with no regrets.
Something to Share: Spinning TopSomething to Share: Spinning TopMedia:VO_Kujou Sara Something to Share - Spinning Top.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_Something_to_Share_-_Spinning_Top.ogg During a previous assignment, a vendor in Hanamizaka gifted me a kind of spinning top called the "Solo." It's a toy that you can play with when you're by yourself. I was quite taken with it, so I kept it. ...You want to play with it together? But that would defy the principle on which the Solo is based... Respectfully, I must decline.
Something to Share: Local SpecialtySomething to Share: Local SpecialtyMedia:VO_Kujou Sara Something to Share - Local Specialty.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_Something_to_Share_-_Local_Specialty.ogg Do you know what the most distinctively Inazuman item of all is? No, it is not a blade of any sort. It is a lacquerware carving of the Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder. They are hand-made by old and skilled lacquerware craftspeople, and nearly every single home in the city has one. My house, you ask? I have five.
Interesting ThingsInteresting ThingsMedia:VO_Kujou Sara Interesting Things.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_Interesting_Things.ogg Whenever something is bothering me inside, I stand beneath the Sacred Sakura, close my eyes, and try to calm my mind. When I open my eyes again, the falling blossoms will guide my path.
About Thoma Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over MortalsAbout Thoma Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over MortalsMedia:VO_Kujou Sara About Thoma.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Thoma.ogg The Tenryou Commission's estate is very large. It would serve us well to have a fine housekeeper like Thoma who could keep all the numerous and disparate household affairs in order. If he ever tires of working for the Kamisato Clan, I would very much like for him to come to us... though I doubt that day will ever come.
About Kamisato Ayaka Friendship Lv. 4About Kamisato Ayaka Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Kujou Sara About Kamisato Ayaka.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Kamisato_Ayaka.ogg In the Kujou household, normally the only sound to be heard is that of soldiers training in the dojo. But in the Kamisato household, there is the sound of music, dance, bickering, and laughter... I have heard that Miss Kamisato is skilled in the game of Go, and have always hoped for an occasion to pay her a visit, but... I also worry that someone of a serious demeanor like myself may not quite fit in there.
About Yoimiya Friendship Lv. 4About Yoimiya Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Kujou Sara About Yoimiya.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Yoimiya.ogg As long as she is not setting off fireworks in my camp, I will cause her no trouble. Heh, yes, I know — all else aside, her fireworks are spectacular and brilliant, and she deserves all the praise she gets. The issue for me is that fireworks are fleeting in nature. After one brief moment of dazzling light, all that remains is the pitch-black night sky, the same as before. So I often have to caution myself not to become too captivated by this illusory spectacle. It is transient, but Inazuma is eternal, and my mission is to protect Inazuma.
About Shikanoin Heizou Friendship Lv. 4About Shikanoin Heizou Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Kujou Sara About Shikanoin Heizou.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Shikanoin_Heizou.ogg Shikanoin and I may be colleagues, but I have few positive words to say about him. He seems preoccupied with his personal schemes while official duties take second place. The only reason I have not sought to bring him into line so far is that his investigations deliver results...*sigh* He is such a headache.
About the Raiden Shogun: Trust Friendship Lv. 4About the Raiden Shogun: Trust Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Kujou Sara About Raiden Shogun - Trust.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Raiden_Shogun_-_Trust.ogg As I'm sure you've heard many times before, the Almighty Shogun seeks Eternity — an existence beyond the dominion of thought and longing. "Abandon mortal ties, strive for an unchanging Eternity"... The Almighty Shogun's manner is always resolute, and I do not always fully grasp the meaning of her words. But this is her decision, and I trust her.
About the Raiden Shogun: Service Friendship Lv. 6About the Raiden Shogun: Service Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Kujou Sara About Raiden Shogun - Service.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Raiden_Shogun_-_Service.ogg So, the Vision Hunt Decree was repealed... Yes, it seems that you were right. ...Ahem, but this is not to say that the Almighty Shogun made a mistake. She has simply chosen to pursue eternity by a different route. I do not know whether the Shogun has finally found inner peace after protecting Inazuma over all these millennia. All I know is that however perilous the road ahead may become, I will follow her as I have always done.
About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Kujou Sara About Yae Miko.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Yae_Miko.ogg Guuji Yae's actions often leave me with many questions... Nevertheless, the fact that she is the head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine clearly shows the level of trust and approval that the Shogun places in her, and for this reason I also greatly respect her. But... if there ever comes a day when she disobeys the Shogun's will, then please accept my apologies in advance.
About Sangonomiya Kokomi Friendship Lv. 4About Sangonomiya Kokomi Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Kujou Sara About Sangonomiya Kokomi.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Sangonomiya_Kokomi.ogg She is more proficient as a military strategist than a priestess. The way she uses directives to wage war is almost unheard of. I wonder if I should adopt this technique for commanding the Shogun's Army? Hmm... but this could lead us to a situation whereby war is waged at the negotiation table, each side with their pack of strategy cards, playing them one by one until a victor emerges... Then again, perhaps not.
About Gorou Friendship Lv. 4About Gorou Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Kujou Sara About Gorou.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Gorou.ogg Gorou is to Sangonomiya Kokomi as I am to the Raiden Shogun. He is fiercely loyal, and I have great respect for this. It's a shame we're on opposing sides, so we'll never get to work together... Still, I am glad to have an admirable foe. Also... I hear he's a fifth-born son. That just makes it even better.
About Arataki Itto Friendship Lv. 4About Arataki Itto Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Kujou Sara About Arataki Itto.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Arataki_Itto.ogg Tsk... I can't help but get a little irate when his name comes up. He kicked up a big fuss when I confiscated his Vision, by far the noisiest person... no, the noisiest oni I've ever encountered. He showed he was enough of a man to admit defeat, but the rematch he insisted upon... Tsk... To this day, I still don't want to talk about it. If you really must know, you can go and ask him yourself.
About Kuki Shinobu Friendship Lv. 4About Kuki Shinobu Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Kujou Sara About Kuki Shinobu.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Kuki_Shinobu.ogg With her talent and qualifications, it's a shame she decided to join the Arataki gang. I must concede, however, that at the very least, her presence has effectively prevented idlers from stirring up trouble and disturbing the public, reducing the burden on the Tenryou Commission.
About Kirara Friendship Lv. 4About Kirara Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Kujou Sara About Kirara.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_About_Kirara.ogg Recently, I often feel a mysterious gaze from the shadows that disappears as soon as I turn to look. What an absurd prank... Huh? A nekomata, you say? Huh... She should've just come right up to me if she needed something.

I can't discuss Tenryou Commission business with you, that's strictly confidential, and I certainly can't divulge anything relating to the Almighty Shogun. What exactly are you trying to achieve? Hmm? Me on a personal level...? I suppose that's not out of the question, just... unprecedented.
More About Kujou Sara: II Friendship Lv. 3 Stillness, the Sublimation of ShadowMore About Kujou Sara: II Friendship Lv. 3 Stillness, the Sublimation of ShadowMedia:VO_Kujou Sara More About Kujou Sara - 02.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_More_About_Kujou_Sara_-_02.ogg I lead a relatively simple life when I'm not leading an army into battle. I always get out of bed at 5:05 on the dot. Then I go to the courtyard where I take five deep breaths before walking five laps around it. For breakfast, I typically eat five mouthfuls... Five is my lucky number, so I do things in fives. Do you have some objection to that?
More About Kujou Sara: III Friendship Lv. 4 Stillness, the Sublimation of ShadowMore About Kujou Sara: III Friendship Lv. 4 Stillness, the Sublimation of ShadowMedia:VO_Kujou Sara More About Kujou Sara - 03.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_More_About_Kujou_Sara_-_03.ogg The thing that gave me the most trouble when enforcing the Vision Hunt Decree was those officers of the Shogun's Army who would abuse their authority to be heavy-handed with those we detained. The will of the Almighty Shogun must be executed, but I do not condone violence against innocent people! I have expressly forbidden such behavior on countless occasions but judging by the outcome, it seems difficult to root out. If you have any ideas on how to tackle it, please share them with me.
More About Kujou Sara: IV Friendship Lv. 5 Stillness, the Sublimation of ShadowMore About Kujou Sara: IV Friendship Lv. 5 Stillness, the Sublimation of ShadowMedia:VO_Kujou Sara More About Kujou Sara - 04.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_More_About_Kujou_Sara_-_04.ogg Although I was fully adopted by the Kujou Clan, I know that Takayuki does not look at me the same way he looks at Kamaji. I might be a little stone-faced sometimes, but even I get lonely... especially when I catch sight of one of my subordinates sharing an intimate moment with their family. ...I'm sorry, I have nothing but gratitude for Takayuki. How could I be so disrespectful...
More About Kujou Sara: V Friendship Lv. 6 Stillness, the Sublimation of ShadowMore About Kujou Sara: V Friendship Lv. 6 Stillness, the Sublimation of ShadowMedia:VO_Kujou Sara More About Kujou Sara - 05.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_More_About_Kujou_Sara_-_05.ogg Now that I think about it, you and I are a good example of achieving concord through conflict. We were on opposite sides — diametrically opposed, you could say. I never imagined I would end up alongside you, either in battle or in long conversation... Fate has been kind to me, no, sorry, ignore that.
Kujou Sara's HobbiesKujou Sara's HobbiesMedia:VO_Kujou Sara Hobbies.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_Hobbies.ogg To this day, not a day goes by without bow exercises and target practice. From adopting the stance, to aiming, to hearing the twang of the bowstring, none of this is dry and repetitive for me — it is about transcending the me of yesterday! I wouldn't call it a hobby so much as a lifelong discipline.
Kujou Sara's TroublesKujou Sara's TroublesMedia:VO_Kujou Sara Troubles.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_Troubles.ogg The existence of a tengu warrior's wings is an objective fact, as is the reality that they will take up a certain amount of space when standing side-by-side. So when you say "come closer," I fail to see how exactly I am supposed to achieve that.
Favorite FoodFavorite FoodMedia:VO_Kujou Sara Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_Favorite_Food.ogg I have always had a preference for easy-to-carry foods that provide quick and ample sustenance, such as Onigiri. The top choice for replenishing your stamina in the middle of a battle! But that's just a personal preference. I don't dictate what my subordinates have to eat.
Least Favorite FoodLeast Favorite FoodMedia:VO_Kujou Sara Least Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kujou_Sara_Least_Favorite_Food.ogg I generally avoid sweet foods, not that I have a strong aversion to them. Why? Well, sweet things put your mind and body at rest, so if I ever eat sweet things it's easy to... Ahem, essentially, I mustn't slack off and that's the end of it. No further questions on this topic!

I will dispense with the formalities and get straight to the point — do you have a birthday wish? Providing that it does not conflict with the Almighty Shogun's grand cause, I will make every effort to see it come to fruition. To show that I am being completely serious, I will allow you to make not one, but five birthday wishes.

Dialogue

Media:vo kujousara mimitomo hello 01.ogg Kujou Sara: We meet again, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo hello 02.ogg Kujou Sara: Huh. This place seems in good order.
 How do you like it here?
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Kujou Sara: Though it is not as extensive as the Kujou Clan's estate, I find it comfortable enough.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Kujou Sara: So everything here was built according to your designs? I did not know you possessed such abilities.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Kujou Sara: If we ever need to expand the Kujou Clan residence, I'll be sure to find you.
 Uh, no need...
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship1 04a.ogg Kujou Sara: What's the matter? Are you unwilling to assist?
 I'm up to the challenge!
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship1 04b.ogg Kujou Sara: I have not yet mentioned any specifics and you already agree so readily?
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Kujou Sara: Heh, either way, I'm not here to twist your arm. You needn't worry.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Kujou Sara: In fact, there is little that can be changed about the Kujou Clan residence. I mean, it would never become a place like this, at least.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship1 07.ogg Kujou Sara: I've never visited a place filled with such vitality and happiness...
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Kujou Sara: Seeing as I have nothing better to do, I'll comply.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Kujou Sara: I suppose I have grown accustomed to spending most of my time in solitude. I seldom have the opportunity to speak with others, so perhaps it'd be better for you to start and I answer.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Kujou Sara: Alright, ask away.
 This kinda feels like taking an exam, it's making me nervous.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship2 04a 1.ogg Kujou Sara: Hmm?
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship2 04a 2.ogg Kujou Sara: Interesting. Your expression reminds me of my subordinates when they are giving a report.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship2 04a 3.ogg Kujou Sara: But I should remind you that I've never viewed you as a subordinate.
 Don't you have anything you'd like to ask me?
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship2 04b 1.ogg Kujou Sara: I do, but if I ask, then you must reply.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship2 04b 2.ogg Kujou Sara: If you fail to do so, then you will receive the due punishment. Have you made up your mind?
 Uh...
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Kujou Sara: *sigh* It's difficult to converse with me, isn't it?
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Kujou Sara: To be honest, I've been studying methods of discourse lately in hopes of altering my stern appearance.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Kujou Sara: However, there are many subtleties in communication, it is difficult to grasp in such a short time.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Kujou Sara: If mastering conversation is akin to the skill of archery, then I am confident I can improve with more practice.
 Yes, you will certainly get better with practice.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Kujou Sara: Hm. Good.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Kujou Sara: In that case, I select you as my training partner! You can come talk to me as often as you like. Is that alright?
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
 Anything you'd like to do?
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Kujou Sara: For as long as I can remember, I've been accustomed to handling various matters myself...
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Kujou Sara: Though I once did have the thought of raising pets, due to various circumstances, I was never able to...
 What kind of pet are we talking about here?
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Kujou Sara: Nothing in particular. I just thought it would be nice to have a companion.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Kujou Sara: The commission is a whirlwind of people and unexpected complications, so I often relish opportunities to get away for assignments in the field.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Kujou Sara: Whenever I think about it, I can only conclude that I have no time to care for a pet. Please, forget that I ever mentioned it.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Kujou Sara: But growing up without a companion is not a pleasant experience... Everyone is the same in this regard — pets, people, even tengu.
 You could have a pet. Why not just keep it here?
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Kujou Sara: Hah, I suppose you are right.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Kujou Sara: If I were to keep a pet here, I would certainly need to consult you first. What kind of pet do you think would be best?
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Kujou Sara: I know! How about a Red Horned Lizard? It's a solitary creature and doesn't require much interaction.
 Perhaps a cat would be better...
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 10a.ogg Kujou Sara: A cat? How could I tell whether it's in a good or bad mood?
 Perhaps a dog would be better...
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 10b.ogg Kujou Sara: A dog? You can determine their mood just by looking at their wagging tail, right?
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Kujou Sara: I have no experience in this matter. I'm not entirely sure if I'm qualified to be a pet's "master."
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Kujou Sara: However, because this is a matter between the two of us, you must also hold up your end of the bargain.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 13.ogg Kujou Sara: Hm, to make things easier for you, I will take responsibility for the most difficult part... playing and interacting with it.
 So you mean that I'll have to take care of its...
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 14.ogg Kujou Sara: Exactly. You will be responsible for feeding and cleaning up after it. That's all.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 15.ogg Kujou Sara: Oh, but first and foremost, we must come up with a memorable name for our pet.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo friendship3 16.ogg Kujou Sara: There is no rush, we can discuss it further when we have some ideas to share.
(Between 6:00 and 19:00)
 Morning, Sara!
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo morning 01.ogg Kujou Sara: Morning, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo morning 02.ogg Kujou Sara: I have already completed five sets of bow exercises. If you are up to it, I would not mind accompanying you for another five.
(Between 19:00 and 6:00)
 Good night, Sara.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo night 01.ogg Kujou Sara: Going to bed at this hour? Perhaps there is something on your mind?
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo night 02.ogg Kujou Sara: If so, there is no harm in telling me. If not, then all the better. There's no reason for you to worry needlessly.
Media:vo kujousara mimitomo night 03.ogg Kujou Sara: If there's nothing else, then... good night, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).

Special Dialogue
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.

Court of the Upright

Media:vo mimitomo dq kujousara courtyard 01.ogg Kujou Sara: Impressive. This courtyard is every bit as striking as the headquarters of the Tenryou Commission.
Media:vo mimitomo dq kujousara courtyard 02.ogg Kujou Sara: Maintaining an orderly residence incentivizes us to adhere also to the rules that give order to our lives.
Media:vo mimitomo dq kujousara courtyard 03.ogg Kujou Sara: I must commend you for your insight in having discerned this principle.

Military Exercise Grounds

Media:vo mimitomo dq kujousara trainingground 01.ogg Kujou Sara: At first glance, this camp seems organized along arbitrary lines. But on closer inspection, the underlying principles become clear. I would even say they are rather inspiring.
Media:vo mimitomo dq kujousara trainingground 02.ogg Kujou Sara: Was this an accidental achievement on your part? Or have you studied the art of war in great depth?
Media:vo mimitomo dq kujousara trainingground 03.ogg Kujou Sara: Either way, in accordance with established military convention, those who demonstrate outstanding capabilities ought to be rewarded.
