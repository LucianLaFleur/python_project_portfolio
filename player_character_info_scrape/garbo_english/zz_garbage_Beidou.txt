She is the captain of The Crux, a renowned crew in Liyue. Besides her capabilities as a fleet captain and her immense strength, many in Liyue know her for her lack of fear towards the Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing, Ningguang — a trait that the other appreciates, yet grows irritated by.

Captain of the Crux, with quite the reputation in Liyue.There are those who say she can split mountains and part the sea. Others say she draws lightning through her sword. Some say that even the mightiest of sea beasts are no match for her.For those not from Liyue, it may sound like a hearty joke, but those that have sailed with her will say—"No matter what sea beasts there may be, Beidou will be sure to split them all in two."—Description from the Official Website[1]

Personality
Captain of her crew, The Crux. She's quite an unbound and forthright woman.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Beidou is known as the Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean for her great strength — capable of slaying the leviathan Haishan without the aid of a Vision and earning her the respect of the Conqueror of Demons, Xiao[2] — and for leading the Crux, an armed crew she established.
Beidou is well known across Liyue for her strength, her easy-going personality, and her good judgment of character. This makes her well-liked by many people, with children even looking up to her as an ideal role model. She treats her crew with respect, who in turn are completely loyal to her. While she does not like the Treasure Hoarders, Beidou honors a "first come, first serve" rule when it comes to collecting treasure[3] unless specified otherwise. Even then, the criminals fear her and try to avoid incurring her wrath, knowing that she severely outmatches them. In turn, she gives opportunities for Treasure Hoarders to leave that lifestyle behind and start over.
The Liyue Qixing and Liyue Harbor's administrative side, however, see Beidou in a different light. She frequently violates the laws and has no problems with paying off the hefty fines the Tianquan Ningguang lays on her as punishment.[4] While the two profess their antipathy to the other's way of life, they nevertheless remain allies when it comes to Liyue's greater good and seem to in fact have a close friendship, as they frequently play chess together.[5][6]

Beidou uses the tall female model. She has long, waist-length dark brown hair and fair skin. Her right eye is a deep ruby-colored hue melting into gold. Her left eye is covered by a red eyepatch.

Official Introduction
Storm-Braving Ocean Queen
In all of Liyue Harbor, only Beidou dares to bet against Ningguang.—A truth once spilled at a family feast by the Head of the Feiyun Commerce Guild.
Almost all of those in Liyue know the mighty name of Beidou, Captain of the Crux, as she often becomes a topic of conversation amongst locals.
At the port, there are those who can give you the most colorful and detailed accounts of the moment Beidou struck down the mighty sea beast known as Haishan.
During their feasts, merchants heartily discuss the exorbitant fines Beidou has incurred bringing shipments in.
But for the crew of the Crux, the thing most worth discussion is the Mora Beidou has won from Ningguang.
While the exact figure is unknown, and the times they've bet unknown, but when the crew sees Beidou return to the ship tipsy, they know it was a rough night of drinking.
"Next time I'll be sure to bankrupt her!" Beidou would say, as she lay on the deck of her ship.
Of course, the crew takes these brave words as a drunken joke.

Character Stories
Character Details
Beidou is the leader of The Crux — an armed crew based in Liyue Harbor.An armed crew means exactly what it sounds like: a crew of sailors armed to the teeth.Without getting into too many details, everything The Crux does is approved by the Qixing... more or less.Beidou is a trusted leader, so much so that her crew believes her capable of taming the storms and billows on the sea."It's Beidou! Even the mightiest of storms must bow its head to her might!"Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Beidou is something of a cultural icon in Liyue.Though her fame does not quite reach the same lofty heights as that of the Liyue Qixing, one can be certain that every merchant in the city knows her name — and that of her crew, The Crux.Naturally, there are rumors abound regarding someone of her status. People love to tell epic tales of her earth-shattering (or rather, sea-splitting) feats. tales in which her abilities are exaggerated to almost superhuman levels.One rumor is that she can channel Electro energy with her sword. It is said that she once used it to cut a formidable sea monster from the depths of the ocean abyss in half with just one hit.Bystanders who overhear such tales generally dismiss them as drunken ramblings. But to any who has ever voyaged with Beidou themselves, these stories are no joke. In their view, if this world really were home to a giant sea monster from the ocean abyss... Beidou would certainly be capable of cutting it in half.In summary, Beidou's abilities are every bit as impressive as her reputation in business circles. So if you hear her lauded as the Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean — suffice to say that there is no smoke without fire.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
Business people tend to put profit before their humanity. This is just accepted as the way of the world. At most, it makes for some light verbal sparring at the dinner table.But things are different in Liyue, where everyone is involved in business. They reject the notion entirely, claiming that Liyue Harbor is a special place where humanity is sacred.Foreign merchants will retort that the only thing special about Liyue is that "They've managed to commodify humanity, too!" To this, Liyue locals respond, "Then how do you explain The Crux?"With The Crux having made a name for itself over many years, its services are extremely expensive to charter. And yet, on one voyage when The Crux encountered a strong storm, Beidou noticed a small private boat nearby. Seeing the way it was tossed about by the waves, she ordered her crew to tow the boat to safety — despite the risk that her ship's keel might give way. What little food and water the fleet had left, Beidou shared with the rescued crew as she navigated her vessel onward through the raging storm.Finally, after several days, The Crux delivered the rescued boat to a safe mooring spot. Grateful to Beidou for saving their lives, the crew of the rescued boat became her loyal trade partners thereafter.After Liyue locals recount this story, they smile and insist, "When you have someone risking their life like that, you can be sure that it takes far more than commodification to explain their actions! Would you really dare to look Beidou in the eyes and talk about the commodification of humanity?"Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Word has it that The Crux's boss behind the curtains is none other than the Qixing's Tianquan, Ningguang, herself.Both of the people involved deny this outright, though they do so for different reasons.As a member of the Qixing, Ningguang often needs someone else to do her dirty work for her. Of the many candidates available, she picked Beidou.Ningguang would emphasize that she picked Beidou, not The Crux. Ningguang's collaboration with The Crux is, therefore, purely incidental.Meanwhile, when Beidou hears the rumors about her dealings with Ningguang, she furiously insists that she collaborates with Ningguang on an equal footing: Beidou is her own boss and no one, not even Ningguang, is sitting in the background pulling the strings for her.Beidou is certainly unique among Ningguang's collaborators.She does not tread carefully or show reverence in the way that most of them do. In fact, one could even say Beidou is sometimes at odds with Ningguang.Ningguang's advisers worry constantly that Beidou is too unpredictable and too much of a maverick. But Ningguang simply smiles and dismisses their concerns."On the contrary, Beidou is the most reliable person in Liyue," she replies. "Just tell her the truth, as well as what's in it for her, and she'll come around in her own time."Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Once, after disembarking from a long voyage, The Crux held its customary three-day celebratory banquet. The autumn was like any other before it — except for the new chef in town. This was Xiangling, the head chef-to-be of the Wanmin Restaurant.Looking to keep costs down, they lured Xiangling onboard after meeting her on the streets, by hook and by crook. When she saw Beidou, Xiangling was dismayed, and let Beidou know this in no uncertain terms: "If you want to have Yue-style seafood, then I can't agree to help you. I'll have you know that I intend to transcend Liyue's two warring culinary styles with my cooking..."Beidou merely smiled and gestured to the chest of gold coins beside her: "Just do what you're good at. We made quite a bit on our last run. How does a retainer of fifty thousand Mora sound?"Not one to shy away for a chance to prove the worth of her cooking, Xiangling took the job.When the day was done, Beidou was indeed won over by Xiangling's skill. She declared in front of her crew that Xiangling would soon be a renowned chef throughout Liyue. She also insisted that they refer to her as "Madam Xiangling."Having only begun to make her name, Xiangling admired Beidou for her generosity with money and her direct personality. Thereafter, Xiangling would sail with Beidou often, looking for new and exotic seafood ingredients. She found herself surprised by Beidou's vast knowledge of seafood and their culinary preparation, given how far she usually was from any kitchen.Of course, that didn't mean Xiangling would necessarily heed Beidou's advice on whether something was edible or not...but that is a story for another time.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Some say an object takes after its master.Though it may not be a suitable description, The Crux crew does indeed take after Beidou, exhibiting the same qualities.However, there are still secrets among the crew, spreading in places unnoticed by Beidou.Her First Mate always takes new sailors out after their first safe return for drinks and fills them in on the details of an old story:In the past, the crew went on a journey to brave the unknown seas and found itself at death's door in a horrific storm.At that time, Beidou stood on the deck behind the wheel, singing a Liyue fishermen's song in the storm."...all the way until the waves died down and dawn broke on the far horizon..."The First Mate often ends the story with this final line and a look of longing on his face.As business grew and the crew expanded, more and more outrageously incredible details were added to the story, making the rookies worship Beidou like a goddess.Pier Laborers' Gossip Friendship Lv. 4
1. Facing a three-headed hydra of unrivaled girth, Beidou hurled forth her greatsword. Spinning in the air, it sliced clean through all three of the hydra's vertebrae, before returning to her waiting hand.2. Beidou has beaten Ningguang at chess. Twice. The important part is not so much that she did win Ningguang's money, but more that she dared to.3. Since the day she slew the sea monster Haishan, Beidou has never sung a fishermen's shanty ever again.4. Yes, Beidou knows shanties. But don't you dare ask her that to her face. I mean, you know how that hydra ended up, don't you...Vision Friendship Lv. 6
Liyue and Inazuma share a common saying: "Its fins formed the ocean deep, its tail the mountains high." The fishermen learned this phrase while ashore long ago, and sang it over and over, spreading the tune far and wide till it became the much-loved song people know today. Whenever the mists gather over the sea's surface, one can hear the distant song of the fishermen hidden in the white shroud: "its fins formed the oceans deep, its tail the mountains high..."This was Beidou's childhood lullaby. The tale of Rex Lapis smiting the sea monsters had become legendary among the people of Liyue. As a child, Beidou loved tales like this, and in her dreams, she thought: One day, I want to see this big fish too.This day, however, she sang this song with a different emotion in her heart. Her entire crew sang along as they sailed.Haishan was in the waters with them — at once like a dragon and a fish, it was larger than any could have imagined in their worst nightmares, and mighty as a deity, raising waves dozens of meters high with ease.All who ply their trade on the high seas are destined to meet Haishan eventually. Beidou had longed to do so since she was nine, dreaming of slicing its head off in a single blow.Many times she had challenged the creature, and many times she had failed. But this day was different. This day she charged at Haishan with her best greatsword in hand, and crack sailors at her back.The battle would rage fiercely for four days. With cannons and harpoons, arrows and ropes the fleet would assail Haishan, while Beidou battled the thusly tied-down creature for ten hours, well into the night.Now, nighttime was when Haishan was in its element, and in their vigilance not a single member of the fleet dared sleep a wink. Beidou stood upon the prow, listening to the wind.One strike. Just one strike. That was all she needed. And so she waited, unmoving, in the freezing wind.Then, at the crack of dawn, having neither eaten nor drank throughout the night, Beidou heard a change in the sound of the waves.With one almighty strike that sounded as if it could have sliced the moon in two or ripped a mountain from the face of the world, she chopped the leviathan's head clean off!The sound of thunder filled the heavens, and a single bolt of purple lightning struck the ocean right in front of Beidou, even as she bathed in the blood of her nemesis.Thus descended a Vision to the slayer of the sea monster, its violet glow as stunning as lightning, and its immaculate, jeweled form a treasure more precious than dragon blood. A suitably divine gift for the hero who subdued Haishan.

But Beidou liked that trick very much, saying that it was exactly what a pleasant surprise should be — very pleasant, and a surprise.MailsSenderMailsGorouThe Tournament... (Birthday Mail)

Trivia
Tea Master Liu Su, an NPC that tells exaggerated and fabricated legends, says Beidou is 6 feet tall and is "built burlier than the burliest man you've ever seen."
All the Crux's crew members on board the Alcor mention her; notably, Furong is implied to fantasize about Beidou, while Little Yue was raised by Beidou after his parents — who were members of the Crux — died during expeditions. Zhang Shun, a former member of the Crux, also mentions her.
In Beidou's official art, Kazuha's character demo, and during the cutscene in In the Name of the Resistance, she is seen wielding the Blackcliff Slasher.
Beidou grew up in a small fishing village called Downriver and had a childhood friend named Xiling. The village chief of Downriver took pity on the homeless Beidou and took her in, but a year or two after her arrival the village chief fell ill and died. During that same period, the harvest was getting worse and the other villagers turned on Beidou, claiming she was an omen of bad luck, and drove her out of the village.[7]
Beidou is mentioned in the description of the following Furnishing: "Leisurely Fireworks"
Etymology
Beidou (Chinese: 北斗) is the Chinese name for the large asterism in the constellation Ursa Major, the Big Dipper, also referred to as 北斗七星 Běidǒu Qīxīng, lit. "Seven Stars of the Big Dipper" in Chinese. The North Star, Polaris, is located within this asterism and is used by sailors to navigate at sea.
The term 七星 Qīxīng, lit. "seven stars," is the same term used for the Liyue Qixing, and the titles of the members of the Qixing are the same as the Chinese names for the stars in the Big Dipper.
Her constellation, Victor Mare, is Latin for "The Conqueror of the Sea."

She sometimes uses some... interesting ingredients in her dishes to bring about some, ah... intriguing flavors. Though... there's no way she can improve without having someone to taste-test — a role that I am more than happy to fill.

Try as we did, we only made it back to Liyue Harbor in the dead of night, long after the lanterns had all been released. As I looked towards Guyun Stone Forest, I saw an adeptus, floating in the air, in the form of what appeared to be a young boy. I guess it is like the legends say — there really must be those that watch over Liyue, even if they cannot be seen.

But as you know, she's the secretary to the Liyue Qixing... and I'm not exactly in their good books right now! Doesn't bother me, but I wouldn't want to put Ganyu in a difficult position. So just keep what I said between us, yeah?

Trouble is, when it's time for her to go she gives you the puppy eyes, and no one has the heart to send her away... Means we're always cutting it quite close by the time we manage to set sail.

That scallywag actually blocked a strike from the Raiden Shogun outside Tenshukaku! Easier said than done... After the battle he came to the Crux Fleet — said he'd voyage with us a while longer. I was more than happy to oblige. If the day comes when he decides to set off again by himself on the next stage of his journey, I'll send him off with a drink, haha...

When I was a child we had little money, so nothing to eat, and lived for years by stealing fruit off of people's trees. Even after I got my own ship, I was cast out by pompous merchants.

 Let's get to work...
 Sip of something stronger...
 Out to sea...
 If we went adventuring...
 Making new friends...
(When the player is nearby)
 Look who it is!
 How are you doing?

Dialogue

Media:vo beidou mimitomo hello 01.ogg Beidou: Hey, look who it is!
Media:vo beidou mimitomo hello 02.ogg Beidou: Your bones are still holding you up, then?
 How do you like it here?
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Beidou: Yeah, pretty good! Feels nice to sit and relax in such a scenic place!
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Beidou: But...
 But what?
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship1 03a 1.ogg Beidou: But you know that I'll be craving the billowing waves of the open ocean before too long! It's where I belong.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship1 03a 2.ogg Beidou: The churning ocean waves are the best lullaby.
 But you miss the sea already?
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship1 03b 1.ogg Beidou: Haha! You get me!
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship1 03b 2.ogg Beidou: Days spent sailing through a storm, conquering the surging waters... yeah, those are happy days!
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Beidou: Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm thrilled that you invited me here.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Beidou: I'll have to return the favor sometime by hosting you onboard the ship!
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Beidou: Sure! I'm down to chat about anything!
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Beidou: But, you must be a little weary of hearing about my sea travels from all the stories people tell?
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Beidou: Let's change it up! Tell me about your adventures!
 Um... I fought a dragon once.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship2 04a 1.ogg Beidou: Whoa, nice! How big was it?
 Probably bigger than your ship.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship2 04a 2.ogg Beidou: Hahaha, incredible!
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship2 04a 3.ogg Beidou: So I fought a sea dragon, and you fought a sky dragon.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship2 04a 4.ogg Beidou: If we went adventuring together, we'd be invincible!
 Most of them involve fighting hilichurls...
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship2 04b 1.ogg Beidou: How's that? I certainly don't see many of those out at sea!
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship2 04b 2.ogg Beidou: But adventure isn't just about how many storms you've survived in the past — it's about knowing that there are plenty more storms up ahead, and you don't know what they've got in store for ya!
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship2 04b 3.ogg Beidou: Hey, that sounded pretty profound now that I think about it...
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Beidou: Haha, this was a great chat! And now, a toast! Cheers!
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
 Anything you'd like to do?
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Beidou: What do you think? I wanna take you out to sea on an adventure, of course!
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Beidou: I can teach you how to steer a ship if you're interested.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Beidou: You know, no two waves are ever the same...
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Beidou: If you're free, it'd be a shame not to take the opportunity to show you 'round the seas.
 I'll need to prepare.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship3 05a 1.ogg Beidou: Sure thing. Just say the word.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship3 05a 2.ogg Beidou: Oh, uh... And if you've got any unfinished business, best take care of that first then call me when you're done.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship3 05a 3.ogg Beidou: One voyage takes about one and a half years, but that's just a rough estimate.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship3 05a 4.ogg Beidou: So, you should tie up any loose ends before we set sail!
 I'm worried that I'll get seasick.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship3 05b 1.ogg Beidou: Don't be afraid. Don't let that hold you back.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship3 05b 2.ogg Beidou: You'll get used to the ocean's movements soon enough. If you're really struggling, I have some medicinal herbs.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship3 05b 3.ogg Beidou: I guarantee you, it'll be fine. Trust me on this.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship3 05b 4.ogg Beidou: It'd be a pity if you missed out on a voyage across the seas because of something like that!
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Beidou: Anyway — let me know when you're done prepping, and we'll pick a date to set off!
Media:vo beidou mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Beidou: The thought of you and I conquering the seas together... I can't wait!
(Between 6:00 and 19:00)
 Good morning, Beidou.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo morning 01.ogg Beidou: Ah, I see you're raring to go.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo morning 02.ogg Beidou: Good morning indeed! Let's get to it, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!
(Between 19:00 and 6:00)
 Good night, Beidou.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo night 01.ogg Beidou: Night, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo beidou mimitomo night 02.ogg Beidou: Don't stay up all night thinking, alright? Give your mind a proper rest.
Media:vo beidou mimitomo night 03.ogg Beidou: See ya soon.

Special Dialogue
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.

Media:vo mimitomo ly beidou restaurant 02.ogg Beidou: Hahaha, there's good wine and fresh food! Good stuff!
Media:vo mimitomo ly beidou restaurant 03.ogg Beidou: Come on, join me! Tell me some stories about your adventures!

Of Hunting and Dancing

Media:vo mimitomo ly beidou hillichurl 01.ogg Beidou: It's a bit rough around the edges, but we have weapons, space, and everything else we might need.
Media:vo mimitomo ly beidou hillichurl 02.ogg Beidou: So, limber up and let's go a few rounds. Don't worry about holding back!
Media:vo mimitomo ly beidou hillichurl 03.ogg Beidou: This place ain't half bad. I like it!
