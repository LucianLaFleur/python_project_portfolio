De­scrip­tion
Chevreuse's outfit. The designers kept the uniform's classic black, white, and red color combination and added a bevy of accessories, but the result proved too heavy, which the captain protested. The final, fit-for-public-consumption version lacked most of those metal decorations.

Personality[]
The captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, who wears justice as an ever-present seal upon her heart. Her musket shall only ever point at the guilty.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Chevreuse grew up in Fleuve Cendre.[2] She is the present Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol and a frequent customer at Beaumont Workshop, often purchasing expensive materials to maintain her musket. According to Riqueti, Chevreuse has commented about the Patrol's scarce usage of Gardemeks while under her command, claiming that "Gardemeks will only block our bullets!"[3]
Chevreuse has a strong sense of upholding the law, mainly in part due to her childhood when her father, Donatello, served in the Gardes. Donatello intended for her to be his successor, submitting her through rigorous trials that were meant to frustrate and vex her which she completed without much issue, making him see her even more suited to uphold "justice" than him. Unlike the other members of Fontaine's law enforcement, Chevreuse is fairly lax, allowing members to act freely from the others. She is particularly distasteful of Gardemeks, due to them blocking their musket's shots and the potential to turn against their allies in an instant. She shares a strong bond with her subordinates, refusing to accept the idea that one of them would act outside the law without sufficient proof, and when she became Captain of the Special Patrol, some of its members began using muskets and expressing a similar dislike of Gardemeks.
Despite upholding the law, Chevreuse does occasionally stoop to seemingly unlawful acts; she bribed Emerald for information regarding a mystery shooter[2], and turns a blind eye to Chiori throwing people out her store and driving out malignant competitors in Fontaine's fashion industry in return for intelligence.[4] Her colleagues in the Maison Gardiennage also disapprove of her method of hiring felons as "special consultants" for cases that she personally investigates.
In her spare time, Chevreuse enjoys reading, particularly books in which justice prevails over evil.[5] She also has an unhealthy obsession with junk food particularly while on work, even storing them in her uniform[2]; when off, she considers them to be her worst enemy. She also shows disdain towards uncooked food.

Chevreuse uses the medium female model. She has pale skin, violet eyes fading to pink, and long violet hair with the tips all swept upwards. Her front bangs have three strands that are white, and she wears a eyepatch over her left eye.

Official Introduction[]
Righteous Enforcer of the Law
...Captain Chevreuse, once again I implore you, we must tighten up the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol's entry requirements. Right now, we count among our members petty crooks who have burgled all over the Court of Fontaine, street fighters whose only concern is getting rich, and even a bandit whose band of cronies almost succeeded in robbing a bank! If you hadn't personally caught him red-handed — scoping the place out under the guise of being an investor — they might very well have pulled it off... For pity's sake, we're supposed to be the Maison Gardiennage! Even if just to preserve our image, please consider doing something!—The ninth in a series of pleading letters sent to Chevreuse by Captain Grosrochard of the Gardes
"Behave yourself or the Patrol will get you!"
— A warning often issued to naughty Fontainian children from exasperated parents
Of course, those children are too young to understand how ridiculous such a thought is — that you might be dragged off by the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol for going to bed too late, eating snacks after brushing your teeth, or getting bad grades. In reality, the only people that the Patrol are really after are notorious criminals. As children grow older and come to learn this, these warnings quickly lose their effect.
...But some members of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol can't help but resent this type of "education" when they notice children on the street quietly slipping away as they approach. As they see it, painting such a picture of the Patrol couldn't be more inappropriate. If people are allowed to keep saying such things, then the Patrol's infamous reputation will loom like a shadow over the children of Fontaine, and who knows how long it will stay there?
"What's wrong with that?"
This was Special Security and Surveillance Patrol Captain Chevreuse's response as she sat there dealing with official documents.
"I hope they'll always remember our 'infamous reputation,' and understand the meaning behind it..."
"...That way, perhaps there won't need to come a day when I have to drag them away for real."

Character Stories[]
Character Details
In the Court of Fontaine, where the corpus juris is exceedingly well-developed — some might even say convoluted — there are many odd ordinances that can confound and confuse foreign tourists.For example, fruit tarts may not be placed directly on unheated platters, unfinished Fonta may not be intentionally placed in the middle of roads, and one must not forget to trim the claws of pet felines...Violations are thus difficult to avoid. But Fontainians are quite familiar with such matters, quickly ascertaining the gravity of an offense and deciding on a course of action based on the identity of the one sent to deal with the matter.If it is only a member of the establishment's staff, then perhaps a simple debate will be sufficient to resolve the issue; who doesn't enjoy a lively atmosphere? If it is a uniformed Gestionnaire, then all onlookers will have to suffer through an insufferably long-winded admonishment, and it's best to vacate the premises. If it is an officer of the Maison Gardiennage, then the parties involved won't get off scot-free, and may even have to pay fines. In this case, it's best to immediately clarify that you are an innocent bystander, and are in no way involved with the case.However, if the one to come calling is the Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol with her tall cap and musket slung across her back, along with a squad of Special Patrol officers...Well, that means a particularly vicious case is unfolding, or perhaps a hoodlum is to be violently apprehended, or some fiendish felon has kidnapped a hostage... In any case, the only thing to do in such a situation is to quickly evacuate in accordance with the instructions given by the Special Patrol and give these "Felon Management Specialists" room to work their magic. At the same time, keep a tight leash on your curiosity and do not attempt to conceal yourself in a nearby hidey-hole. seeking to observe their law-enforcement activities from a close distance. Even if you wish to interview them, then wait until their work is done.Most importantly, there's no need to feel unsafe, and even less cause for fear.For as all Fontainians know, any hope criminals have to escape the long arm of the law flees whenever Captain Chevreuse is on the scene.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
"If you don't behave, the Special Patrol's going to take you away!"Such is the start of many a scolding given by Fontainian parents to a troublemaking child.Children who have grown up with such threats from their parents, understand very clearly that the Special Patrol will never take action because a child didn't brush their teeth, slept in, broke a window, or swiped a slice of cake. Still, though they have long since matured into adults, they cannot help but stand up a bit straighter when they see Captain Chevreuse, averting their gaze and instinctually wringing their hands, mortally afraid that they might have committed some offense worthy of arrest without having even been aware of the nature of their crime. Yet despite being crystal clear that these fine officers are fighting crime, and regardless of their reverence for such upstanding upholders of the law, it is truly difficult to suppress the urge to tense up...As for this "fearsome, infamous reputation," the Special Patrol themselves are quite exasperated. A member once suggested to Chevreuse that allowing such an "infamous reputation" to circulate is damaging to the Special Patrol's image: "The Special Patrol is an official law enforcement office under the Maison Gardiennage, after all, and if our methods of enforcing the law are more forceful, and the process thereof more intense, it's only because the criminals we deal with are the most vile and violent of them all. So to use the Special Patrol's good name to frighten children really is a bit...""Why not let Chevreuse give The Steambird an interview? Let our Captain stress that the Special Patrol is a law enforcement organization only focused on dealing with the worst offenders, and everything it does is to safeguard Fontaine's safety and stability, in pursuit of which it would never accost citizens without good cause..."Yet Chevreuse vetoed this suggestion."If such a reputation has really become so deeply embedded in the minds of the people, and it sticks with them for a lifetime, then there's a chance that when someone considers taking things a step too far, fear inspired by our 'infamous reputation' may pull them back from the edge.""...If so, then there'll be no need for us to actually take them away someday."Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
As one of the departments central to upholding the binding nature of Fontaine's laws and decrees, the "Court of Fontaine Grand Maison Gardiennage" is a solemn and dignified institution, and all law enforcement personnel must undergo rigorous examinations and instruction. Their every word and action reflects on the Maison Gardiennage, and represents the laws of the Court of Fontaine, so there is zero room for errors or negligence.However, the way the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol of the Court of Fontaine does things is markedly different from other law enforcement agencies. Members are not required to use standardized weapons, nor must they wear uniforms outside of formal occasions... Additionally, after Chevreuse took command of the Special Patrol, many of its members began using muskets as part of their law enforcement arsenals, and some even began to refuse to go on missions with Gardemeks on the basis that not only can an immobile meka block their line of fire, but there's a distinct danger of criminals taking control of said meka and turning them against the squad. Furthermore, when selecting recruits, the Special Patrol will even accept the descendants of criminals whose households had been stripped of all honor...For the sake of quickly solving the most heinous of cases, the Maison Gardiennage is willing to overlook all those issues, displaying great forbearance towards Chevreuse and the Special Patrol. But what they simply cannot abide is how Chevreuse is willing to invite serious felons to participate in cases she is handling as "special consultants."Though Chevreuse stridently maintains that this is purely to catch vicious criminals as soon as possible, many colleagues still believe that relying on lawbreakers to help arrest lawbreakers is an insult to both the laws of Fontaine and those who enforce them. Should such humiliations continue, what dignity would remain for the Maison Gardiennage and the law itself?Faced with such pointed questions, Chevreuse always gives the same simple response:"The greatest insult to the law is a criminal roaming free and unpunished.""And as for the 'dignity' of the Maison Gardiennage, it isn't even worthy of comparison with the safety of the Court of Fontaine."This, too, is one of her father's teachings.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
"Monsieur Donatello is an upstanding officer of the law."When Chevreuse discusses her father with others, she always offers this simple, curt evaluation. This is also one of the only two impressions she has of her father from her childhood.Donatello was always busy, leaving hurriedly in the mornings and returning exhausted at night before giving Chevreuse and her mother a hug, gently apologizing for making them wait so long. Sometimes he would return exceptionally late, bringing his daughter sweet treats. Alas, having long since already brushed her teeth, it was also too late for her to have any more sugar.Such gifts were a rare treat, and yet their luster would fade by morning, and so Chevreuse's mother would allow little Chevreuse to lick a bit of cream off before sending said dessert to her father's bedroom along with a cup of coffee.At this time, her father would always be facing a wall covered in pictures and thumbtacks, at times staring blankly at it, at others pacing in circles, smoking, tousling his hair, and sometimes raising his fists in sudden triumph, before slowly lowering them and helplessly pounding the table— Chevreuse bore silent witness to all this, peeping in from behind the door.Sometimes, when she ran into her father on the street, she would excitedly wave, but at most he would return a slight smile before throwing himself back into his myriad tasks."He's an upright, good man."Her mother, neighbors, his colleagues, and even the kids next door all praised her father thusly.But one day, those colleagues who were always praising her father as an upstanding man suddenly came knocking at her door.Her mother was at a complete loss as she watched them come and go from her home. Though Chevreuse stayed in her room, from the commotion outside her door, she had already vaguely guessed that her father had become a "sinner" like those he had once pursued, and was at that moment awaiting sentencing, and might even be banished to the Fortress of Meropide."Did Papa... do something wrong?"This was the question she asked the strange adults beside her. After much choking back of tears, the reply finally came:"...Nonetheless, he is an upstanding officer of the law."An upstanding sinner.This became Chevreuse's second impression of her father from her childhood.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Even the most acclaimed authors of Fontaine would struggle to explain to a child why a suspect to whom all the evidence clearly pointed could not be convicted. Why everyone maintained their silence as an innocent officer of the law was falsely accused. Why many who witnessed the crime refused to speak the truth. And why the victim of the miscarriage of justice must pay with their own reputation and future for justice to finally make an appearance.Even harder to explain is why the path to justice must be paved with crime.But for Chevreuse, what was most concrete were the changes in her life wrought by her entire family moving to the Fleuve Cendre.A narrow room, the food less tasty, friends who now never contacted her, and a mother growing more fatigued by the day... Her father's colleagues often came by in plainclothes, bringing all kinds of gifts with them. In addition to their presents, they brought news as well. They told her mother of the appeal they were all working so hard on — not just the Gardes and the members of the Special Patrol, but even several Gestionnaires who oft worked with them — and how despite the fact Donatello had broken the law was indisputable and established fact, and legally speaking his sentence could not be commuted or shortened, they at least could ensure he didn't need to endure further castigation. It was all of scant comfort to her mother, whose worries did not subside.To take care of her mother, Chevreuse didn't hesitate to take up burdens that one as young as she should never have had to shoulder, stepping into the dark currents that swirled through the Fleuve Cendre.Perhaps it was because the residents of the Fleuve Cendre had heard tell of or been on the receiving end of her upright father's care that so many helping hands were extended to her. A well-meaning shop owner gave her a job, and the couple next door often took care of her infirm mother.And when the children of the Fleuve Cendre heard that the child of a Garde had come to live among them, they flocked to her like plaintiffs and defendants, seeking her arbitration on all manner of quarrels and disputes."Chevreuse! You gotta uphold justice, y'know!"So cried the children with one voice, before laughing as one. They did not truly intend to allow Chevreuse to determine who was at fault, but rather saw it all as merely another game.Yet the next day, Chevreuse brought a thick stack of legal materials when she went to see them, along with a notebook newly opened to the first page, and began speaking to the chortling children in a tone most serious."Very well. Let both sides present their evidence."And from that day forward, the Fleuve Cendre had one more enforcer of the law — the littlest one around. But unlike the law enforcement officers aboveground, all judgments rendered by Chevreuse were executed under her personal supervision.There in the sewers, she learned many ways to ensure that "justice" would be upheld.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
"...Then, Ms. Chevreuse, in accordance with the findings of this court, your father did indeed violate the regulations of the Gardes, leaking secret intelligence regarding a serious case, and for this reason, he was exiled to the Fortress of Meropide.""From that moment onward, you followed your mother and moved to the Fleuve Cendre... As for your father's charges, and your experiences while living in the Fleuve Cendre, please provide a supplementary statement for this court.""Regarding my experiences living in the Fleuve Cendre, my statement is as follows..."Her father, Donatello, exiled for violating the law. Her poverty-stricken family forced to move to the Fleuve Cendre. A child of a sinner, unable to work for the Maison Gardiennage, and thus seeking to fight crime as a member of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol...As the Captain of the Special Patrol was hearing her case, Chevreuse found herself explaining herself and reading her statement over and over. Having finished serving his sentence, her father Donatello was now serving in the Special Patrol. He had pored over her statement, and it had nary a single mistake or blemish.Though it had been a long time since he was ousted from his former post, Donatello still understood the Maison Gardiennage's thinking. If Chevreuse was to take up the post of Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol without issue, she would need to provide the good folks at the Maison Gardiennage with a sufficiently "decent" statement, such that they might clearly and firmly — yet with a bit of wiggle room — announce her appointment.Chevreuse was no longer a child. She knew full well that her father had leaked classified intelligence regarding a major case to utilize the resulting interest from the press to assist in investigating that criminal. After her family moved to the Fleuve Cendre, the Gardes who visited — ranking officers among them — had surreptitiously provided aid, so their situation could not be considered too dire. Furthermore, the officers and members of the Special Patrol had made preparations ahead of time for Chevreuse to learn from them in the field, learning all about the relevant work in advance...But saying all of that would be of no help to Chevreuse in taking over as Captain.Though Donatello was still uneasy about his daughter following in his footsteps, she had completed all the training he had prepared for her. Chevreuse had given it her all, passing even those trials designed expressly to frustrate and vex her.As Chevreuse plunged forward in the bone-chillingly freezing winter seas, it seemed to take every last ounce of Donatello's willpower to stand still and watch instead of running forth to cradle her in his embrace. As Chevreuse swam back to his side, trembling and shivering, Donatello knew that his daughter was stronger than he was, and even more suited to uphold "justice."But today, let all of that be washed away into eternal silence amid the waters of the Fleuve Cendre.For this father and daughter who long ago had swum together in the icy winter seas, it was now time to take a step forward."...My father violated Gardes regulations. The evidence of his guilt is conclusive, and the results of the hearing were correct."With her final assertion of the facts of the case, Chevreuse folded up the draft of her speech.Hereafter, justice would make its appearance, all in good time.The Special Security and Surveillance Patrol Type-II Standard Musket Friendship Lv. 4
Compared to the initial configuration, the improved version of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol's standard musket features a modified butt stock that better fits human shoulders, as well as a longer barrel. Some specialized Type-II muskets feature all-purpose rails attached below the barrel and to the stock. Scopes, grenade launchers, smokescreen launchers, sonic boom launchers, and all kinds of melee weapons are among the various accessories that can be attached to the mounts, allowing them to be adapted for virtually any kind of combat mission.However, while she was modifying muskets to improve the team's combat capabilities, Chevreuse also raised the evaluation standards for firearms proficiency, adding several requirements not related to firearms themselves, such as unarmed combat."The raison d'etre for the Special Patrol is capturing criminals, not strutting around showing off your gun!""What are you gonna do, refuse a mission if you can't bring your musket?"And thus, thanks to the Type-II Standard Musket, the amount of training required vastly increased once more.Naturally, Chevreuse herself completed 100% of every single training program.Seeing their captain standing strong like an ironwoman in the middle of the practice field, the members of the patrol spoke out spontaneously, yet with one heart and one voice:"Captain, please have mercy on us...!"Vision Friendship Lv. 6
The Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, Chevreuse, rarely discusses how she obtained her Vision of her own accord. To others, she says the reason is because the authority and prestige of the Special Patrol comes from the law and justice. By focusing too much on "Visions," it would only create misunderstandings. To preserve the law's standing, it is better not to discuss such things.But those close to Chevreuse know that this Vision is much more akin to a heavy burden for her.After Chevreuse joined the Special Patrol, she used her extraordinary talent and perseverance to complete all kinds of internal training programs, memorizing every rule, regulation, and standard for Special Patrol operations along with the related statutes. Without question, she was first in her class, and her pursuit of "justice" was widely admired by other members.But the officer in charge of them, Vice Captain Grizzetti, disagreed, and he never selected Chevreuse for field missions. Other members could only guess why: Perhaps it was to protect her? After all, he was once close with her father Donatello, and had taken care of her. They were so close that Chevreuse was said to call him "Uncle Grizzetti." Or maybe he was planning to groom her to take on some particularly important job?Chevreuse didn't think about such complicated matters. After the sixth time she was excluded from a mission, she could bear it no longer and finally asked the usually amiable Uncle Grizzetti why he never chose her for fieldwork."You're not ready."Came the reply."Fix your conception of justice first, Chevreuse. If your understanding of it is limited to an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, then it would be best for you to leave this place. This is not some lynching site. This is where the voice of justice must ring true."At the time, Chevreuse had not yet grasped this, nor did she even know just when she would be ready. Perhaps she would spend her entire life trying to understand. Or perhaps she would have to be ready the very next second.Soon, Grizzetti found himself shorthanded during an urgent mission hunting down a gang of notorious criminals. With no choice but to call on Chevreuse, he repeatedly warned her to stay close, follow orders, and not act without permission. And then it was time to move out, and the various members filed out into the howling tempest to close off every possible route the gang of criminals could take.Chevreuse and Grizzetti concealed themselves behind some shrubbery, but the criminals did not appear. Just as the two of them began to think their intelligence was mistaken and were preparing to withdraw quietly, a shot rang out from a hidden position, and Grizzetti was struck. Chevreuse counterattacked nearly instantly, using the muzzle flash in the darkness to sight the criminal's position before hitting them with a single precise bullet. But Uncle Grizzetti had already sunk into eternal silence.Now, only Chevreuse and the killer remained. The howling wind and torrential downpour would conceal the sound of another gunshot, and the Special Patrol... They might not inquire too closely in the case of how this fiend who had murdered one of their colleagues had been shot dead.But more importantly, the killer was right in front of her. If she wished to carry out justice, now was the time. She lifted her musket, aimed right between his eyes... and then lowered the gun.The Special Security and Surveillance Patrol speaks only in the name of justice, and true "justice" can only be decided by the courts. Perhaps this was what it meant to be "ready" to become a member of the Special Patrol."This is the Court of Fontaine Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. You are under arrest."No sooner had she finished speaking than the killer began to hobble away, seeking to flee without the slightest hesitation. With the crack of a musket, the man was struck squarely in his right leg. He cried out in agony, cursing as he rolled on the ground, finally coming to a stop before the feet of the other Patrol members who had rushed over.The "justice" of the law is meted out by the courts, but as for Chevreuse's own personal justice, that is carried out by her alone.As Chevreuse finally completely lowered her musket, she had yet to notice a Vision was now hanging from the stock.In the lashing wind and rain, its glow was not readily apparent, much like justice yet to be revealed — pale and dark.

Trivia[]
Chevreuse holding her pistol with her left hand in Where the Roses Bloom, while holding her rifle with her right, is a reference to a military pistol training prior to the 20th century. Officers are trained to use a sword with their dominant hand while a sidearm is held with a non-dominant hand; a sword requires a dominant hand for a primary (and precise) sword strikes, while a pistol is normally used to surprise their opponents and catch them off guard.
The last sentence of her Namecard description is a reference to both the first line of the Rifleman's Creed: "This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine." and a paraphrasing of a moral from The Little Prince: "To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you... But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses... Because she is my rose."
Etymology[]
Chevreuse is the name of a character in The Three Musketeers, whose life is based on that of Marie de Rohan, Duchesse de Chevreuse.
In the event Roses and Muskets, Chevreuse played one of the lead roles in Xavier's film adaptation of the in-game book "The Two Musketeers".
Chevreuse's name may stem from the French word chevrotine "buckshot," a type of bullet made of lead shot and originally used for animal hunting.
Chevrotine itself stems from French chevrotin "young roe deer."
Thefore, her name can be deconstructed into two parts: chevreuil "roe deer" or chèvre "goat"; and -euse, the feminine form of -eur "-er" or -eux "-ous."
Chevreuse is a commune in France near Paris.
Chevreuse's constellation, Sclopetum Ensiferum, is Latin for "Sword-Bearing Rifle." This is possibly a reference to the bayonet, a firearm with a blade or spike mounted at the end of its muzzle; however, in the case of Chevreuse's constellation, the blade and firearm are crossed, forming an 'X' shape.

Title and RequirementsDetails
HelloHelloMedia:VO_Chevreuse Hello.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_Hello.ogg I'm Chevreuse, Captain of Fontaine's Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. You'll excuse me if I skip the pleasantries. Is there a case that needs my attention?
Chat: MusketChat: MusketMedia:VO_Chevreuse Chat - Musket.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_Chat_-_Musket.ogg The musket is my favorite weapon. It's both powerful and threatening... sometimes the latter trait is far more useful.
Chat: PatrolChat: PatrolMedia:VO_Chevreuse Chat - Patrol.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_Chat_-_Patrol.ogg The Special Security and Surveillance Patrol isn't involved in regular patrol duties around Fontaine. The people we're after aren't exactly the type who just pop up on the street.
Chat: FoodChat: FoodMedia:VO_Chevreuse Chat - Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_Chat_-_Food.ogg "Feast-O's" are just the best snack. They're easy to carry with you, and go with so many sauces... Gonna go buy some. Be right back.(Actual Voice-Over: Oh, "Feast-O's" are just the best snack. They're easy to carry with you, and go with so many sauces... Er, actually, I'm gonna go buy some. Be right back!)
When It RainsWhen It RainsMedia:VO_Chevreuse When It Rains.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_When_It_Rains.ogg Don't worry. My musket can still fire in the rain.
When Thunder StrikesWhen Thunder StrikesMedia:VO_Chevreuse When Thunder Strikes.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_When_Thunder_Strikes.ogg Some criminals try to use the sound of thunder to conceal gun shots. But, that trick doesn't fool my ears.
When It SnowsWhen It SnowsMedia:VO_Chevreuse When It Snows.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_When_It_Snows.ogg ...Hold! I need to service my musket before the mechanism freezes.
When the Sun Is OutWhen the Sun Is OutMedia:VO_Chevreuse When the Sun Is Out.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_When_the_Sun_Is_Out.ogg What nice weather! Especially good for keeping an eye on things.
When the Wind Is BlowingWhen the Wind Is BlowingMedia:VO_Chevreuse When the Wind Is Blowing.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_When_the_Wind_Is_Blowing.ogg With this wind, I'm afraid even my bullets might get blown off their mark.
In the DesertIn the DesertMedia:VO_Chevreuse In the Desert.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_In_the_Desert.ogg The sheer vastness of the desert is perfect for keeping certain things buried and out of sight.
Good MorningGood MorningMedia:VO_Chevreuse Good Morning.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_Good_Morning.ogg Good morning! I was just about to do a few rounds of strength training. Do you want to join?
Good AfternoonGood AfternoonMedia:VO_Chevreuse Good Afternoon.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_Good_Afternoon.ogg Afternoon! Do you want to grab some food with me at the Special Patrol's mess hall? The food there really fills the stomach.
Good EveningGood EveningMedia:VO_Chevreuse Good Evening.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_Good_Evening.ogg Another day of work over, and without any huge disasters to boot. Let's grab a midnight snack. I'll lead the way.
Good NightGood NightMedia:VO_Chevreuse Good Night.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_Good_Night.ogg Good night. I'm also going to turn in soon. ...I really hope nothing too serious happens while I'm asleep.
About Chevreuse: Special Security and Surveillance PatrolAbout Chevreuse: Special Security and Surveillance PatrolMedia:VO_Chevreuse About Chevreuse - Special Security and Surveillance Patrol.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_Chevreuse_-_Special_Security_and_Surveillance_Patrol.ogg The Special Security and Surveillance Patrol deals with a whole host of heinous crimes and dangerous criminals. As such, the methods we employ to enforce the law can be a bit on the... harsher side.
About Chevreuse: Uniform Cap Friendship Lv. 4About Chevreuse: Uniform Cap Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chevreuse About Chevreuse - Uniform Cap.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_Chevreuse_-_Uniform_Cap.ogg There's an unwritten rule in the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. Any time a member dies in the line of duty, we hold onto their cap. Should a child of a deceased member ever join the Special Patrol, we then pass the cap down to them... I suppose you could call it a way of passing on a member's legacy.
About Us: Interests As Light Rain Falls Without ReasonAbout Us: Interests As Light Rain Falls Without ReasonMedia:VO_Chevreuse About Us - Interests.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_Us_-_Interests.ogg In my free time, I like to read crime novels. They differ from murder mysteries in that they focus less on describing the complicated details of the crime itself and more on the emotional and human conflicts surrounding the case. I find them very interesting.
About Us: The Law Friendship Lv. 6 As Light Rain Falls Without ReasonAbout Us: The Law Friendship Lv. 6 As Light Rain Falls Without ReasonMedia:VO_Chevreuse About Us - The Law.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_Us_-_The_Law.ogg You can come to me at any time if you have questions about the law. Actually... You should come to me the minute you have the slightest inkling that something may not be legal.I can't tell you how many idiots I encounter every year who overstep simply because they fail to check where the line is drawn. I don't want to see you become like them.
About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chevreuse About the Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_the_Vision.ogg My Vision is certainly an integral part of the way I execute my duties. For instance, my Musket has never had a major malfunction since I received my Vision.I'd say a captain who wields a musket and a Vision is more than enough to scare off a few cowardly criminals.
Something to ShareSomething to ShareMedia:VO_Chevreuse Something to Share.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_Something_to_Share.ogg Harcourt really did it, he arrested Mylis... even though she was his true love. I have to admire him for that, although... did Mylis really do anything wrong? All she did was find some jewelry and sell it off. I guess it didn't belong to her, but it's hardly the heinous crime that the aristocrats made it out to be... *sigh* It's hard to know what justice should look like sometimes, isn't it?
Interesting Things: GardemekInteresting Things: GardemekMedia:VO_Chevreuse Interesting Things - Gardemek.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_Interesting_Things_-_Gardemek.ogg Although our organization belongs to the Maison Gardiennage, the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol makes little use of Gardemeks. As for the reason... Well, let's just say those cumbersome machines would only get in the way of our bullets.
About Navia Friendship Lv. 4 As Light Rain Falls Without ReasonAbout Navia Friendship Lv. 4 As Light Rain Falls Without ReasonMedia:VO_Chevreuse About Navia.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_Navia.ogg I've heard about the murder case involving Navia's father. It caused quite the stir in the Maison Gardiennage at the time. It was the source of many disagreements, I believe.Fortunately, the truth has come to light and the true culprit has been held accountable... Justice may not always be swift, but it always prevails in the end.
About Lyney Friendship Lv. 4About Lyney Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chevreuse About Lyney.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_Lyney.ogg Lyney is quite the famous magician. We once had a case where we arrested a magician suspected of deliberate harm, fraudulent behavior, and murder, but we could never figure out his methods. In the end, we brought on Lyney as a consultant. He helped us find a crucial piece of evidence that led to the successful conviction of the suspect. I heard that an author actually used that case as the basis for their mystery novel about a magician who used their craft to commit crimes.Unfortunately... the author ended up going a little overboard on the graphic detail, and since the crime is still fresh in everyone's minds, it'll be a while before they're able to get it published.
About Freminet Friendship Lv. 4About Freminet Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chevreuse About Freminet.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_Freminet.ogg I once saw Freminet in a shop when we both reached for the same gadget. It was the last one available, but just as I was about to tell him he could have it, he withdrew his hand and ran out of the store. It might sound odd, but he fled like the Gardes were after him.
About Clorinde Friendship Lv. 4About Clorinde Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chevreuse About Clorinde.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_Clorinde.ogg Clorinde has built quite the reputation for herself in Fontaine as a Champion Duelist. Our positions are different, so I'm not at liberty to make any comments about her work. But I trust that she takes on those duels out of her own sense of justice.
About Wriothesley Friendship Lv. 4About Wriothesley Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chevreuse About Wriothesley.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_Wriothesley.ogg The work Wriothesley does is highly effective. As least all criminals know that the Fortress of Meropide isn't the type of place you want to stay at long enough to grow old. That fact comes in handy during our interrogation work.
About Emilie Friendship Lv. 4About Emilie Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chevreuse About Emilie.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_Emilie.ogg Emilie is a good friend. Her expert knowledge of chemistry has been a great help to me many times when analyzing evidence or tracking down a killer. She helps us discover information that no one else can see, like what type of perfume a suspect wore or what type of flowers they sent as a gift. She can even determine the places they've been right down to the very dirt they've stepped in... Plus, she's never been wrong.
About Chiori Friendship Lv. 4About Chiori Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chevreuse About Chiori.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_Chiori.ogg Chiori's method of resolving disputes is bit radical. But, she has quite the network at her disposal and has provided the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol with intelligence on more than one occasion. In return, I turn a blind eye whenever she throws someone out the door or runs a malignant competitor out of business. If you look into it, you'll find that Chiori is always in the right. She's just not the type to waste her breath on explanations.
About Charlotte Friendship Lv. 4About Charlotte Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chevreuse About Charlotte.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_Charlotte.ogg Charlotte is the type of reporter that really gives you a headache. Whenever there's a major case, she's always one of the first people in the vicinity no matter how hard we try to secure the scene. One time, she was even detained as a suspect for half a month, but she was still able to finish her article while in custody... I really do need to find the time to have a formal conversation with her editor about her behavior.
About Sigewinne Friendship Lv. 4 The Remains of the Past DayAbout Sigewinne Friendship Lv. 4 The Remains of the Past DayMedia:VO_Chevreuse About Sigewinne.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_Sigewinne.ogg The Special Security and Surveillance Patrol has a long-lasting friendship with the Melusines. We often collaborate with the Melusines who work in the Marechaussee Phantom. They're kind, honest, and reliable. When it comes to handling major cases, the role they play is irreplaceable. I, myself, am quite close to several Melusines, Sigewinne included.Melusines have long been one of our most indispensable partners. If there continue to be those who dare to slander and belittle their name, then they'll find themselves looking down the barrels of our muskets.
About Neuvillette Friendship Lv. 4About Neuvillette Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chevreuse About Neuvillette.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_Neuvillette.ogg Everyone knows that the Iudex abstains himself of all personal emotion when presiding over a trial. Some even say he lacks the warmth of human emotion. But the way I see it, justice should remain uncorrupted by personal feelings. Those who break the law bear guilt. It's as simple as that.
About Furina Friendship Lv. 4About Furina Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chevreuse About Furina.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_About_Furina.ogg Lady Furina once ordered us to carry out some sort of... ceremonial musketeer performance. She not only wanted each of us outfitted with special "ceremonial muskets," but she wanted us to practice all sorts of specialized drill formations as well. Luckily, in the end, she couldn't find the right song to pair with the performance and the matter was dropped entirely.

Well, talking to people outside of an interrogation room that is. If there's anything you want to know, please just ask.
More About Chevreuse: II Friendship Lv. 3More About Chevreuse: II Friendship Lv. 3Media:VO_Chevreuse More About Chevreuse - 02.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_More_About_Chevreuse_-_02.ogg The Special Security and Surveillance Patrol is just one of the many branches of the Maison Gardiennage. We have a more daring way of doing things, and some in the Maison Gardiennage are under the impression that we don't exactly play by the rules.But， [sic]I don't think the way the Special Patrol operates should be influenced by outside forces. The criminals we face aren't your everyday goody-goodies from the Palais Mermonia. When crimes are committed swiftly and without warning, like the sudden downpour of a rainstorm, we have to be able to respond just as fast.
More About Chevreuse: III Friendship Lv. 4More About Chevreuse: III Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Chevreuse More About Chevreuse - 03.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_More_About_Chevreuse_-_03.ogg The criminals I encounter aren't all cold-blooded killers and heartless villains.Most of them start off by making a small mistake but are too afraid to own up to it. In their efforts to make up for it in secret, they end up getting sucked into a whirlpool of lies. Before they know it, they're in over their heads, and they're forced down the path of a criminal despite the best of intentions.There's this line by my favorite playwright that goes, "Lies are the soil in which the seeds of crime are sown."But, he was arrested for plagiarism a few years later. Talk about dramatic irony, I suppose...
More About Chevreuse: IV Friendship Lv. 5More About Chevreuse: IV Friendship Lv. 5Media:VO_Chevreuse More About Chevreuse - 04.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_More_About_Chevreuse_-_04.ogg After my father was imprisoned, I was labeled "a crook's daughter." Growing up in Fleuve Cendre, I saw first-hand how many corners of Fontaine remain shrouded in shadow. Though my upbringing didn't garner me many friends, the knowledge I acquired was far more precious.Those who enforce the law must have their own conception of justice, one that they use to govern their actions. That is what my father taught me.And it has proved itself to be true many times over.
More About Chevreuse: V Friendship Lv. 6More About Chevreuse: V Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Chevreuse More About Chevreuse - 05.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_More_About_Chevreuse_-_05.ogg To be honest, as the Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, I've witnessed evil beyond measure. Too many times, I've seen good, innocent people get hurt or even lose their lives after getting caught up in events beyond their control... I can't help but feel angry and powerless whenever I think about them.I firmly believe that criminals must be punished, but we must not let punishment trap us in an endless cycle of vengeance.If we are blinded by our emotions and let them control our actions, we run the risk of drowning in them.Those who hold more power should be especially cognizant of that fact. We must all search for our own sense of justice, but we must also be wary of losing ourselves in the pursuit of it.
Chevreuse's HobbiesChevreuse's HobbiesMedia:VO_Chevreuse Hobbies.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_Hobbies.ogg Perhaps training? Or target practice? If I really had to say, though, it would be reading crime novels. That reminds me, I should grab the latest copy of "The Murder Files."
Chevreuse's TroublesChevreuse's TroublesMedia:VO_Chevreuse Troubles.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_Troubles.ogg I really hate wasting time learning frivolous pieces of etiquette. My time is better spent keeping criminals in check.
Favorite FoodFavorite FoodMedia:VO_Chevreuse Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_Favorite_Food.ogg I love anything full of grease and sugar. Food like that provides me with ample energy during the workday... Plus, it's a real mood booster. But, on my days off... those fat-inducing foods become my worst enemy. That being said, absolving the world of their existence also comes with its own pleasures.
Least Favorite FoodLeast Favorite FoodMedia:VO_Chevreuse Least Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Chevreuse_Least_Favorite_Food.ogg I... can't really handle eating raw food. If I'm going to eat it, then it has to be fully cooked.

Dialogue[]

Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo hello 01.ogg Chevreuse: This teapot is so much bigger on the inside... I can't believe it.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo hello 02.ogg Chevreuse: Thank you for inviting me, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). It's always nice to broaden one's horizons!
 How do you like it here?
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Chevreuse: I find it quite splendid.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Chevreuse: In my line of work, I'm lucky if I get to spend a couple of months out of the whole year in such comfortable surroundings.
 Sounds like your working conditions must be pretty harsh!
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Chevreuse: I can certainly think of several examples that fit that description. There was the time we had to dive into icy water during the dead of winter to intercept some smuggling ships.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Chevreuse: Or, when we carried out a search for several days straight with no sleep to apprehend a fugitive. Luckily, the thick soles on our shoes make them extremely durable.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Chevreuse: Then, of course, there was also the time during the summer when we had to hide ourselves in some bushes along a river while we waited to ambush a suspect.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Chevreuse: There were a lot of poisonous insects around the river at that time of year with bites that can be quite deadly. But most insect repellants have a pungent odor that, if used, would have exposed our position.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship1 07.ogg Chevreuse: So, all I could do was advise the members of my Platoon to keep their skin covered and remain in position until the suspect emerged and began to trade the stolen goods for Mora.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship1 08.ogg Chevreuse: In the end, we managed to apprehend the suspect and the goods. But, a few members of my platoon passed out from heatstroke and were indisposed for quite some time.
 I'm getting uncomfortable just thinking about all of that...
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship1 09a.ogg Chevreuse: Uncomfortable is part of the job. But we're used to it. After all, ensuring peace for the citizens of Fontaine is no small matter.
 Did you come out of all of that unscathed, Chevreuse?
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship1 09b.ogg Chevreuse: That's a given. I am the captain, after all.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship1 10.ogg Chevreuse: But... *sigh* The number of Gardes that have been injured in the line of duty has been increasing lately...
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship1 11.ogg Chevreuse: I should submit a request to the Maison Gardiennage to increase compensation for injured Gardes.

 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Chevreuse: Okay. Due to confidentiality restrictions, I can't share any specific case details with you.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Chevreuse: But I can tell you a story about the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Chevreuse: Some time ago, we lost one of the members of our platoon. He sacrificed himself while carrying out an important mission.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Chevreuse: We arranged a funeral service for him and turned his effects over to his family.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Chevreuse: The only thing we held onto was the cap from his uniform. It's a tradition. If his son decided to join the Gardes in the future, we would pass the cap down to him.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Chevreuse: One day, after everything was settled, I saw a group of people gathered outside. I rushed over, thinking there was someone causing a disturbance.
 Who was it? His son?
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Chevreuse: It was. The boy grabbed one of my Gardes by the sleeve and asked, "Have you seen my daddy?"
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Chevreuse: He couldn't describe his father's appearance beyond the fact that he was "big and tall." The boy just kept repeating his father's name over and over again, but there was little we could say in return.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Chevreuse: We all knew that his father had long been part of covert operations for the Special Patrol and hadn't been able to return home after the birth of his son.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Chevreuse: But there was something we didn't know. In order to protect his cover, he hadn't left behind a single picture of himself, even for his family.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 11.ogg Chevreuse: The boy learned from his mother that his father was an "Honored Garde of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol."
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 12.ogg Chevreuse: But, I would imagine the word "honor" meant very little to him, and that it was even harder to comprehend that his father "was never coming back."
 ...
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 13.ogg Chevreuse: In the end, we escorted the boy home, and each member of my platoon left him with a gift.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 14.ogg Chevreuse: Some gave him a pocket watch, a pen, or a badge.
 What about you?
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 15.ogg Chevreuse: I gave him a copy of my favorite novel.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 16.ogg Chevreuse: I hope that he can be like the hero in that novel one day and have the resolve to follow his own path.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 17.ogg Chevreuse: Whether he makes the choice to don his father's cap or follow a path that leads him away from the Gardes...
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship2 18.ogg Chevreuse: My only wish is that he feels proud of his father all the same.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
 Anything you want to do?
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Chevreuse: It's rare that I get the chance to relax like this.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Chevreuse: Also... I've been meaning to ask whether you would be willing to assist me with some missions. With your help, I imagine the perpetrators will practically catch themselves!
 Where's the fight?
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship3 03a 1.ogg Chevreuse: There's certainly a chance we may need to resort to violence. But, the readiness of your answer seems to suggest that you're quite used to that sort of thing.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship3 03a 2.ogg Chevreuse: Don't worry. That wasn't an accusation.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship3 03a 3.ogg Chevreuse: Sometimes, it's the only "language" people will understand. If anybody, I know that best of all.
 And the compensation?
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship3 03b 1.ogg Chevreuse: I think you'll find me to be quite generous, especially when it comes to my friends.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship3 03b 2.ogg Chevreuse: Also, in case it sweetens the deal... if the food at the Victory Feast isn't to your taste, I'd be happy to share some of my more... criminally delicious snacks with you.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Chevreuse: So, do we have an agreement?
 Alright, so what's the plan?
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Chevreuse: For missions that require infiltration and surveillance, I was thinking that this teapot might make good cover.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Chevreuse: But now I see that entering and exiting are rather complicated. So how about this... I bring the teapot on the mission with you inside as backup.
 ...I beg your pardon?
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Chevreuse: When you hear me tap on the side of the teapot, you jump out, and we take down the perpetrators together.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Chevreuse: "Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance TEAPOT-rol" does have a certain ring to it. It's decided then!
 Sorry, I can't give the teapot to you...
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Chevreuse: Ah... I see.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Chevreuse: I suppose I'll have to train you to be a proper Garde then. If you can handle it, that is.
(Between 6:00 and 19:00)
 Morning, Chevreuse!
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo morning 01.ogg Chevreuse: Good morning! I just finished patrolling the area and can confirm the perimeter is secure.
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo morning 02.ogg Chevreuse: But, it appears there isn't any exercise equipment here. I suppose I'll have to suspend my morning strength training for today.
(Between 19:00 and 6:00)
 Good night, Chevreuse!
Media:vo chevreuse mimitomo night 01.ogg Chevreuse: Get some rest, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! I'm going make a few more rounds on patrol to walk off some... recent transgressions of the food variety.

Special Dialogue[]
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.

Key to a Stable Work-Rest Cycle[]

Media:vo mimitomo fd chevreuse residentarea 01.ogg Chevreuse: This makes me feel like I'm back in the dorms at the Special Patrol headquarters.
Media:vo mimitomo fd chevreuse residentarea 02.ogg Chevreuse: All that's missing is the clothes hanging on the backs of the chairs, the half-empty coffee cups...
Media:vo mimitomo fd chevreuse residentarea 03.ogg Chevreuse: And of course, all my teammates, looking ready to pass out after an intense day.

Full Force Forward in the Forbidden Fortress[]

Media:vo mimitomo fd chevreuse meropideindoors 01.ogg Chevreuse: You know, I've sent quite a few people to the Fortress of Meropide.
Media:vo mimitomo fd chevreuse meropideindoors 02.ogg Chevreuse: Since it's a place of second chances... I hope they make the most of it and take the opportunity to redeem themselves.
Media:vo mimitomo fd chevreuse meropideindoors 03.ogg Chevreuse: Most important of all, I hope they learn right from wrong, and turn away from crime in the future.
