Appearance[]
Tartaglia wears a gray jacket that is left unbuttoned at the bottom to reveal a belt, attached to which is his Hydro Vision. He also wears a red scarf that goes across his chest and over his left shoulder, which becomes infused with a wispy Hydro effect when in the melee stance of his Elemental Skill Foul Legacy: Raging Tide.  Paired with his jacket are long pants that run down to his black boots, with one half of both boots folded down, and a chain attached to the right-side boot.

Personality
No. 11 of The Harbingers, also known as "Childe." His name is highly feared on the battlefield.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Tartaglia describes himself as "kind of a bad guy", living for the thrill of a fight and causing chaos. As a child, Tartaglia was frightened and hesitant, but he secretly desired to become an adventurer like the ones his father told him about as they fished together. After falling into The Abyss and meeting and training with Skirk, Tartaglia's personality drastically changed. Although he appears to relatively friendly on the surface, Tartaglia is a bloodthirsty warrior. The Abyss and his old master, Skirk, made him self-confident, solipsistic, and brash, thriving on the sensation of being alive. A warrior at heart, he constantly seeks ways to grow stronger, regardless of how he obtains said power. Tartaglia considers those who wish to become strong like him to be friends and takes pleasure in battling them on the battlefield. He lusts for combat and grows excited by fighting strong opponents, even if it could mean dying in the process. He uses bows because he is weakest with them, making his victories with them all the more exhilarating.[2]
Because of his pride, Tartaglia is exceptionally reliable at accomplishing the tasks given to him, no matter how difficult they may be or if they go against his values. This, combined with his straightforward nature, makes him rather easy to manipulate. Despite disliking how his plan in Liyue Harbor could potentially harm innocents, he puts it into motion to fulfill his mission in Liyue — only to learn he was meant to fail as part of an even larger plan he was not privy to, much to his consternation.
Amongst the rest of the Harbingers, Tartaglia is considered an oddball. While his fellow Harbingers prefer clandestine operations and staying behind the scenes, Tartaglia favors being front and center. He is a public figure known for attending social gatherings and even participates as an actor in plays and theater. As a result, Childe's coworkers are wary of him, while he holds them in disdain for their schemes and "intangible" methods. While he is easily capable of scheming, he only resorts to such approaches when necessary due to his straightforward nature. He also appears to treat his subordinates less harshly than the rest of the Harbingers, stating that he doesn't use lethal force against the recruits in his care nor does he threaten any of them.
Tartaglia dedicates himself to those he cares about wholeheartedly. He is unquestionably loyal to the Tsaritsa and holds her in high esteem, seeing himself as her weapon of war.[3] He also cares deeply for his family; he sends money, gifts, and letters home often. Tartaglia is exceptionally proud of his three younger siblings and dotes on them frequently, especially his youngest brother Teucer — he is willing to lie and even put himself in mortal danger, so as long as it makes him happy. Although he was once on good terms with Zhongli (even allowing the former Archon to use him as financial support), he seems to have taken his deception personally, stating he will only forgive him if he agrees to trial by combat.[4] Zhongli appears to be unaware of Tartaglia's change in opinion, being under the impression he will still meet him for drinks to catch up after the recent Liyue events.[5]

Appearance
See also: Blades of Glory
Tartaglia uses the tall male model. He has short ginger[6] hair and dull blue eyes. He wears a red Fatui mask pulled off to the left side of his head, and a beaded earring with a red crystal on his left ear. A few lighter blond streaks can be seen in his hair, with one prominent one on the left side of his bangs.
Tartaglia wears his Blades of Glory outfit during the first phase of his Golden House battle. After the first phase, Tartaglia's clothes turn from gray to black, he wears his mask on his face, and his Hydro Vision appears to be supplanted by his Electro Delusion. After the second phase, he undergoes a full outfit change and becomes larger, and his Vision reappears in the empty slot on his right chest while his Delusion moves to the center of his belt. Both his Vision and Delusion also obtain more prominent black and silver casings.

Official Introduction
Secrets From the Depths of Winter
One can trust him, but one ought not get too attached. He has unusual tastes when it comes to combat — the encounters he craves the most being those that bring him closest to his own demise.—The cautious counsel of fellow Harbinger, Pulcinella
He cooks, he cleans... He's the bestest big brother ever!—The enthusiastic endorsement of younger sister, Tonia
Warm and friendly one minute, ruthless killer the next... His shifting and unpredictable personality can leave those around him at a loss for words to describe him. But in rare, private moments, he dispenses with titles, casts off his armor and the layers of intrigue that come with it, and show his authentic self.
His name is Tartaglia, and he is devoted to the thrill and the physical feel of battle.
Don't be under any illusion as to what he might be thinking or what his intentions are. Just remember this: Behind that innocent, childlike exterior lies a finely honed instrument of war.
Like a velvet sheath that houses an ostensibly ornamental blade, his unpredictability puts people on edge.

Character Stories
Character Details
Despite holding one of the most senior positions in the Fatui as one of the Eleven Harbingers, Childe very much looks like the young adult that he still is.He is a wolf in sheep's clothing, however, for under the cheerful and confident appearance lies a deadly swordsman.He is the youngest among the Harbingers, but one of the most dangerous among their number.That said, Childe doesn't seem to fit in well with the others.As a fighter first and foremost, he is quite at odds with this organization of deceit and treachery.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
As the youngest Harbinger in the history of the Fatui, Childe is hardly bound by convention, and plays by his own rules accordingly.Though this lone wolf is not so well-received by his peers and is also at odds with their methods, his cavalier demeanor hides a responsible, watertight meticulousness.He is a proud man of his word. Even if the promise he makes is absurd, he will never break it.Be it exterminating all the dragons inside their lairs, venturing into a domain of extreme danger, or single-handedly overthrowing the territory of a nobleman...He not only keeps his promises, but does so with finesse and surgical precision. As the Harbingers' vanguard, Childe always appears in the vulnerable underbellies of Snezhnaya's enemy states, striking as a conflict is about to erupt.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
Many myths in Snezhnaya say that Tartaglia has been on the battlefield since he was 14 years old.Oddly enough, at that young age he already seemed to be a skilled slaughterer with mastery of many forms of martial arts.But more terrifying than his skill in combat was his passion for it.Perilous battles would only excite him, and terrifying foes would exhilarate him all the more.Childe's arrogance and conceit are derived from honing himself across countless battles, and from unmatched combat experience.On the other hand, because they fret about the way his quarrelsome personality tends to invite unwanted trouble, the other Harbingers constantly try to get him sent on missions to places as far from Snezhnaya as possible, so that they can avoid the fallout.The man is incomprehensibly ever in the eye of the storm, and these unusual experiences have also made him quite the show-off who revels in the praise of others.Unlike other members of the Harbingers, who prefer to keep a low profile, Tartaglia will often go to watch public performances — occasionally even becoming part of the show himself.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Ice fishing has been one of Tartaglia's hobbies since childhood.In those days, he was known neither by the names Tartaglia nor "Childe," as the Fatui call him, but as Ajax, named by his father after some hero's tale. He and his father would cut holes open upon frozen lakes before sitting beside them and tending to their fishing lines.This was no easy task, and would sometimes take the entire morning.But whether it was chiseling away at the thick ice or the long waits in between catches, he was always accompanied by his father's unending tales of adventure.These were stories of his father's adventures from when he was young, and they became the future that Tartaglia secretly envisioned for himself.So he would pay close attention, putting himself into the shoes of the protagonist of those tales, immersing himself fully in them even as they waited for a fish to bite.Even after leaving home, Ajax, later to be known as "Childe" Tartaglia, would keep up that hobby of his.No longer accompanied by the stories of bygone days, fishing instead became an opportunity to train — to hone his endurance, and reflect on combat techniques.Such long periods of meditation to refine his skills swiftly relegated the question of a successful catch to irrelevance.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Unlike what the rest of the world may think, Tartaglia was not born with his exceptional skills in battle.But he would never speak to anyone about that critical, fateful encounter of his...When he was 14, he fled his monotonous life at home with nothing but a shortsword and a bag of bread in hand.That 14-year-old boy got lost in the snowy forest.Pursued by bears and wolf packs, he lost his footing and fell into a bottomless crack in the earth's surface.There, he witnessed the endless possibilities of another ancient world. There, he would meet a mysterious swordswoman...Or perhaps one should say that this dark realm had sensed the burning ambition in this boy's heart.This darkness was something that the Harbinger Childe could never again delve into.In those three months, the swordswoman taught Tartaglia how to pass through the Abyss unhindered, and more importantly, nurtured the ability to stir up endless havoc from within Ajax's trouble-mongering nature.No one knew what happened within that darkness during those three months, nor would Ajax ever speak of this to anyone.When his worried mother and sisters finally found him in that forest, only 3 days had passed in this world.Thus did Ajax's first adventure end, with his now-rusty shortsword in hand.This would mark the end of his youth and the beginning of his days as a warrior.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
By the time he returned home, the young man was no longer the same.He was no longer frightened and hesitant but had become frivolous and confident. He acted as if this world revolved around him, and as if battle existed for his sake.Conflict often brings about change, and this capricious, incalculable change attracted Ajax like a revolving kaleidoscope.In the eyes of his father, that third son that he had so worried about had changed for the worse, bringing much uncalled-for havoc to the seaside village of Morepesok.Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Ajax had become a nexus of strife, for no matter where he went, fights and squabbles would follow — and he reveled in it.Ultimately, after a huge brawl was pacified with some difficulty and with some near-fatal misses, his father had no choice but to hand his beloved son over for conscription into the Fatui.He hoped that the strict military training of the Fatui could hone his son's temper, but wound up watching fully-armed troops getting the stuffing beaten out of them by a mere child.This was a great disappointment to his father, but it also caught the attention of Pulcinella, the 5th Harbinger.Shocked by Ajax's great strength and curious about how he invariably became the eye of a vortex of discord, Pulcinella inducted Ajax into the Fatui under the pretext of meting out punishment, ordering him to start from the bottom and take up the duty of serving the Tsaritsa.His insatiable desire for conquest would thus be constantly satiated in fighting for the Fatui, and his ever-burgeoning ego would gorge upon the elation of vanquishing mighty foes...Until at last, Ajax was chosen to be one of the Fatui Harbingers, donning the mantle of "Childe" Tartaglia and becoming one of the most powerful people in Snezhnaya.But becoming Tartaglia was far from his end goal. To someone who sought to conquer the world, this was but a tiny step in his journey.Tartaglia's Letters to Home Friendship Lv. 4
"Dearest Sister, are you all keeping well at home? Has the old man's headache gotten any better?Please send my regards to our parents and our siblings.I've sent some wind chill medication over from Liyue Harbor. It's very effective, and will probably keep him from nagging for a while. It should reach you after a few days.Apart from our father's affairs, I naturally haven't forgotten about gifts for you all.This letter should come with two kites from Liyue, a rattle drum, two porcelain dolls from Inazuma, and a crate full of various snacks.And please break it to Anthon that the residents of Liyue are just boring old ordinary humans, like us.They're not made of stone, and they don't even eat stones.Do not fret for my sake, Tonia, and refrain from making trouble for anyone at home. I will be home soon. When I have seized the seven stars of Liyue and laid them at the feet of Her Majesty the Tsaritsa, I will take the first ship home, just as I promised — and you know how I always keep my promises.Yours faithfully, Your loyal knight."Delusion Friendship Lv. 6
Tartaglia's Delusion is his old badge of honor and the proof of his strength.He still remembers with perfect clarity the day when he received his Delusion and ascended to become a member of the Harbingers.As he stood before the cold, stern Tsaritsa, The Jester, the very first of the Fatui, personally pinned this insignia onto him.It was his reward for slaying many terrible beasts, and a memento of countless battles.But it was not this that brought Tartaglia joy, for honor is the natural reward of the warrior.Nor did he pay any mind to the odd looks his new "colleagues" gave him, for the opinions and bellyaches of others meant nothing to him.The sight of the Tsaritsa on her lofty throne alone stirred the young man's heart with respect and admiration, not merely because she opened the way for him to find an abundance of looming battles, but also because of the way she looked upon him.Her gaze was cold but pure, arrogant yet sharp.She was not only the sacrosanct Cryo Archon but also a true warrior.Thus did Childe, having received his Delusion, swear an oath of fealty to the one and only Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya.

Trivia
Tartaglia comes from a large family, with an ambiguous number of older siblings (most likely two older brothers and at least one older sister)[Note 1] and three younger siblings: Tonia, Anthon, and Teucer, with Teucer being the youngest. In his official English character introduction, Tonia boasts that he can cook and clean, and is "the bestest big brother ever!"[7]
Tartaglia's birth name, Ajax, is derived from the Greek mythological figure Ajax the Great, a warrior who participated in the Trojan War, known as a resistant and strong lancer. Teucer was Ajax the Great's younger half-brother and an archer who fought alongside Ajax.
Tartaglia's weakness with bows and preference for melee weapons may be a reference to the mythological Ajax's strength in spears, while Teucer was much more skilled in archery.
Despite being the first playable Snezhnayan character, Tartaglia is located under the Liyue Harbor section of the official website, as that is the region the player meets him in. Kaedehara Kazuha, the first playable Inazuman character, received the same treatment as he joined Beidou's Crux Fleet some time before the player meets him.
Though, as of the release of Inazuma, Kazuha was moved to the Inazuma section.
He is the first Fatui Harbinger to be made playable.
He is the first character to be both a playable character and a boss.
Tartaglia's melee fighting stance and constellation names shares similarities with an Abyss Herald's Hydro abilities; both form dual blades made of raw Hydro and make similar broad, rapid slashes as they advance on a foe, and the constellation name is similar with the Abyss Herald's moveset. Given his time learning the ways of combat in the Abyss, it is possible he or Skirk modeled their fighting skills on the Heralds, if not directly emulated them.
Tartaglia is the only bow wielder to hold his bow with his right hand and draw with his left in the 'character' screen, indicating he could be left-handed.
In his Normal Attack, the last arrow which he throws by hand does the most damage.
Tartaglia has no shine in his eyes, unlike the other playable characters.
Despite hailing from Snezhnaya and making his first appearance in Liyue, Tartaglia uses Mondstadt talent books.
Tartaglia is the only character wielding a Vision that does not have a Vision story. Instead, he has a Delusion story.
Tartaglia is also known by these aliases or titles:
Red (by Xinyan)
Brother (CN: Big Brother) (by Xinyan)
Master Childe (by Lyney and Freminet)[8]
Etymology
In commedia dell'arte, an early form of professional theatre originating from Italy, Tartaglia is a stock character. Unlike some other stock characters, his role in the story typically varies, but he is distinguished by his farsightedness and stutter.
The alias he gives to the party is translated differently across various language versions. Because Tartaglia is his name, languages that used commedia names for the other Harbingers' aliases had to use a different alias for him.
His English alias, "Childe," is a direct translation of his Chinese alias. Childe is an archaic English word that refers to the son of a nobleman who has not yet attained knighthood.
In Chinese, he introduces himself as "Childe" 公子 Gōngzǐ, lit. "young nobleman." The commedia names are always translated into Chinese when used as an alias, so there is no overlap between his alias and his Italian commedia name.
In Japanese, he introduces himself as Tartaglia before telling the Traveler to call him "Childe" 公子 Koushi, lit. "young nobleman." While his name appears as Tartaglia on his dialogue boxes, all other characters call him "Childe." Like in Chinese, the commedia names are always translated into Japanese when used as an alias.
In French, Childe always refers to himself as Tartaglia and never uses his alias Jeune Sire, which is a direct translation of the Chinese 公子.
In German, his alias was translated as Graf, which means "earl."
His constellation, Monoceros Caeli, can be interpreted as Latin for "Celestial Narwhal."
The scientific name for the narwhal is Monodon monoceros.
The Chinese name for his constellation is 鲸天座, literally meaning "Whale Sky Constellation."
Traditionally in mythology, monoceros translates to "unicorn" with the more literal translation as "one-horned."
His birth name, Ajax, comes from the Ancient Greek, Αἴας Aías.[9]
Notes

↑ As noted above, the Chinese version of "Tartaglia's Letters to Home" mentions 哥哥姐姐们 "older brother(s) and sister(s)," suggesting he has at least one of each. In "Character Story 5", he is called the 三子 "third son," which suggests that he has two older brothers and an unknown number of older sisters.Alternatively, the term 三子 "third son" could be ambiguous and indicate that he is the third child with two older siblings of unspecified gender. Combined with the clue from his letter to home, this would suggest he has one older brother and one older sister, but this possibility is less likely given the interpretation of the original Chinese.His phrasing of 哥哥姐姐们, with the plural marker 们, would be an unlikely way to refer to a single older brother and a single older sister; it instead suggests he has more than one of either older brothers or older sisters (or both). If he only had one of each, he most likely would have simply written 哥哥姐姐 without the plural marker. Therefore, the most likely possibility is still that he has two older brothers and at least one older sister.

About TartagliaAbout TartagliaMedia:VO_Tartaglia About Tartaglia.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_Tartaglia.ogg A warrior must always be ready to face any challenge with his blade. The outcome of the battle is irrelevant — what matters is that you learn from the experience.
About Us: ComradesAbout Us: ComradesMedia:VO_Tartaglia About Us - Comrades.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_Us_-_Comrades.ogg Ah, I'm sure the Harbingers must know of my dealings with you by now. Oh, I'd love to see the look on their faces... Hahaha...
About Us: Weapons Friendship Lv. 6About Us: Weapons Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Tartaglia About Us - Weapons.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_Us_-_Weapons.ogg I am the least adept with a bow. And that is precisely why I must master it.

With your capabilities, you and I could head-to-head with the Harbingers and win. Wouldn't want to miss an opportunity like that.(Actual Voice-Over: Comrade, how would you like to join the Fatui? ...Actually, scrap that. With your capabilities, you and I could go head-to-head with the Harbingers and win. Wouldn't want to miss an opportunity like that.)
About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Tartaglia About the Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_the_Vision.ogg If it makes me stronger, I'll take it. Vision? Great. Delusion? Don't mind if I do. Heretical teachings from the Abyss? Sign me up.
Something to ShareSomething to ShareMedia:VO_Tartaglia Something to Share.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_Something_to_Share.ogg The skeletal-white snowscape devours life without leaving any trace. It is the invisible enemy we fight against each day.
Interesting ThingsInteresting ThingsMedia:VO_Tartaglia Interesting Things.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_Interesting_Things.ogg I once ventured deep into the abyss and came face-to-face with an enormous beast. I don't know its name, all I know is the sight of it chilled me to the bone. But mark my words, one day I will march back in there and behead that beast, and you, comrade, will be my witness!
About Skirk Friendship Lv. 4About Skirk Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Tartaglia About Skirk.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_Skirk.ogg It's been years since I last saw my master. I should hope that next we meet, I'll at least be able to force her to use both hands to beat me...
About Zhongli: Pondering Friendship Lv. 4About Zhongli: Pondering Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Tartaglia About Zhongli - Pondering.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_Zhongli_-_Pondering.ogg There's far more to that man than meets the eye. As for the extent of his power... lots to look forward to, I think.
About Zhongli: Challenge Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star ApproachesAbout Zhongli: Challenge Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star ApproachesMedia:VO_Tartaglia About Zhongli - Challenge.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_Zhongli_-_Challenge.ogg Tell me, how has Mr. Zhongli been lately? Not bad, you say? Seems he's had no problem acclimating to "mortal" life. Hmph, he sure had me fooled. Such a fiasco mustn't be so easily forgiven! The only way to reconciliation is fierce combat! What do you mean I'm no match for him? Hahaha...
About Tsaritsa Friendship Lv. 4About Tsaritsa Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Tartaglia About Tsaritsa.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_Tsaritsa.ogg Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa is actually a gentle soul. Too gentle, in fact, and that's why she had to harden herself. Likewise, she declared war against the whole world only because she dreams of peace. And because she made an enemy of the world, I had the chance to become acquainted with you.
About Varka Friendship Lv. 4About Varka Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Tartaglia About Varka.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_Varka.ogg Varka? Just the thought of one day going head-to-head with him in combat, the fabled Knight of Boreas himself, titan of the Knights of Favonius... It makes me buzz with excitement. It's a beautiful life we live in this world.
About The Jester Friendship Lv. 4About The Jester Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Tartaglia About The Jester.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_The_Jester.ogg He was the first ever Fatui Harbinger, and today he is our leader. He only appears on important occasions. As for his accomplishments... To be honest, I don't really care. I owe my loyalty and devotion to the Tsaritsa, no one else.
About The Captain Friendship Lv. 4About The Captain Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Tartaglia About The Captain.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_The_Captain.ogg I've seen him in battle before, and oh what a sight it was. Perhaps I'm ranked too low for him to notice me right now. Well, he may not recognize my strengths yet, but one day, I'll show him what I'm made of.
About The Doctor Friendship Lv. 4About The Doctor Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Tartaglia About The Doctor.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_The_Doctor.ogg I heard that he took segments of himself at different ages, made prostheses out of them, and assigned different tasks to each one. I know... all my comrades are a little weird. Well, come to think of it, if I met another version of myself... Hah, we'd have to fight then and there to decide which one of us gets to survive.
About Damselette Friendship Lv. 4About Damselette Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Tartaglia About Damselette.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_Damselette.ogg The Fatui Harbingers are ranked by strength, and I have no idea why that girl is No. 3. I'd test my skills with every Harbinger who ranks above me if I had the chance, but when it comes to her... something just doesn't feel right. Anyway, you should be careful around her.
About The Knave Friendship Lv. 4About The Knave Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Tartaglia About The Knave.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_The_Knave.ogg Look, I've got nothing against people who have their own agendas — I myself joined the Fatui to get more experience in combat. But I don't like her at all. If she stood to benefit from betraying others, she'd turn against the Tsaritsa in a heartbeat. There isn't a sane bone in her body.
About The Rooster Friendship Lv. 4About The Rooster Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Tartaglia About The Rooster.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_The_Rooster.ogg I don't know what his motivations could be, but he seems genuine about wanting to help me. He treats me just like family. Oh, and speaking of family — Tonia and Teucer are always telling me about the pastries and other gifts he brings them when they write. So while I've been away from Snezhnaya, he's kept his promise to take care of my family.
About Marionette Friendship Lv. 4About Marionette Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Tartaglia About Marionette.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_Marionette.ogg She always seems engrossed in her research. Hmm... I wonder if those machines have anything to do with her? Anyway, I've only met her a few times, but every time she looked like she wanted to murder me. I have no idea what I possibly could have done to annoy her, though.
About Regrator Friendship Lv. 4About Regrator Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Tartaglia About Regrator.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_Regrator.ogg Oh, now that guy has a head full of grandiose plans fueled by raw ambition. I don't understand a word he says once he starts talking about his theories... Eh, but as long as he keeps our cash reserves stocked up, I'm not complaining.
About The Fair Lady Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over MortalsAbout The Fair Lady Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over MortalsMedia:VO_Tartaglia About The Fair Lady.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_The_Fair_Lady.ogg I never got along with her, you know that. I guess there's not much more worth saying about her at this point. When you're a harbinger, you have to accept that death could come at any time... But don't worry about me. No matter what happens, I'll do whatever it takes to keep myself alive.
About The Balladeer Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals Not Available after The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's CallAbout The Balladeer Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals Not Available after The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's CallMedia:VO_Tartaglia About The Balladeer.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_About_The_Balladeer.ogg After he took the Gnosis, we lost all contact with him. Now comes the task of trying to hunt it down and get it back... I actually don't mind it — it means I get to travel all over. Wonder if I'll run into you somewhere along the way?

Same goes if you're a deity or a monster from the abyss. But the Harbingers? They are more enamored with their intangible methods, spending their days scheming and maneuvering. This is why we cannot get along.

That snow-white moon... My family must be able to see it too. I hope my siblings... *sigh* I hope that they have turned out to be formidable warriors as well.
More About Tartaglia: IV Friendship Lv. 5More About Tartaglia: IV Friendship Lv. 5Media:VO_Tartaglia More About Tartaglia - 04.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_More_About_Tartaglia_-_04.ogg Comrade, a word of advice: Don't go yelling stupid things in the heat of battle. They might sound good in your head, but if you think about it, they make no sense at all. I'm talking about things like, "I'm on fire!" That's the last thing we want. Fire leaves behind nothing but ashes. And you must survive at all costs.

One day, you will see how I conquer the world and crush the thrones of gods beneath my heel. In the meantime... no dying, comrade! Keep yourself alive! Hahaha.
Tartaglia's HobbiesTartaglia's HobbiesMedia:VO_Tartaglia Hobbies.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_Hobbies.ogg Ice fishing and combat follow the same principle. Patience and decisiveness are key. Though having said that... I suppose the same is true of everything in life.
Tartaglia's TroublesTartaglia's TroublesMedia:VO_Tartaglia Troubles.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_Troubles.ogg My pet peeves? Hmm, well, to be honest, I'm far too busy journeying with you and slaying powerful enemies to dwell on such trifling matters.
Favorite FoodFavorite FoodMedia:VO_Tartaglia Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_Favorite_Food.ogg There's plenty of delicious food to sink your teeth into in this world... and plenty of fights to sink your teeth into as well. Life is beautiful.
Least Favorite FoodLeast Favorite FoodMedia:VO_Tartaglia Least Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_Least_Favorite_Food.ogg Food is like weaponry. A true warrior never deliberates unduly over their choice of weapon, nor do they do so over the food they eat. Neither should you.
Receiving a Gift: IReceiving a Gift: IMedia:VO_Tartaglia Receiving a Gift - 01.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_Receiving_a_Gift_-_01.ogg Eating delicious food really has a way of taking all your cares away. Now, how should I repay you?

Receiving a Gift: IIIReceiving a Gift: IIIMedia:VO_Tartaglia Receiving a Gift - 03.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Tartaglia_Receiving_a_Gift_-_03.ogg Um, I'll admit the taste surprises me a little. Hmm? Okay... I'll try one more bite.

Thanks to your help, I am one step closer to my goal of conquering the world. I doubt even the Tsaritsa herself ever expected I would make it this far.

Trivia
Tartaglia has more differences between his English voice lines and their official transcriptions than usual. Generally, the voiced lines match the original Chinese lines.
Differences between language versions:
Chat: Test of Skills: In Chinese, he says, "Hmm... Are there no powerful enemies worth fighting nearby?" as compared to his English script, "This place is pretty dead... By which I mean, there's nothing to kill."
More About Tartaglia - II: In Chinese, he is more openly disdainful towards the other Harbingers, saying "I can't get along with such boring folk."
More About Tartaglia - III: In Chinese, he specifies "little brothers and sister" when he says "my siblings."
Gliding: In Japanese, he says "悪くないね Warukunai ne?" meaning "Not bad, huh?"
