A fierce and strong warrior, the "Flame-Mane" Dehya is considered a legend among the Eremites for her might, passion, and conscientiousness. Unwilling to be trapped by the conditions that force most from the desert to stay there, she aspires to deliver hope back to the sands that she considers her home.

Personality[]
A member of the Eremites, a mercenary organization that roams the sands of Sumeru. Valiant and powerful, she enjoys great fame amongst her fellow Eremites.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
As with all Eremites, Dehya enjoys training and sparring whenever she gets the chance. She gets along well with Dunyarzad and respects her determination, wanting to help her in any way possible, albeit slightly embarrassed to publicly admit it; when Dunyarzad tried to revive the Sabzeruz Festival, Dehya secretly sold her claymore and anonymously donated the Mora to help out. While not a follower of the gods, Dehya does respect Lesser Lord Kusanali, due to seeing how much of an impact she made in Dunyarzad's life.

Appearance[]
See also: The Lioness and the Blazing Sun
Dehya uses the tall female model. She has lightly tanned skin, sky-blue eyes with yellow 'cat-eye' pupils, and dusky blonde-accented dark brown hair.

Official Introduction[]
The eyes of a vulture, the spirit of a lion, an unbridled daughter of the desert
"Sing a song, sing along, take your sitar, let's sing all day long.""Sing my sword, sing my bow, sing my tattered ban-dan-oh.""Fear no one, fear no lad, only fear if Dehya is mad.""We love Dehya, she's beautiful and strong. Oh, our precious Dehya, we'll never do you wrong."—A song sung by the members of "Blazing Beasts" around the campfire
"The Eremites," a loosely-organized mercenary organization, is Sumeru's most powerful armed force. They consist of many mercenaries and bands of warriors-for-hire who carry out assignments independently.
One such brigade is the "Blazing Beasts," whose most renowned member is Dehya, also known as the "Flame-Mane."
A highly regarded warrior among the mercenary circles, Dehya is brave without being impulsive, and strong without being arrogant. Life in the harsh desert environment has allowed Dehya to accumulate much combat wisdom through various battles, and she is by no means your typical insolent and ignorant martial artist.
As long as the pay is good and the commission reasonable, Dehya is more than willing to take up her sword to defend those who hire her.
However, there is one thing these employers should be aware of. That is, the agreement they establish with Dehya is only temporary and purely transactional. The reins to tame this lioness is never, and will never be in their hands.
Although mercenaries sell their strength to make a living, their dignity and lives belong only to themselves.
The desert lioness is no one's slave, and her sword only follows her heart.

Character Stories[]
Character Details
The term "Eremites" does not reference a specific group or organization, but all those who are born of the desert and ply a trade using their martial prowess, operating as mercenaries.Frail is humanity in such a desolate profession. To survive, those who walk the path of a mercenary will naturally come together, forming loose bands of mercenaries.Though the Eremites are many, few among them will be remembered as legends, with most bound to be as evanescent as sand in the wind. Yet there are exceptions who, like Dehya, may linger in the annals of history.The "Flame-Mane" Dehya is fierce and brave, the lion her moniker invokes an analogy for her might. The nickname itself, meanwhile, denotes her passionate nature.Should you be planning to hire a mercenary to serve as a bodyguard, Dehya stands as a prime choice. Procuring her service runs an expensive premium, but her abilities make that a worthy expenditure indeed.Compared to those overconfident fools hawking their talents as hired blades on the street and novices capable of little more than brute force, Dehya is a conscientious professional.With all this said, those who wish to procure her services should make haste, for there is a long line of other potential clients that have need of the Flame-Mane, and the opportunity, just as grains in the desert, will slip away before long.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
All desertfolk, including Dehya, learn to master and comprehend the sands.Here, where the blue of the sky is boundless, where the gold-paved waves of the sands bleed into the cleft of the horizon, it is easy to feel how small one truly is.Even those familiar with the sights and scenes of the desert can be intermittently shaken by the forces wielded by nature, and find themselves yearning to profess their supplication upon the sands where they were born.The feeble and meek fear this land, and only those strong of spirit can find themselves drifting free upon this golden ocean.Amongst the desertfolk, the bravest, most inured to the cruelties of their existence amidst the flowing sands are the mercenaries — The Eremites.Such a life is one with little comfort or ease, so what a mercenary truly desires are those who can support them, with such covenant-kin being the equal of blood relatives.In her youth, Dehya's family consisted of her father and his mercenaries.As she grew to independence, her new family was the "Blazing Beasts," fellow mercenaries she could trust and count on.After battling together for a time, a tacit understanding forms between individuals, with entire thoughts conveyed with but a movement, a gaze.Later, as she temporarily bid the desert farewell to commit to a commission in the rainforest, she often found herself reminiscing about the moments she spent with her companions, singing by the fireside.She can rise as high as the sky or stray as far as the sea, but Dehya was and will always be a daughter of the sands.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
Before one makes any individual comparisons, broadly speaking, females are slightly edged out by males in raw physicality.Dehya, likewise, was not born with immense might. Even so, the other mercenaries have a great many reasons to hold her in high regard.Firstly, though she is not the strongest in her profession, she has force enough all the same.Should one doubt this, they merely need to test the weight of her blade. To make such a greatsword dance and flow without sufficient strength would be impossible otherwise.Secondly, she has tremendous combat instincts. It is known that the greatsword, Dehya's weapon of choice, demands a trade-off between force and speed. Should such a weapon fail to achieve a decisive first strike against a sufficiently mobile foe, it will prove more burden than a boon for the wielder. In moments like these, Dehya uses her superior insight and technique to overcome the opposition.Sometimes, she will cast her weapon aside, eschewing the edge of a sword for the weight behind her fists. She will even hurl her weapon at foes without warning to buy a fleeting opportunity. How any such moment plays out all depends on the actual conditions presented by each battle.Aside being good in a fight, she also knows plenty about surviving in the desert.The commissions that the Eremites most often take will have them serving as bodyguards against raiders without outside support, herding away dangerous creatures, and assisting their clients in avoiding dreaded weather conditions.Sometimes, they even find assignments that have them acting as guides, helping caravans, adventurers, and researchers reach their desired destinations.Dehya knows how to deal with startled scorpion swarms, how to circle around vultures to avoid getting entangled with those nimble annoyances, and how to negotiate and minimize danger when faced with robbers.Clients like it when matters are handled thoroughly and practically. To earn true praise from their employers, mercenaries must offer more than just brute capacity for violence.Indeed, the ability to overcome one hundred or even a thousand foes has its limits, for when sandstorms scour the earth and sky, even the mightiest warrior will be buried beneath its shroud.A wise mercenary knows when to retreat, and how to preserve themselves even while meeting their objectives, for doing so exemplifies the true heights of strategy.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
As Dehya's reputation gradually grew amongst the Eremites, those of her band grew proud of the fame she was earning and, during a day when everyone happened to be present, the rowdiest of her companions stated their desire to grant her a nickname worth remembering.Everyone agreed that they would announce Dehya with the new nickname whenever she won future battles, so it needed to be something spectacular — capable of spreading goosebumps through people like a skin-raising plague.The youngest members gave their all trying to come up with something. They chittered and clamored, trying to give Dehya a vicious moniker capable of instilling debilitating terror in potential clients, usually beginning with "bloody" or "terror."Dehya was not such an amateur as to think that a title alone might encapsulate the entirety of what others felt about her. But still, as if everyone wanted to kill some time on this matter, she didn't mind.As she listened to bad suggestion after terrible suggestion, she couldn't help but guffaw with laughter. The atmosphere reminded her of moments from her childhood when her father gathered his compatriots to put on plays for her, detailing chivalrous heroes defending the helpless or messy brawls between siblings to amuse everyone. There was no specific point to it, except to bring some cheer while surviving in the vast emptiness under the desert's midnight sky.And just as the chatting was starting to put her in a good mood, that old ne'er-do-well's shadow slid back into her mind. Though admittedly disgruntled, Dehya did her best to keep the curl of her lips imperceptible.That night, Dehya rejected several laughable names, such as the "Sovereign of the Sands" and "The Crimson Edge." She thought it was time to let the farce come to a close. It was just a name after all, and true mercenaries did not let such things affect their business much.Just then, an aged mercenary interrupted the discussion. At first, he snorted disdainfully at the stupidity of those around him. Then, he asked a question: "The Legend of the Lion. This story ring a bell for anyone?"This tale was, naturally, one Dehya was familiar with. During her childhood, her father had told her lots of old stories — far too many, really. She had wanted to forget everything that had to do with him, but memories are not so easily consigned to oblivion.While she was lost in the twists and turns of her past, her companions decided upon a title for her that actually sounded quite alright: "Flame-Mane."And though she loathed the man The Legend of the Lion reminded her of, she found herself halted just before she could reject the name. Was it not all too petty to refuse such goodwill on that account?Must she avoid all the things related to her father, just because she wanted to forget him? Of course not. Besides, the story had brought a genuine feeling of warmth and comfort to Dehya, allowing her to face the world with open eyes, experience all it had to offer — and those experiences had not been falsehoods.So why not take up the title of "Flame-Mane?" She could have done far worse.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Dehya is an individual of immense beauty, a fact undeniable to all who know her.She is blessed with eyes of frosted sapphire capable of shivering souls, honeyed skin that bears a nigh-resplendent gleam when greeted by sunlight, and a length of wavy, black-and-gold hair that drifts behind her with every light-footed step she takes.The desertfolk hold maidens imbued with attractiveness and vigor in great esteem, seeing them as embodiments of vitality.Dehya, likewise, pays a great deal of attention to her looks. When she finds the opportunity, should her environment allow it, she always seizes the chance to take a shower and part her person from the stench of sweat. During her leisure time, she hits up the market for personal care products, procuring powder for her eyes and face alongside other cosmetics for times when she might need them. With how she uses these consumables daily, she often finds her supply depleting rapidly.Mercenaries are typically a crude bunch, accustomed to violence with little focus placed on how they present themselves, making Dehya something of an oddity in that regard. Unable to understand why she is so concerned about her appearance, some of her companions have asked her as much.Well, what else could it be? The men of the desert smell so foul — a stench only made worse when they kick off their boots — that the nausea that follows is near-debilitating.Coated with sweat, having not washed their feet for the better part of a month, and reeking of alcohol, they infuse the air in a room with unfathomable rankness.Imagine, an entire room filled with such unsanitary individuals. Mighty though Dehya might be, she has little desire to spend her time choking for breath.As such, she sticks to a number of ironclad personal habits that separate her from the many slobs who plague their trade, leave her employers with a good impression, and keep her looking good at all times.A portion of her hard-earned Mora, likewise, is always placed into getting jewelry and cosmetics. She treats such purchases as rightful rewards derived from fruitful labor.When one is constantly surrounded by such fatiguing things as weapons, enemies, and business, a little care and gentleness go a long way toward lowering her defenses, allowing her to face the coming future with a softened heart.Though it is true that Dehya is a ferocious mercenary, she is, always first and foremost, a lovely and carefree woman.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Unlike many who leave the desert and never look back, Dehya has always been proud of her heritage. However, her identity has indeed also introduced a great many obstacles into her life.She lacked a systematized education and was in turn also bereft of any complex technical knowledge besides that which had to do with martial prowess and desert survival. Such was the case for many an Eremite mercenary.It is clear to Dehya that this lack of knowledge has constrained her people and their potential, their energies and curiosity long subsumed by the sandstorms and the sweltering heat. If she hadn't encountered the miraculous creations of the Akademiya, tasted the fine wines of Mondstadt, beheld the elaborately crafted utensils from Liyue, or the mechanical brilliance possessed by the people of Fontaine, she too would have been unable to see past the borders of her environment.Measured on merits of courage alone, the folk of the rainforest pale before the tenacious desertfolk. Avatars of determination, even after being lashed by the winnowing tongue of the withering winds for years uncounted, the people of the desert continue to live on, generation to generation, their bodies and minds as enduring as the rock of mountains, perhaps even more so.But if they lack foresight to see beyond the present and visible, they will always only be crawling about in the sand.The Mora they earn devoted solely to food and drink, their wealth flowing out as fast as it comes in, passing through them like the sand within an hourglass. The few among them who possessed foresight and intellect knew that to find a better life, changes were needed. But those individuals often cast the desert behind them upon embracing said better life, shifting to lives lived only for themselves."Why can't we be more? Why must we be bound to spending our strength — even our lives — to live just a little better?"They were made by the desert, but also shackled to it. Dehya desires to transcend such limitations. At present, she is still contemplating what kind of future she desires to seek.How far someone can progress in life is not all determined by something as subjective as personal will — Dehya understands that all too well. But she also knows that, so long as there is a chance, she will try to deliver hope back to the desert, to do something for those still living there.Though her future paths may lead elsewhere, the sands will always be her home.The Legend of the Lion Friendship Lv. 4  •  Lionsblood
According to Kusayla, when a lion roars, even the blazing sun must shiver.Little Dehya had never seen an actual lion before, so whatever Kusayla claimed, she heeded without question.Kusayla would vividly describe how the sun would cleave the land with its heat, warping mud to powder and distorting the very air in the atmosphere. Despite this, the lion constantly thundered onward, striding across this burning plain. Try as the sun might, the lion's approach was constant and unrelenting, pursuing the star tirelessly with its roaring until the light finally fled past the horizon.Such was the might of the lion.Enraptured by the story, little Dehya's eyes gleamed bright, brighter even than the campfire burning beneath a blanket of night."The lion can..." Kusayla's eyes scythed about for a moment before he snatched one of his slimmer compatriots to use as a volunteer to complete his analogy. "The lion can take out ten guys his size. Easy.""What about you? Can you beat the lion?" Little Dehya asked Kusayla."Hard to say, but I know quite a few tricks, so I think should be able to give that beast the business." Caution lit Kusayla's expression, betraying no hint of boasting."If the lion charges me, I'll... dip down beneath it, angle myself under its body, and then... Open its stomach with my blade. That should be enough to do it in."Unsatisfied with mere words, Kusayla called upon another of their band to pretend to be a lion, planning to give a personal performance for a triumph most hypothetical. Unfortunately, their acting left much to be desired, with the "lion's" roars crippled by a lack of presence, sounding more dog-like than anything.Dehya was unsurprised. She knew what kind of character her father was. It was folly to take all he said seriously, and only disappointment awaited if one did so. All she really had to do was laugh along with him.The Legend of the Lion, however, did linger in her recollections.Many years later, just as Dehya and her companions were deciding what title would sound best for her, the Lion was mentioned, pulling her back to this childhood fable, and her father, who had put everything into the form of a play for her.Though she had been estranged from Kusayla by then, she couldn't help but indulge in the nostalgia of her youth.Now, she finally understood what her father felt in his heart all those years ago, though he was now gone, adrift in the Eternal Dreamland.This would prove one regret she would not be able to reverse. But still, one must veer toward optimism, for bitterness did not suit the lifestyle of one working in the desert. Besides, the memories of her preadolescence were now things she could openly look back upon with a sense of satisfaction.Recalling her girlhood, Dehya's eyes couldn't help but light up just as they had beside the campfire beneath the night sky all those years ago.She would become a lion, akin to the one told of in Kusayla's story, so that the legend might yet live on through her.Vision Friendship Lv. 6  •  Lionsblood
Dehya isn't all that sure when her Vision manifested precisely, but she guesses that it might have appeared when she had just started walking her own path.During that time, she was consumed with thoughts of growing stronger.As a mercenary, being weak meant not being able to take on enough commissions, which in turn meant no Mora for food.It was during this critical juncture that the Vision appeared by her side. With how stretched for Mora she was, she even considered trading it in for actual currency.People all say that to be granted a Vision is a sign of divine favor, but Dehya felt that if she was truly chosen, the gods would have sent her Mora instead of some trinket that lacked instant monetary value.Additionally, though the Vision can help her direct the elements, victory in a true battle is still decided by skill, judgment, strategy, and physical conditioning.There are many legendary mercenaries who achieved such renown even without a Vision, relying only on training and grit.Dehya likewise understood that, should one become overcome by pride at having the gods' favor, stop thinking things through, and fail to appreciate that which is before them, no enemy would be required to punish such hubris. The desert itself would exact vengeance upon such folly on its own.The things she would experience thereafter would serve as further proof that even divine power has limitations. For all their might and wisdom, even a god might be constrained.Dehya likes her Vision, but she will not bend to become an apostle after a mere brush with divine attention.She is a mercenary. Someone who lives and dies by the blade. Such a person trusts only in the sweat shed to feed countless gardens of battle and bloodshed.

Trivia[]
Dehya is the first Pyro character to use the Tall Female model.
Etymology[]
Dehya's name is likely a reference to Dihya, queen of the Aurès kingdom in the late 7th century. She is known notably for her resistance of the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb.
Dihya's father, Kusaila, likely inspired the name of Dehya's father Kusayla.

Sadly, you get some mercs throwing the term around to take advantage of outlanders who don't know any better... Hmph. We've got those jerks to thank for the increasingly abysmal reputation we have these days.

But he also saved me from the desert, and did whatever he could to pass on to me everything he had.Without him, I wouldn't be who I am today.

Hmm... I dunno, after everything we've been through, all the battles we've faced together? Somehow, "friends" just doesn't quite do it justice.I think... yeah, "comrades-in-arms" sums it up best for me. The bond we share can only be forged in the heat of battle. It's one of the most unbreakable bonds there is.

I used to go crazy for them as a kid... but my dad was the worst at shelling them. He'd just hack 'em to pieces with his knife, leaving a bunch of inedible mush behind. In the end, he'd salvage what he could by scraping pieces of the flesh off the shell, then mixing it with some milk and calling it porridge....I do miss the taste of that porridge sometimes... and I miss that old nut-cracker, too.

I came thiiis close to doing a job for that guy. A contact put us in touch — I was supposed to be his guide through the desert for some kind of investigation. But then it got canceled out of the blue, no idea why. Wait, actually... I think there was something about him not being good with the heat? I'm not sure, but it could have been that...

You know, I always thought the Akademiya's worst were just a bunch of greedy dogs, each fighting for their slice of the pie... Nope. Turns out they were a vicious pack of wolves who betrayed the whole nation. If you want my opinion... Lesser Lord Kusanali was too good to them. Those animals didn't deserve her mercy — she should've broken every single bone in their bodies! Instead, they got a nice little vacation in the rainforest... To say they got off lightly is just putting it mildly.

I love her to bits, but she can be as stubborn as a Sumpter Beast sometimes. I keep telling her she oughtta cut herself some slack, take some time off, maybe go take a walk around Sumeru City, buy herself some nice new clothes or jewelry... but she always says the same old thing: She can't bear to leave the village unprotected. I dunno how many times she's turned me down now. Ugh, if I really can't persuade her, I guess I'll just have to watch the village for her sometime, and get one of my Eremite girls to take her shopping...

She offered me some of her face powder last time I saw her, but I didn't have the time to go fetch it. So I told her to give it to Candace instead. Hmm... I wonder how she's liking it? I need to go check sometime...

I've heard that her prices aren't cheap, but is it true that she can get a hold of anything you want? Hahaha, then I should start talking to her, 'cause uh... some of the supplies we mercs need are impossible to get anywhere else on the market, no matter what you're willing to pay.

I ran into her once at an oasis on the outskirts of the desert. She was out with some group from the Akademiya doing astronomical observations, or something. I wasn't really paying attention. ...Huh? Candace... what now? Emissary from the stars? The heck is that all about? Almost sounds like she didn't wake up before getting out of bed.

Ahh, sorry, no — I'm no expert in mysterious organizations like that. Seen him a few times in the desert though. He's very down-to-earth. Once when my guys got into some trouble in the desert, he was kind enough to share his drinking water with them. Nice guy.

As a little girl, I had a wooden sword for a toy. Everyone I knew growing up was either a merc or on their way to becoming one, and even the bowls we ate our meals from were carved by mercenary blades...

The work itself is one thing, but the worst part is trying to get your client to pay you after you finish the job. The Akademiya's top of my list — they're pretty straightforward. The Adventurers' Guild isn't too bad either. But trading merchants can be a total nightmare. They're always telling me that their funds are tied up, so cash is tight, yadda yadda. "Just a few more days," they say.If cash is so tight, how'd you pay for that big pile of goods on your cart, hmm? Tsk.

I heard that they even released a ton of new regulations to support the desert folk. Hmph, it'd take me till the end of time to read and understand all that documentation... I just hope from now on, the Wall of Samiel will only mark the place where sandstorms end, rather than my folks' hopes and dreams.

They take on the hardest jobs they can find, hoping to earn as much Mora and prestige as possible. Some are lucky enough to survive and become legends, while others disappear into the desert before anyone's learned their name.I don't have any grand aspirations though. I just want to keep the people I care about safe, so they can live their lives in peace. Of course, I won't complain if I can make some extra Mora along the way, haha.

Dialogue[]

Media:vo dehya mimitomo hello 01.ogg Dehya: I'll admit it's cozy here, but there's not a whole lot to do... I'm already getting bored...
Media:vo dehya mimitomo hello 02.ogg Dehya: Oh? Look who finally showed up. Any chance you've got an exciting gig for me, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 How do you like it here?
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Dehya: Haha, beats living in the desert. No crazy temperatures, no howling gales, no sandstorms...
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Dehya: Plus, you don't have to keep an eye out for monsters popping out of the ground or vultures swooping down from the sky.
 Is life in the desert that rough!?
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Dehya: There's no getting around these things if you wanna survive out there.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Dehya: You also can't forget to keep your guard up in case of troublemakers...
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Dehya: Whoa, what's with that look on your face? Scared stiff?
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Dehya: Relax, you've got me. Just bring me along the next time you go to the desert, and I'll handle everything for ya.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Dehya: Gladly, beats standing here twiddling my thumbs.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Dehya: Hmm... Hey, do you know about the siltwater lakes in the desert?
 Are they like the ones at Sobek Oasis?
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Dehya: Uh, not exactly.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Dehya: Siltwater lakes usually appear farther inside the desert. According to some very tall tales, they're believed to be Al-Ahmar's blessings.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Dehya: Legend has it that when his followers got lost in the desert, Al-Ahmar would command the underground rivers to rise to the surface, forming lakes for the trapped to quench their thirst...
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Dehya: But it's just an urban legend.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Dehya: The water in siltwater lakes does originate from groundwater, but it's too bitter to be used for drinking.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Dehya: Besides, these lakes only exist for a short time before they're buried by sand, so you can't use them as landmarks.
 So do they have any purpose?
 Other than being treated as tourist attractions...
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Dehya: I heard that the Adventurers' Guild did once receive a commission related to siltwater lakes.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Dehya: As for what the commission was about... I guess some outlanders who were visiting Sumeru wanted to visit the desert and see these lakes for themselves.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship2 11.ogg Dehya: So, they hired a group of experienced Guild adventurers to escort them through the desert.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship2 12.ogg Dehya: After that... Well, some say the Adventurers' Guild has never accepted similar commissions ever since.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
 Anything you want to do?
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Dehya: You mean here? Uh, I can't think of anything in particular...
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Dehya: If I had to pick something, I guess I'd like to explore this place thoroughly.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Dehya: I mean, this is my first time inside a teapot. I doubt anyone would believe me if I told them.
 What do you usually do in your spare time?
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Dehya: Maintain my weapons, check my next job, sneak in a quick nap.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Dehya: If there's still time to burn, I'll grab a few drinks at the city tavern, but I usually don't have that much free time.
 Being a merc isn't easy...
 You're overworking yourself...
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Dehya: That's life for ya. Everyone's stressed out one way or another, and there's no escaping it.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Dehya: Even more so for mercs — we're looking for our next job before we even finish our current one.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Dehya: With so many competitors in this line of work, laziness will only net you an empty stomach.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Dehya: Hahaha, okay, enough serious talk. Days off are few and far between, so it'd be a waste not to unwind while I still can.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Dehya: Hmm... Why don't you show me around and introduce me to the others here?
Media:vo dehya mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Dehya: Especially that little bird named Tubby. Looks like she has her own teapot, what's up with that?
(Between 6:00 and 19:00)
 Morning, Dehya.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo morning 01.ogg Dehya: You look like you're raring to go. Not surprising, given how comfy this place is. I slept like a log last night.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo morning 02.ogg Dehya: I usually get woken up by random loud noises, so it was a surprise to wake up naturally this morning. To be honest, it's quite an unfamiliar experience.
(Between 19:00 and 6:00)
 Good night, Dehya.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo night 01.ogg Dehya: Time for you to turn in already? Off you go, then. I'll be looking around some more.
Media:vo dehya mimitomo night 02.ogg Dehya: I know you said it's perfectly safe here, but to go to bed without someone on lookout... I don't think I'm used to that yet.

Special Dialogue[]
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.

The Traveling Troop's Pomp[]

Media:vo mimitomo xm dehya barracks 01.ogg Dehya: Mercs camping in the wild rely on banners and weapon racks to protect themselves.
Media:vo mimitomo xm dehya barracks 02.ogg Dehya: Normally, any reasonable merc will know to keep their distance when they see another group's banner.
Media:vo mimitomo xm dehya barracks 03.ogg Dehya: However, if a not-so-reasonable person insists on approaching, that's when the weapon racks come in handy.

Fervid Aroma[]

Media:vo mimitomo xm dehya kabobrestaurant 01.ogg Dehya: Did you really shove an entire kebab shop in here? It's got everything: tools, equipment, even a table and chairs.
Media:vo mimitomo xm dehya kabobrestaurant 02.ogg Dehya: Since you've got everything ready... I say, let grill master Dehya take it from here.
Media:vo mimitomo xm dehya kabobrestaurant 03.ogg Dehya: What? I can't hunt any of the animals here? Okay, fine. Then I'm gonna head out and find some fresh meat.
