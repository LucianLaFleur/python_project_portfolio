Extremely strong and reliable, Noelle is considered to be "the maid of all maids" in the Knights of Favonius, with many thinking she has the ability to be everywhere all at once. She is stubborn, however, and willing to unnecessarily endanger her life at any moment to help someone. She has tried many times to join the ranks of the Knights of Favonius to accomplish her dream of becoming a full-fledged knight, but has fallen short every time so far.

OverviewLoreVoice-OversOutfitsCompanionGallery
Like most of Mondstadt's young people, Noelle always dreamed of being a knight of Favonius when she grew up.She may not have what it takes to be a knight just yet, but she is learning. Working as a maid at the Knights' headquarters, she is constantly taking notes on what constitutes knightly speech, knightly conduct, and knightly customs.She holds firm to her belief that one day she will join their ranks — she just needs to keep trying her hardest at everything she does.—Description from the Official Website[1]

Personality
A maid who faithfully serves the Knights of Favonius. She dreams of joining their ranks someday.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Noelle is a polite young woman and professional maid, helping those in need without hesitation, regardless of how far they are or what they need done, as long as they say her name. She has a very high standard of work ethic, as she always strives to ensure that everyones' needs are satisfied and always makes the effort to go over their expectations. No work is a problem for her; Lisa believes that the more work she is given, the happier she is.[2]
Despite this, she is relatively stubborn and inexperienced; she states that she is useless in an argument and simply does what she believes is best, regardless of the other party's advice. Likewise, her attempts to meet everyone's needs is double-edged; although most people are genuine, others can take advantage of her generosity. Jean also considers her to be eligible for the Knights, but refrains from knighting her because she is worried that she is not ready for what lies outside Mondstadt.[3]
She looks up to all of the Knights and asks them for advice on how to be a proper member when she officially joins, regardless of how much experience they may have, such as the rambunctious Klee. Her aspiration of joining them means that she will refuse any other invitations offered to her.[4]

Appearance
See also: Armored Rose
Noelle uses the medium female model. She has short, neck-length pale gray hair with a straight fringe and lopsided locks of hair framing her face. A section of hair is braided over her bangs and pinned down at the right side of her face with a gold shield clip. Her eyes are olive green.

Official Introduction
A Maid's Job Knows No Bounds
Jean's job is definitely the most stressful. But Noelle's is by far the busiest.—Kaeya, who in contrast to both Jean and Noelle seems quite the man of leisure
▌Maid of Favonius · Noelle
A Maid's Job Knows No Bounds
========================
Many people in Mondstadt think there's something a little bit magical about Noelle: She seems to have the ability to be everywhere at once, and to do absolutely anything she sets her mind to.
Whether it's a Knights of Favonius dinner party, a winery banquet, or just an ordinary barbecue, Noelle is a whirlwind of helpfulness that will burst through your door at the first sign of a problem and whisk it away for you.
It's no wonder that people have taken to calling her the "Wondermaid."
But ask Noelle and she'll tell you there's nothing wondrous about the way she works, let alone magical. She just takes pride in her work and is constantly in pursuit of perfection.
"Nothing more, nothing less. Just as it should be, and not as it should not be."

Character Stories
Character Details
Noelle has much greater dreams and ambitions than other maids in the Knights of Favonius.Like anyone else in this city protected by the Knights of Favonius, she too dreams of donning the honored armor.Even if her skills are not enough to pass the rigorous selection trials, she still wishes to observe and learn from them every chance she gets.Aside from her training, she enjoys her current life, helping everyone in need."You can leave absolutely anything to me!"That's her signature line. If there's anything that you need, Noelle is glad to be of aid.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Noelle is "the maid of all maids" to many.Such people also tend to say this of her: "She's everywhere."For example, there was a child who once tried to get a plate during a banquet, but found that there was no way to open the cabinet without all the plates falling out..."Noelle!!!!!!"All the child needed to do was scream, and Noelle appeared. She put the cabinet down on its back, took a plate out, and handed it to the child, reminding him not to have cold drinks immediately after having barbecue. Then she righted the cabinet, cleaned up other plates, and then put them back in order.Noelle's ability to be everywhere all at once is something miraculous to many.However, the job of a maid is no myth or legend. Noelle only does her job to the letter."No more, no less. As it should be, not as it should not be."Noelle doesn't think herself special, only that she thinks too much at times.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
Noelle is always eager to help, sometimes excessively so.If you were to ask her how to build a campfire as she passed by, she would not only stop and build the campfire for you, she would also put up the grill racks, season the food, cook it for you, taste it herself to make sure it's done, and remind you to put out the fire when you've finished so as not to burn the forest down. Then she would get back to whatever she had been doing beforehand.Of course, most people don't mind at all that she regularly goes the extra mile. But it can sometimes produce unexpected results...For example, a merchant from Snezhnaya once came to Mondstadt, ostensibly wishing to get into the winery business. In truth, he had an evil plot to ruin the land, destroy the winery business in Mondstadt altogether and then seize the market with wines from Snezhnaya.He disguised himself as an honest merchant with his family on a business trip to Mondstadt. Naturally, with them being visitors from afar, Noelle gave them a warm reception.Initially, the merchant was delighted with Noelle's hospitality; it was a cut above the crude etiquette he had come to expect from most peasants in Mondstadt. However, after a while he began to feel that something was amiss.Noelle seemed to be able to read his mind: She correctly guessed his schedule, cooked his family's favorite Snezhnayan dishes for them each day, and even knew that his daughter liked to go to bed hugging a ragdoll, presenting her with a hand-made doll she had sewn together herself.This spooked the merchant, and made him hesitant to execute the next phase of his plan. Noelle's warm smile now chilled the merchant to the bone. What else did she know, and what was she really planning?In the end, the merchant fled Mondstadt with his family.Noelle was upset for a few days, thinking she had somehow insulted her guests. Little did she know that all of Mondstadt was indebted to her for taking her job so seriously.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4  •  Song of the Dragon and Freedom
Most of the time, Noelle's reliability provides a comforting presence, but there are always exceptions.Once, she learned that an adventurer was trapped on Dragonspine, so she decided to mount a rescue by herself.The snowstorm that day was terribly fierce, wiping out any tracks left by humans as soon as they were made. It was impossible to find a safe route to proceed, to say nothing of saving the adventurer amidst the snow.However, Noelle persisted on searching for the adventurer and eventually found him inside a cave, suffering from severe hypothermia.At the time, her coat was completely soaked, and the water inside her bottle had turned to ice. Thirsty and hungry, Noelle still managed to carry the adventurer down on her back.The adventurer was saved, but Noelle, having over-exerted herself, laid in bed for three days straight, suffering from a high fever. Everyone in the Knights of Favonius barely slept out of concern for her during that period. Fortunately, Noelle recovered.It was not the first or second time that something similar had happened, and everyone was deeply worried for Noelle.In order to prevent Noelle from putting herself in harm's way again, Jean had to invent some safe jobs to keep Noelle busy. If something were to happen, then Kaeya would have to save the day.During the Stormterror threat, Noelle was also eager to resolve the threat at its source. However, Kaeya managed to arrange quite a few "urgent matters" for her to attend to inside the city until it was all over.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Noelle's petite form does a good job of hiding her great strength.This does not just refer to her resoluteness or her indomitable spirit, but also her physical strength.Once, Lisa accidentally dropped her experimental apparatus under her bookshelf and troubled over whether she could remain decent while bending over to retrieve it. Noelle made it over in the nick of time, lifting the full bookshelf with only one hand — and not a single book fell out between her hefting it and putting it down.There was another incident in which several cargo-bearing carts were attacked by Pyro Slimes as they tried to pass through Mondstadt's side gate. As the owners were all in a panic, it was Noelle again who came to the rescue — hurling the carts — cargo and all, into the Cider Lake, before leaping into the water herself and retrieving every last item.Rumor has it that when Noelle was studying the blade, she nearly sent Wagner — who prided himself in his forging skills — into despairing seclusion.In all, he forged over ten different swords with different alloy compositions for Noelle, but all would lose their edge after a few uses.At first, Wagner thought Noelle unskilled, but eventually found that the problem was more foundational: the swords just weren't strong enough.Putting his reputation on the line, Wagner finally made Noelle a sturdy and heavy claymore that was further reinforced by her affinity for Geo. Only then was her weapon issue (barely) solved.But don't worry, Noelle won't use her superhuman strength unless the situation calls for it, as she is a pacifist at heart.They say, however, that the very day Noelle received her custom-made claymore, she was set upon by a pair of drunken Treasure Hoarders in Drunkard Gorge, who thought her a harmless lamb...Let's just hope that no one else will ever be so unlucky.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Noelle's greatest enemy, curiously, is not a person, but Ludi Harpastum itself.During Ludi Harpastum, long tables arranged in a circular shape and filled with all kinds of food will be set up in the plaza before the Cathedral for everyone to enjoy.The food is usually prepared by volunteers who can cook. During this time, Noelle, who always holds herself to a high standard, joins the volunteers in continuously cooking and serving food.It's not really any additional work; what's difficult is that she insists on tasting every dish to make sure they are up to standard.The crispy Moon Pies; the sizzling Mondstadt Pork Chops; the towering Pile 'Em Ups — all the fried and barbecued foods, equal parts delicious and fatty, are customary at the festival.The smiles on people's faces make Noelle truly happy. What makes her less so is seeing her bulging belly. She can't help but let out a sigh.For the entire month following the festival, Noelle will volunteer for the Knights of Favonius' city night patrol.The festival may be over, but her battle is only beginning."Warning of Roses" Friendship Lv. 4
The maids of the Knights have many "red lines" that are not to be crossed, and one of these is that "the personal information of the Knights must be kept in strict confidence."This does not only require restricting outsider access to such information — this restriction also applies to other members of the Knights.For example, what Jean keeps in her private quarters, the contents of Amber's Baron Bunny, the number of special eye patches that Kaeya owns, the number of Klee's hidden bomb caches... These things are all top secret.To avoid leaking such information, Noelle used red cloth to make a great many roses — in Mondstadt, this flower means "my lips are sealed."She specially wove one such rose into her gauntlet as an ever-present reminder to herself.Revealing secrets would be a major dereliction of duty for a maid, and those who aspire to be knights cannot afford such errors.So you can forget about probing Noelle for any secrets. She won't tell.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
Noelle did once wish to fulfill her dream before its time. Some years ago, after failing her seventh selection test, which was really a foregone conclusion, she felt somewhat discouraged.The etiquette, swordsmanship, the lines she had memorized... had they all gone to waste? She remembered all the strong points of every official knight, but who would remember the hard work of a failure like her?She had never stopped aspiring to become a Knight of Favonius, but her exhausted body wouldn't let her get back on her feet like she normally would. She felt like someone who had spent days and nights traveling through an icy tundra.At that moment, the main gate of the Knights Headquarters were flung upon, and out walked Acting Grand Master Jean, who had just been in charge of the selection process.Without a thought, Noelle gave a precise knight's salute.Immediately, she knew that this was too abrupt a thing to do, and wondered what Jean might think of her.But just as she was wishing that there was some hole she might crawl into to flee, Jean stopped in her own tracks and returned the salute.After a moment's surprise, Noelle gave a strained smile, clumsy but pure.This was a lucky day that she would always remember, for she would receive recognition from two all-important sources this day: once from Jean, and the other from the gods.Her hard work had been remembered after all.From that day forward, Vision in hand, Noelle reaffirmed her belief that she would one day be able to don that armor. That she would be gentle and reliable — and yes, everywhere at once too.

Oh, and no swimming right after a meal. Haha, I do hope you're not thinking, "that's too much trouble I'll just leave it to Noelle," are you? ... Oh... but of course, if you are... Well then, just leave it to me.

About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Noelle About the Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Noelle_About_the_Vision.ogg To be honest, I'm feeling a little dejected. Sure, this Vision proves that the Archons think I'm worthy, but why is it a Geo Vision? I mean, Geo's the furthest thing from Anemo, and for a Knight of Favonius...
Something to ShareSomething to ShareMedia:VO_Noelle Something to Share.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Noelle_Something_to_Share.ogg I actually really like the smell of wine, I'm just not of drinking age yet. There have been a few times when I could have had a little taste if I'd wanted, and no one would ever have known... but I resisted the temptation. I feel like the first time you try it is probably really magical, so I want to save it till I'm older.
Interesting ThingsInteresting ThingsMedia:VO_Noelle Interesting Things.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Noelle_Interesting_Things.ogg A maid is required to keep everyone's secrets. That's why my favorite flower is the rose. Here in Mondstadt, the rose represents the saying "As wine bottles are corked, so too are my lips sealed." It reminds me to— What? ...Roses represent love in your hometown? I—I had no idea the rose held such a... passionate meaning.
About Amber Friendship Lv. 4About Amber Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Noelle About Amber.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Noelle_About_Amber.ogg I really look up to Amber. Not only is she an accomplished knight, but she's a kind person too. She taught me how to make a Baron Bunny. I keep it on my person for luck, and it looks quite alright I think. Oh no, please do not be alarmed. There's no risk of explosion whatsoever.
About Klee Friendship Lv. 4About Klee Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Noelle About Klee.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Noelle_About_Klee.ogg I've always been curious as to how she managed to become a fully-fledged knight at such a young age. I actually went to ask her for tips once, but I'd barely started talking to her when she grabbed me by the hand and took me outside the Knights headquarters to play with bombs. I thought it was some kind of training exercise at first, but Jean found us, and we both ended up in a solitary confinement...
About Jean Friendship Lv. 4About Jean Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Noelle About Jean.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Noelle_About_Jean.ogg Master Jean has always been my role model, both in terms of ability and dedication. She holds herself and others to the same high standards, so if there ever comes a day when I meet with her approval, it will be the ultimate acknowledgment of all my efforts so far. Until then, there's no room for complacency!

But the Grand Master said no — it would give him more peace of mind if I stayed behind to take care of things in Mondstadt. It made me so happy to hear how much he values me! ...Okay, so apparently he said the same thing to a lot of people. But that doesn't change the fact he prizes me too!

He comes and goes like the wind, and is always occupied with important business. I like the fact that he delegates some of the smaller jobs to me sometimes, it's nice to feel like part of the team, you know... What do you mean, "errand runner"? I don't see it like that at all! Okay, well yes, technically I run errands for him. But still, I really appreciate it!
About Bennett Friendship Lv. 4About Bennett Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Noelle About Bennett.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Noelle_About_Bennett.ogg He's asked me to join the Adventurers' Guild more than a few times, saying that life there would suit me better than with the Knights of Favonius. While I could help him take care of his "dads" like the other adventurers... the Knights hold a special meaning for me, and I'm not ready to give up on becoming one yet. No, I simply cannot accept his offer.
About Fischl: Tea Friendship Lv. 4About Fischl: Tea Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Noelle About Fischl - Tea.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Noelle_About_Fischl_-_Tea.ogg I think she's from another world, but I don't know the details. One thing I do know, however, is that she loves the Knights of Favonius' library. She can always be found there with her nose in a book. I bring her some refreshments whenever I go in there to clean, and she always thanks me profusely. When I say profusely... I mean she goes a bit over the top, to be honest, and... I actually don't understand half of what she's saying.

At the time I assumed it was just a fantasy novel... I was so surprised to find out the main character is a real person. I could hardly believe it! She must be someone incredible to have a whole book dedicated to her.

You needn't be concerned about the way I feel. ...Huh? More tool than maid? I disagree! A tool might help you to complete a million tasks to a satisfactory standard, but it feels nothing. I, on the other hand, feel a strong sense of achievement every time I do something for you.

That's because each time I get a thank-you, it makes me feel like my work at least has some meaning, no matter how insignificant it seems.

Last time I went all the way to Liyue, I visited every single shop to compare prices, and then carried everything back myself... I won't be doing that again though.

Media:vo noelle mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Noelle For example... A faded headband under a cabinet.
Media:vo noelle mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Noelle Or a ball hidden in a bush by a kitten.
Media:vo noelle mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Noelle Or a bookmark in a corner of the library, keys dropped at the side of the road, an unsigned letter of confession stuck in the door of the church...
