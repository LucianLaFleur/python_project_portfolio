Appearance[]
Ayaka's hair is tied in a high ponytail by a black armored headdress accented with gold. The chin-length locks of hair framing her face are tied at ear-level with white accessories bordered with gold and fastened with bright pink cords tied in cloverleaf knots.
Ayaka wears a royal blue pleated knee-length skirt embroidered with an assortment of patterns, bearing gold accents and small white flower print with a pair of white shorts with a lace trim at the base underneath, and black geta sandals with ankle-length white socks decorated by pink cloverleaf knots at the back. She has a black breastplate with a golden Kamisato Clan emblem in the center and matching armor platings on the sides of her skirt. Underneath her breastplate is a loose elbow-length shirt with gradients of blue to white. Her cuffs and collar on her top are navy with a variety of gold stripes. She wears black sleeves underneath the loose shirt, sling over her middle fingers, and covering both of her thumbs. On top of her black sleeves are white armored platings lined by gold metal, tied together by red knots. At the back of her outfit is a large royal blue bow, tied together by her Vision and another bright pink cloverleaf knot. The lower half of the ribbons darken in color with gold markings of the same type seen throughout Inazuma.
She also carries around a gold-navy fan that matches her skirt. The fan is seen in one of her idle animations.

Appearance[]
Ayaka's hair is styled into two braids that are looped outward before wrapping around her head. The chin-length locks of hair framing her face have one white flower on each side above her eyebrows and are tied at ear-level with white-trimmed blue accessories that each have one blue butterfly ornament stuck on top. There are white flowers on her braids. Ayaka also wears a hat decorated with two orange flowers on the left side.
Ayaka wears a coat-like light blue open dress with a dark corset over a white petticoat with white sleeves and a faint silver gradient. The open dress's design includes lightly colored lines seen elsewhere in Inazuma and has general gold accents as well as gold accents in the shape of sakura flowers, and the petticoat has the Kamisato Clan crest faintly patterned at the bottom. The dress also has a white collar and a pink bow on the left shoulder. At the back of her dress are gold-tasseled purple ribbons with the Kamisato Clan crest as well as a large blue bow styled to look like a blue butterfly, with her Vision in the center. Ayaka also wears a ring with a small blue butterfly ornament on her right middle finger.

Description[]
At the foot of the Sacred Sakura Tree, a lovely brocade mat lined the ground, an exquisite and beautifully-arranged meal awaiting atop it.
Such was the view that met your eyes when you followed the invitation letter's instructions guiding you to what it called a "picnic."
Moments after, Kamisato Ayaka, the organizer of this picnic, emerged from behind the tree, smiling with a fan in hand and unhurried of gait.
"I've heard that the people of Fontaine enjoy having picnics. I, too, wish to indulge in one such event. Perhaps I'll be able to sample the experience this novel writes of."
That was to be expected: the Yae Publishing House's newly published Fontaine light novel, "The Case Files of Miss Orith," had taken Inazuma by storm of late, after all.
Ayaka had been reading this novel too. From time to time, the two of you would meet and discuss the methods of deduction used within the novel, revealing her deep appreciation for the entire series.
With her hair coiled up and wearing an elegant lady's hat, she looked just like the Fontaine beauty described in the novel.
You found the transformation amazing — though the figure before you was obviously still Ayaka, she had achieved a new sort of elegance merely by changing her apparel.
The "Dame of Fontaine" before you said:
"While reading 'The Case Files of Miss Orith,' I often feel that though there might be similarities between the cultural habits of individual nations..."
"The private lives of each nation's peoples remain more different than not."
"To appraise the lifestyle of a world beyond Inazuma is like peering at the moon's face through a veil of clouds..."
She lowered her head, seemingly vexed.
As the daughter of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, Ayaka is unable to live with the freedom comparable to that of an adventurer — this, you knew quite well.
Just as you were about to say something to console her, she nodded, as if experiencing an epiphany, and said:
"Though such is reality, I am already vastly more fortunate than most."
"With a friend like you, even though I cannot travel, the stories I have heard are no longer limited to Inazuma's borders."
"...I wish that everyone — not just me — could know more about what lies beyond our shores."
So, Ayaka hadn't been distressed on her own account, it seemed.
"Miss Aratani once told me that, beyond the bounds of Inazuma, learning and art flourishes in Sumeru, Mondstadt, Liyue, and Fontaine."
"Yet, we know so very little of them..."
"I intend to propose to my brother and Lady Yae that we bring in more pieces of work from outside Inazuma!"
"Perhaps we can get a glimpse of places and peoples we've never witnessed before by using their literary works as windows..."
Ayaka's bearing far exceeded your expectations — this was, indeed, the "Shirasagi Himegimi" of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan.
"...Before I can propose this to my brother and Lady Yae, however, I must create a specific list of books to be published. As such, I wanted to ask you for some recommendations."
Before you realized it, moved as you were by her words, Ayaka had already begun touching upon the particulars of her plan.
After a moment of deep reflection, you put words to paper and fill the first line of the list in.
"'The Boar Princess'?"
"Indeed," you reply. "It's a beautiful and cruel fairy tale — rather different from other works of its kind. I think people will find it very interesting."
Unfortunately, when Ayaka brought the list of books to Aratani, the editor crossed out "The Boar Princess" without hesitation.
"Ahem. This fairy tale might be a bit too... unique. I fear that people might not be ready for its contents yet..."

Personality
Daughter of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan. Dignified and elegant, as well as wise and strong.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Ayaka is a kind-hearted girl with a pleasant temperament who treats others with politeness and courtesy. She holds the people of Inazuma dear to her heart and often goes out of her way to personally assist in all kinds of matters; being a member of the Yashiro Commission, she feels that she must meet the people's needs. She is a perfectionist with an earnest personality. Her dedication often moves people, and those close to her gave her the honorary title of Shirasagi Himegimi  (Japanese: 白鷺の姫君 Shirasagi no Himegimi, "White Heron Princess"). People in the neighborhood always talk about her with sincere admiration.
Thanks to the influence of Ayaka's excellent upbringing, her heart is as pure as crystallized ice. Just like the splendid colors reflected as the ice crystals spin in the winter air, such is Ayaka's spirit. While the people of Inazuma love her, it is also well known that she has very few friends due to her upbringing — Thoma and Yoimiya are her only known friends until she met the Traveler. She is also busy to the point that she doesn't have much free time, to begin with, so she has trouble mingling with others. When not burdened with her duties, she shows a tender, cute side to her.
But if you want to capture a heart hanging high in the sky, you must have the ability to climb up the clouds. In other words, Ayaka is eager to associate with people capable of achieving great feats — in her eyes, friendships are dictated by fate, the same way she was destined to wield her frost-covered sword.[2]

Ayaka uses the medium female model. She has pale skin, light silver-blue eyes with sky blue pupils, and very light waist-length pale blue hair styled in a hime cut in front. She also has a small mole under her left eye.

Official Introduction
As graceful as the frost drifting in the wind, as elegant as a heron perched in a courtyard
Though Miss Ayaka is the eldest daughter of the Kamisato Clan, she is very attentive to everyone's needs. She will personally take care of the most troublesome matters. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe that there are noble ladies like her!—An ordinary businessman from Hanamizaka
Daughter of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan from Inazuma. Poised and graceful, noble and virtuous.
Working in tandem with her elder brother and the current head of the clan, Kamisato Ayato, the siblings divided among themselves different responsibilities arising from their noble lineage. Ayato is in charge of government affairs while Ayaka watches over the clan's internal and external affairs.

Character Stories
Character Details
A pair of siblings have inherited the Kamisato Clan, one of the three most respected and prestigious clans in Inazuma City.The elder brother, Ayato, is the head of the clan and is in charge of government affairs.While his younger sister, Ayaka, known by all as the Princess, takes care of the clan's internal and external affairs.Ayaka often appears at social occasions and has more interactions with the common folk. As such, she is better known by the people and has gained a higher reputation than her elder brother.This has earned her the elegant title of Shirasagi Himegimi.As is known to all,Ayaka, the daughter of the Kamisato family, is a figure greatly admired by the people for her beauty, dignified demeanor, and noble character.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Across Inazuma, all affairs of state that do not go up to the Raiden Shogun are largely handled by the Triarchal Council.The Council's executive powers are, in turn, divided amongst three groups known as the Tri-Commission: the Yashiro Commission, the Tenryou Commission, and the Kanjou Commission.The three clans that hold power over these Commissions are as follows: Kamisato, Kujou, and Hiiragi. These three great clans are known throughout Inazuma.Kamisato Ayaka is the young lady of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, known far and wide as the Shirasagi Himegimi.When asked the whys and wherefores of such a nickname, many Inazumans have their own explanations..."Lady Ayaka is as graceful and pure as an egret. And just look at her elegance, her clever yet proper speech — why should she not be named a Princess?""Lady Ayaka may be of noble birth, but she is gentle and polite to us. She is kind, loyal, and is willing to help others. She even went against the opinions of others and took in that commoner, Thoma."There are as many opinions concerning this as there are people, but none can say where the "Shirasagi Himegimi" nickname actually originated.Still, Ayaka's popularity amongst the people is quite plain to see.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
As the daughter of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, Ayaka always has to remain alert to the jostling for power between noble families.Being young, yet already famed throughout the land, she has been the inevitable target of provocation on the part of other noble scions who have grown jealous of the Kamisato siblings.The creation and maintenance of a public image may be a formality, but for a house of standing like the Kamisato Clan, even meaningless routine has social significance.Failing to take part in the tangled web of Inazuman political relations risks their position as head of the Yashiro Commission. As such, the two siblings came to an accord.The elder brother, Ayato, preferring not to show his face too often, would busy himself with government affairs, while the act of maintaining the clan's image would be the responsibility of the elegant, socially-adroit younger sister, Ayaka.Through her dignified, demure and polite posture, Ayaka has very much secured a place for herself in the social arena. Whether she is negotiating with potential partners or dealing with difficult nobles, her actions are all well-founded and beyond reproach.The internal clan affairs are also in her care. Indeed, their estates may have descended into chaos already, if not for her.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
One autumn afternoon, Ayaka was on her way home from completing certain minor affairs when she happened to hear an old voice singing from within an old house.Within was an old woman, blind in both eyes, whose stick-thin fingers produced music like flowing water as they plucked at her instrument's strings.Perhaps it was due to her sharp ears, but the old lady heard Ayaka's footsteps and inquired as to who was outside. Not wishing to trouble the old lady, Ayaka replied that she was a nearby resident who had gotten lost and entered this place.As a member of the Yashiro Commission, Ayaka was well-acquainted with the peoples' lives and quickly recognized this solitary old lady as the very same person who busked in the city streets when the weather was good.The tune was outdated, and so was the song. As one who could not see, this lady had long fallen out of step with the times. Even in the nation that pursues eternity, some still endured such hard lives.Out of the goodness of her heart, Ayaka, thusly incognito, spent a long time chatting with the old lady. Taking Ayaka for an ordinary maiden, the old lady spoke of the method of making and playing the koto, and even gave her some tea leaves that she had kept stored up.Compared to the exquisite leaves that the Kamisato Clan had in stock, these rough leaves may as well have been grass, but Ayaka accepted them while profusely thanking her.That day, she thought of her parents many times. Had they been around, would they not have grown this old someday?Returning home, she spoke of her encounter with her brother, and the two siblings shared the rustic tea gifted to her by the old lady.Afterward, Ayaka would come to see that old lady again every few days, each time posing as a person living nearby, and each time bringing with her some daily necessities that were well-loved by the common folk."The sakura trees in the streets have bloomed again," Ayaka said to the old lady with a smile, "and they are as lovely as your music."Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
In people's imagination, the nobility's living expenses are orders of magnitude above the common folk. So for someone as noble as Kamisato Ayaka, surely she too must lead a life of wanton luxury.This statement is only half right, however.Ayaka does ostensibly live in a much more particular manner than the ordinary citizen.The costs of studying flower arrangement and tea ceremony, sampling fine teas, and enjoying exotic flowers daily are also by no means small. However, these are all skills that she must master as a young lady of a noble house — such commitments can hardly be called "wanton."The things that can truly make Ayaka smile are, in fact, ordinary things that even the common folk can enjoy.The making of snacks, fishing for goldfish by the ponds, squirreling herself away to read the latest novels from Yae Publishing House... Each one of these is but a tiny matter.At such times, she is not the adored Shirasagi Himegimi, or Lady Ayaka, mistress of the great Kamisato estates. She is just "Ayaka," an ordinary girl like any other.Here, she sets her dignified externalized persona aside and sets her true, casual self free. Only as "Ayaka" can she lay down her heavy burdens and do the things that ordinary girls can do.When hungry at night, she sneaks past the servants into the kitchen and makes herself some chazuke while humming a little tune. During tea ceremony classes, she might surreptitiously try to use the tea leaves to indulge in some romance-related astrology... The list of her little escapades goes on.Though she has never told anyone this, Ayaka treasures her time as an ordinary girl above all else, for these moments of freedom are things she rarely ever has.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
The tutors who guide Ayaka in her various arts once used to say: whether in tea ceremony, chess, the art of the sword, or all other affairs of elegance, Ayaka is already a master.She is clearly already a noble lady of superb bearing, skilled with both the pen and the sword. To be able to teach such a pupil is a teacher's pride and joy.Still, Ayaka thinks quietly to herself, does she truly have no regrets?The essence of tea is peace and quiet.The heart of the sword is the keenest edge.The soul of chess is the wisdom to grasp the bigger picture.These three she has grasped indeed, and the spirit of true friendship also.And yet, Ayaka is still waiting for a friend to emerge who can walk alongside her on equal footing and stand by her side.That person cannot see her as a member of the Yashiro Commission, or as the Shirasagi Himegimi, nor will their conduct towards her be bound by decorum or status. And if possible, they might also be well-versed in a great many fields of study, and have witnessed all manner of interesting things... and perhaps they might even be able to tell her a story in a pinch.Only such a person might become Ayaka's bosom friend."Surely, this is not too much to ask... But where might I find such a person?"Moriwakamaru Friendship Lv. 4
"Come, come, come,""Let's play Temari!""1, 2, 1, 2, 3,""The Temari goes up the Sacred Sakura Tree.""4, 5, 4, 5, 6,""Woosh, and over Mt. Yougou it flicks!""7, 8, 7, 8, 9,""The Temari returns into these hands of mine.""Yes, into little~ Ayaka's~ hands~!"This was Ayaka's favorite nursery rhyme back in the day.Back then, she gave her favorite Temari the name "Moriwakamaru," and she would dribble the multi-colored Moriwakamaru about while humming this very song.Hearing her song, her parents and brother would be unable to stop themselves from smiling. Indeed, they would often join in the fun, tossing the Temari between them as a family.But that was a long time ago, and Ayaka no longer plays games of Temari.She has become an independent, powerful figure in her own right — and Moriwakamaru, the symbol of her childhood and the bearer of her precious memories, has also been stored away within Ayaka's cabinet.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
Some years ago, the Clan underwent a huge change, and a heavy burden fell upon Ayato's shoulders. At that time, Ayaka was not yet the mature and capable person she is now.She was originally a playful child, one who knew nothing of the clan's duties, and thus lacked the skill and experience needed for dealing with various kinds of people altogether.But seeing her mother on her sickbed and her brother hard at work, Ayaka sensed that she too had to grow up.So she decided to take up her long-disused sword arts and poetry, both staples of nobility. If she could master these two, she could at least pass for a decent lady of the Kamisato Clan, and thus help her brother show up at some festivals, alleviating his burden.Truth be told, Ayaka was not preternaturally gifted and would spend much time being troubled by her inability to memorize poetry, write elegantly, or brandish her sword.Yet she did not waver — a poem she failed to memorize once would be memorized fifty times, a poorly-written word would be written fifty times over, and a sword technique that failed would be swung fifty times more."None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times." — This was something her mother told her.When her mother left this world, Ayaka was no longer "Little Ayaka." She was now Kamisato Ayaka, the young lady of the Kamisato Clan, one of the Shogun's three great clans.Sword art training thus became part of her daily life and has remained so to this day without pause.On one particular day, Ayaka, at last, defeated an opponent in a single strike. In that instant, as she stood in the middle of the dojo, icy flowers condensed all about her. And there, upon the tip of her sword, now hung a Vision, icy and bright."None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times" indeed — and even the gods may thus be moved.

There was one time when I climbed my way into the Kamisato Clan's courtyard, and her Temari just happened to roll over towards the wall. I could tell that she was both surprised and happy to see me. We played together and chatted for quite some time, but I was discovered in the end. And so, our brief friendship came to an end as I was kicked off the premises.GorouAbout Kamisato Ayaka Media:VO_Gorou About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO ZH_Gorou About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO JA_Gorou About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO KO_Gorou About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg The Yashiro Commission operates as part of the Shogunate, but on many issues they tend to side with the people of Inazuma. In fact, the Shirasagi Himegimi has managed to establish an excellent reputation for herself, despite facing pressure from both sides. I suppose she must know how to keep her composure at all times and navigate sensitive situations tactfully... There's much I could learn from her.Kaedehara KazuhaAbout Kamisato Ayaka Media:VO_Kaedehara Kazuha About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO ZH_Kaedehara Kazuha About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO JA_Kaedehara Kazuha About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO KO_Kaedehara Kazuha About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg I'm sure everyone living in Inazuma has heard of the "Shirasagi Himegimi." The lady of the Kamisato Clan is as perfect as a person can be, though our paths have seldom crossed. I wonder what she thinks of the state of Inazuma today?Kamisato AyatoHello Media:VO_Kamisato Ayato Hello.ogg Media:VO ZH_Kamisato Ayato Hello.ogg Media:VO JA_Kamisato Ayato Hello.ogg Media:VO KO_Kamisato Ayato Hello.ogg Greetings. Ayaka has mentioned you on numerous occasions — alas, my schedule has been rather busier than anticipated recently, which belated our first meeting until today. Kamisato Ayato, head of the Kamisato Clan. Delighted to make your acquaintance.When Thunder Strikes Media:VO_Kamisato Ayato When Thunder Strikes.ogg Media:VO ZH_Kamisato Ayato When Thunder Strikes.ogg Media:VO JA_Kamisato Ayato When Thunder Strikes.ogg Media:VO KO_Kamisato Ayato When Thunder Strikes.ogg Ayaka was always scared of thunder as a child — until one day, mother told her that the sound of thunder is the voice of the Almighty Shogun. After that, she would start focusing intensely every time she heard the sound of thunder, as if by concentrating hard enough, she'd be able to hear exactly what Her Excellency was saying.About Kamisato Ayaka Media:VO_Kamisato Ayato About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO ZH_Kamisato Ayato About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO JA_Kamisato Ayato About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO KO_Kamisato Ayato About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg I am confident in Ayaka's abilities. But I want her to be able to hold on to her innocence. She shouldn't have to get personally involved in power struggles, or confront the darker side of life head-on. As her older brother, it's my job to shield her from all of that... Heh, just... between the two of us, of course. Sorry, that got a little more private a little more quickly than I'd intended.About Yoimiya Media:VO_Kamisato Ayato About Yoimiya.ogg Media:VO ZH_Kamisato Ayato About Yoimiya.ogg Media:VO JA_Kamisato Ayato About Yoimiya.ogg Media:VO KO_Kamisato Ayato About Yoimiya.ogg Ah, the fireworks store owner. Yes, a most... spirited young lady. The Kamisato Clan is on rather close terms with her. She is around the same age as Ayaka, and the two get along very well. I trust her direct and outspoken disposition won't lead Ayaka astray.

But in the Kamisato household, there is the sound of music, dance, bickering, and laughter... I have heard that Miss Kamisato is skilled in the game of Go, and have always hoped for an occasion to pay her a visit, but... I also worry that someone of a serious demeanor like myself may not quite fit in there.Raiden EiAbout Kamisato Ayaka Media:VO_Raiden Ei About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO ZH_Raiden Ei About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO JA_Raiden Ei About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO KO_Raiden Ei About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Kamisato...

The one thing she could do better is to speak her mind more. In fact, watch out for this the next time you're talking to her — sometimes, she looks like she's about to say something, but then she holds back. If that happens, keep asking her opinion, see if you can encourage her to open up a little.TravelerAbout Kamisato Ayaka Media:VO_Aether_About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO ZH_Aether_About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO JA_Aether_About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO KO_Aether_About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO_Lumine_About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO ZH_Lumine_About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO JA_Lumine_About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Media:VO KO_Lumine_About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg Paimon: Hmmm...(Traveler): Paimon, you look so serious today.Paimon: That's because Paimon's thinking about serious things.Paimon: Paimon's jealous of people from wealthy and influential families.

In a way, it's a form of prayer and a token of appreciation.Paimon: Paimon gets it now!

I thought to myself, "isn't the Lady Guuji supposed to sit inside the shrine throughout the ritual?" So I watched her the whole time during the ritual, wondering how she'd like to release fireworks. I waited, and I waited, and then Ayaka came over at length to tell me that the Lady Guuji was most pleased. I mean, what? She'd already released the fireworks? Was the person sitting inside the shrine not her, then?MailsSenderMailsSayuHave I... Grown Taller? (Birthday Mail)ThomaA Delicious Meal... (Birthday Mail)A Gathering...

Trivia
She was playable during Closed Beta Test 1 and Closed Beta Test 2 in 2019, but was not released in Genshin Impact until Version 2.0 was released in July 2021.
She was previously on the official website in the Mondstadt section, but was promptly removed. Her old description was: The princess of the Kamisato Clan. She occasionally practices swordsmanship so that she can pass time by slicing every falling snowflake floating around her on a snowy day.
Ayaka is the first character with a unique way of carrying her weapon when it's behind her, usually characters carries their weapon vertically, while Ayaka carries it diagonally. This is likely because the tachi, the type of sword Ayaka wields, is carried diagonally rather than vertically.
Ayaka shares her birthday with Genshin Impact's release date, September 28.
Ayaka is known by these aliases or titles:
Shirasagi Himegimi (白鷺の姫君)
Master of Inazuma Kamisato Art Tachi Jutsu
Secchu Tou (in Zero Hour Invokation)
Kamisato Ayaka is mentioned in the descriptions of the following 2 Furnishings: White Heron Hairpin Yumemiru "Decorum" Kimono Rack
Etymology
Kamisato (Japanese: 神里) means "god's village," while Ayaka (Japanese: 綾華) means "silk flower" (lit. "twill flower"). Kamisato can also be more broadly translated to mean "god's origin," which is similar to the word Genshin (原神) meaning "original god" or "origins of god."
Her constellation, Grus Nivis, is Latin for "snow crane." This could be a reference to the real-life constellation Grus (The Crane), which is alternatively named "The Heron," which would mean that Kamisato Ayaka's banner title "Frostflake Heron" could also be a viable translation for her constellation.
Her title, Shirasagi Himegimi (Japanese: 白鷺の姫君 Shirasagi no Himegimi) means "White Heron Princess." It could likely be inspired by a popular Japanese folk character, Sagi Musume (Japanese: 鷺娘 "Heron Maiden"), a heron (or crane in the original story) who turns into a maiden. There is also a traditional kabuki dance by the same name.
Poetry
In the Japanese voice-over for When It Snows, she recites a tanka-type poem (with the rule of 5-7-5-7-7 syllables):  (Old Japanese: 此雪之、消遺時尓 去来歸、山橘之、實の光毛将見)
The work was composed by Ootomo no Yakamochi from Book 19, Poem 4226 of Man'youshuu.
She also recites Poem 805, Book V in the Japanese voice-over for Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion which composed by Yamanoue no Okura.

So we have become well acquainted with her over the years.Hmm? Public order and fire prevention? We factor these concerns in well in advance during the planning stage. To deny people the chance to see fireworks simply for these reasons would leave them feeling very disappointed.

We were harassed by the Fatui, we lost many of our people, and we received a great deal of criticism. It all aged Father greatly, and severely damaged the Kamisato Clan's standing within the Shogunate. Brother has worked tirelessly to reverse the trend since he assumed leadership, but although our clan's position is now restored and the Yashiro Commission is unified once more, we still rely on Brother to make the decisions on all matters of any importance.

These differences between smiths is what gave rise to the Raiden Gokaden. Swordsmiths capable of forging renowned blades are seen as spiritual personnel with sacred abilities, and as such they should be managed by the Yashiro Commission, which oversees all cultural, artistic, and ceremonial affairs. So naturally, the swordsmith's betrayal is the fault of ineffectual management by the Kamisato Clan.

She was always so dignified and elegant, always smiling, no matter what situation she might be facing. She had so much to deal with in the clan on so many levels, but she took it all in stride — it was like nothing could ever faze her. Everything about her was perfect, and I say that without exaggerating. *sigh* But the moment she passed away, I realized... I couldn't hide behind my mother any longer. I wasn't little Ayaka any more.

Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship2 02a 1.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: My affection for the arts stems from the education I received at home.
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship2 02a 2.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Whenever I try to delve deeper into the meaning behind the words of a poem, I gain a better understanding of the author's state of mind.

Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: ...
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Just reading it makes me sentimental. This must be what people call "the power of art."
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Ah... How rude of me to talk about my own interests all the time.
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Even though I initially wanted to take this opportunity to learn more about you...
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Would you mind if I took up a bit more of your time? Tell me about the things you like.
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: ...Is that alright?
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
 Anything you want to do?
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Hm... Would you like to exchange views on the art of tea-making?
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: In other words... Do you want to try my home-made matcha?
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I have read in a book before that Mondstadt and Liyue each have their own, unique tea cultures.
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: But when it comes to the intricacies of tea-making, the people of Inazuma also have their insights.
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I'd like you to try some authentic Inazuma Matcha and tell me what you think!
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: ...Perhaps your feedback will also deepen my understanding of the tea ceremony.
 I'm pretty sure that someone of your status shouldn't be making tea for me.
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 07a 1.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Please don't say that.
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 07a 2.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: You're the one who's embarked on epic journeys to distant places and achieved many great feats.
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 07a 3.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: The title of "the daughter of the Kamisato Clan" and involvement in the Yashiro Commission pales in comparison to the depths of your experiences.
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 07a 4.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: More importantly... I hope that, between the two of us, we need not be concerned with our identities...
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 07a 5.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I'll just think of you as... my closest confidant.
 Let me make some desserts to go along with the tea.
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 07b 1.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: ...Really?!
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 07b 2.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Ahem... Please excuse my lack of manners. It is because I'm excited.
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 07b 3.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Being able to enjoy tea with my closest confidant — it feels like I'm in a dream...
 (Closest confidant...)
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: ...
Media:vo ayaka mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Can I... Hold your hand?

A Thousand Swings
