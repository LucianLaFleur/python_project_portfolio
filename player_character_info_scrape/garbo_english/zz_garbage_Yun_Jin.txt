Yun Jin's clothing consists of a puffy, long-sleeved, knee-length dark purple dress with a white underskirt. Layered above her underskirt is a dark purple overskirt divided in the middle, split into five sections. Her dress has a white mandarin collar fastened with a red cloverleaf knot, as well as a detailed black corset-like belt studded with gold. Her Geo Vision is pinned on the left side of her cape and a gold geometric symbol of unknown origin on her right. Her legwear consists of translucent lavender tights and a pair of knee-high, lace-up, dark purple boots.
Yun Jin's most prominent accessory is a large dark purple hat inspired by traditional Chinese opera headwear. The underside of the hat has a white base with fluffy pom-poms in various sizes sewn to it, ranging from pink to bright turquoise to white. At the back of the hat are two turquoise, braid-like tassels slightly longer than Yun Jin's hair.

Personality
A renowned Liyue opera singer who is skilled in both playwriting and singing. Her style is one-of-a-kind, exquisite and delicate, much like the person herself.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Yun Jin is a skilled director, playwright and singer who is well renowned throughout Liyue for her plays, enjoying this passion and going to many lengths to ensure that everyone who watches her performances leaves satisfied. While appearing to be refined and graceful in formal occasions, she is also known to be exceptionally friendly in private.[1] She draws inspiration from many sources for her plays; she enjoys a wide variety of special drinks as one of her pastimes and she can write a play about one if she enjoys it.[2]
Despite enjoying her passion, she also enjoys variety; while she gets along with the troupe in theater-related issues, she frequently clashes with them over personal affairs as she feels that they are too traditional. She is particularly fond of rock 'n' roll, visiting Xinyan and watching her performances at least three times a week no matter how busy she is. Xinyan believes that she comes to visit her due to the finer arts being "suffocating".[3] She tries to keep her visits a secret, as her interest in non-traditional music would cause much consternation among her elders.

Appearance

Yun Jin uses the medium female model. She has a fair complexion, rich red eyes with prominent red makeup painted at the corners, and hip-length jet black hair with purple highlights styled in a hime cut.

Official Introduction
The opera star's performance is a genteel display of melodious harmony.
One performance by Yun Jin at our tea house rakes in enough Mora that we won't have to open for a whole month!—Fan Er'ye of Heyu Tea House
She is the director of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe and is also a famous figure in Liyue Harbor's opera scene.
Yun Jin is known for her sweet singing voice and intricate costumes, as well as her animated and dynamic performances. Whether it's a delicate and dignified young lady or a mighty and honorable heroine, she can play any role.
What's even rarer is that this young actress is also a playwright. Other than "The Divine Damsel of Devastation", the Yun-Han Opera Troupe has performed many other new plays in recent years, all of which were written by Yun Jin.
However, what is surprising is that Yun Jin, who has always displayed a dignified and elegant image, has a little hobby that is not known to the public — she likes listening to rock 'n' roll.
If you see Yun Jin at a rock 'n' roll performance in Liyue Harbor, please refrain from telling the whole world about it.
Otherwise, she might get nagged by the elders again.

Character Stories
Character Details
Heyu Tea House has been a popular leisure spot for the people of Liyue.Its business thrives on two things, one of them being its boss Fan Er'ye's business acumen in inviting a top-notch Tea Master who tells the best stories of all.Besides that, there is also the performance of the acclaimed troupe, Yun-Han Opera Troupe. Its director and soul — a famed opera singer named Yun Jin — takes the stage at the tea house from time to time.While one can always get delicious delicacies or good storytelling as long as one knows where to look, Yun Jin's performance does not just await one there.As a result, you can always find fans of Yun Jin trying their luck at Heyu Tea House. While waiting for Yun Jin's performance, they discuss her past performances and how they feel about them.As such, more people frequent the tea house, with nine out of ten of them being Yun Jin's fans.Fan Er'ye couldn't be more satisfied with this state of affairs.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Liyue Opera is one of the traditional arts of Liyue that has been passed down for generations.Liyue Opera enjoys a long history, and it has gone through quite some changes from what it was originally created to be.The good thing is, the Liyue Opera we see now retains the sophisticated-sounding vocals and richly varied melodies of old.Liyue Opera performers usually perform in troupes, and the most acclaimed one of them is the Yun-Han Opera Troupe.For generations, the troupe has been run by the historic house of Yun, and its current director is a prominent figure in Liyue Harbor — the opera singer Yun Jin.Yun Jin made her name at a young age when she stunned her audience with a sweet voice and lively costumes in her debut performance.The more she performs, the better-honed her animated and dynamic style becomes.Whether it's a delicate and dignified young lady or a mighty and honorable heroine, she can play any role.What's even rarer is that this young actress is also a playwright. Other than "The Divine Damsel of Devastation," the Yun-Han Opera Troupe has performed many other new plays in recent years, all of which were written by Yun Jin.With her superb skill, it is no wonder why long-time opera fans often visit Heyu Tea House to ask about Yun Jin's performance schedule when their starving ears demand good opera singing.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
Yun Jin was born in a family of Liyue Opera performers.Her father is a playwright, and her mother used to be a famous opera singer in Liyue Harbor, taking up the mantle from Yun Jin's grandfather.In such an environment, Yun Jin was exposed to Liyue Opera at a very early age, often amusing herself by echoing her mother's singing.A childhood hobby, as many would tend to believe, seems unlikely to be developed into a lifelong career, yet Yun Jin proved to be an exception.She was serious about it and insisted on learning the art.Her parents were delighted to see their daughter's determination and imparted everything they knew about the Liyue Opera to her. As such, Yun Jin started learning the opera early.However, Liyue Opera is a complex art that takes years of perfection to master.So even for a child as gifted as Yun Jin, what awaited her was sweat and tears. While ordinary children might shy away from the pain of hamstring stretches and the tedium of memorizing lyrics, little Yun Jin hung tough and became quite accomplished.By the time she finished all the subjects in Liyue Opera, veterans of Yun-Han Opera Troupe who watched her grow up couldn't help but exclaim,"Yet another rising opera star is about to shine upon Liyue Harbor!"Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Many veterans of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe first joined the troupe when Yun Jin's grandfather was in charge.They have remained committed since Yun Jin took the troupe over.Their love for the art of Liyue Opera is so deep — perhaps even to an excessive degree — that they frown upon any other forms of music performance, including rock 'n' roll.Yun Jin, however, thinks otherwise. She finds that rock 'n' roll vibrates with vigor and even became friends with the rock 'n' roll musician Xinyan.Elders of the troupe are glad to follow Yun Jin's lead during rehearsals, but when it comes to daily life, they treat her like their little granddaughter."Sweetie, listen to us. No spicy food, it hurts your voice. Meat is fine, but refrain from eating too much, or you will put on weight.""If you really can't help yourself, have more shrimp. Stay away from the... roll 'n' roll thing. All they know is yelling."These caring elders will nag Yun Jin about attending rock 'n' roll performance for hours on end.Faced with the impossible mission of persuading stubborn granddads and grannies, Yun Jin has to be creative.While it's not an option to go to Xinyan's performance, it's perfectly acceptable to visit Fan Er'ye's adopted daughter Xingyan and discuss Liyue Opera with her.The elders are not fond of the rock star Xinyan, but they have taken a shine to Xingyan the adopted daughter of Fan Er'ye."I've heard that Xingyan can cook and do embroidery. She must be a polite and accomplished young lady. Yun Jin may be able to pick up a thing or two from hanging out with her. How capital!"Yun Jin has long got Fan Er'ye to agree on the details concerning the made-up Xingyan, so don't worry. No one's gonna call her out on this!Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Yun Jin goes by many names. To some, she is Director Yun, and to others, Sir Yun.They call her Director Yun for her leadership of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe. Though there are managers to help with everyday work, Yun Jin is the one who makes the big decisions. She thus earned the name of Director Yun from people in business circles.As for Sir Yun, that is another story.When Yun Jin's grandfather was in charge of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe, long-time fans respectfully addressed him as Sir Yun. After Yun Jin took charge later, these fans frequented her performances as well.There was once after a show when an impressed fan half-joked with others, "the Sir Yun we have now sings rather well too."A voice from the crowd immediately countered by saying: "How can you address a young girl as Sir?"Upon hearing this, Yun Jin curved her lips."Those who were born early, learn early. They are naturally better-informed than others. It's every bit right for them to be referred to as Sirs.""But one doesn't have to be old to be knowledgeable. Besides, why can't a girl be knowledgeable?""You are quick in mind and speech, and are thus qualified to be called Sir. I have answered your eminent question — that also makes me a Sir."Her remarks impressed the fans present, who shared this story to many. In the end, everyone followed the trend and started to call her Sir Yun whether they had or had not met her in person.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Many traditional Liyue Operas revolve around the theme of the adepti and Rex Lapis himself.A prime example would be "The Divine Damsel of Devastation." People are full of wonderful fantasies about the adepti and would like to see the representation of their joy and anger on stage. Thus, stories portraying them make up the majority of the repertoire of Liyue Opera.When Yun Jin was young, she would find these stories engaging, but having exhausted every adeptal legend in her performing career, her take on theming gradually changed.Why not experiment with other themes? For instance... stories of our own, perhaps?Stories that tell of our earthly joys and sorrows, songs that sing of the hatreds and passions of humanity.Maybe these stories of mere mortals may not make it as classics of Liyue Opera, but there will always be some people who remember them.In love our thoughts linger, in rage our hearts burn, and in obsession, our minds go astray. These emotions, good or bad, lift the veil that covers our feelings and souls.Yun Jin is no adeptus. She can never put herself in the shoes of the adepti, yet she is endowed with the most accurate and sensitive grasp of human emotions."So, let me sing of human stories. May my brush be the brush of all hearts and my voice the voice of all souls."This is the unspoken wish that Yun Jin has so far only kept to herself.Longevity Lock Friendship Lv. 4
Her ancestors used to work as weaponsmiths instead of opera performers.Later, someone in the family who was tired of weapon forging grew an interest in the performing arts. By the time it came to Yun Jin's generation, few of the Yuns still practiced the art of forging.Many forged things have been passed down, though. The lock-shaped copper pendant that Yun Jin carries with her is one such item.In her childhood, she often practiced dancing for a whole day under the scorching heat of the sun. Sometimes, she would even faint from the exhaustion.Her parents' hearts ached for her, but they knew well that she had to go through such things to lay a solid foundation.So instead of stopping her, they gave Yun Jin the lock in the hopes that it would keep fortune and health within her.Since then, the lock has never left Yun Jin's side. Before every performance, it is a routine for Yun Jin to reminisce about those days of bittersweet training by cleaning the lock with great care.It feels as if she was caressing the devoted heart of the little Yun Jin who was learning the opera.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
Shortly after Yun Jin's debut, Yun Jin quickly got the hang of stage performance through dozens of shows and her great intelligence.At the time, her appearance meant a whole night of applause for a performance. However, the more she played, the more she felt at a loss — these were not the operas she wanted to perform.In every opera, the pitch and tempo would invariably go either up or down to indicate drama or doldrum.As time passed by, the visage of the various characters seemed to blend and blur.The music would come on, followed by a neat dance, and then her sweet voice. The girl in "The Divine Damsel of Devastation" seemed no different from the fisherman's daughter in "String of Pearls."While the audience did not object, Yun Jin was not satisfied. "Is skillful singing and dancing all it takes to tell a moving tale?"What broke her bottleneck was an opera named "Snow Treading."It was a monodrama about a strenuous walk in the snow. It happened to be a snowy day when Yun Jin first performed the opera.Having gone astray in the snow, the character felt lost and lamented her helplessness. Somehow, the snow in the story seemed to fall into reality. Yun Jin, who had also found herself adrift, felt as if she had become her character.That was what she had been looking for, the feeling of leaving herself behind and walking in the shoes of the many characters she played.To breathe, to live, and to smile just like them.That was the opera she had wanted to sing, the story she had wanted to tell — one about true emotions, a world built on tens of thousands of individuals who live lives of their own.Yun Jin could no longer recall how she returned backstage after the epiphany. All she knew was that when she finally had time to take off her costume, she found a Vision in her sleeve.

About Yun Jin: SchoolingAbout Yun Jin: SchoolingMedia:VO_Yun Jin About Yun Jin - Schooling.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yun_Jin_About_Yun_Jin_-_Schooling.ogg My schooling started very early. In fact, my earliest memories are of my father teaching me to read. Despite my best efforts, my ability is not half of his. Enough to write operas, but compared to his level of erudition, I still have much to strive for.
About Yun Jin: Opera TrainingAbout Yun Jin: Opera TrainingMedia:VO_Yun Jin About Yun Jin - Opera Training.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yun_Jin_About_Yun_Jin_-_Opera_Training.ogg In her youth, my mother was a famous opera singer in Liyue Harbor, and I learned all the operas I know from her. But, you could never imagine how strict she was with me as a teacher. Thinking back on it now, I... *sigh* No, no, no, I'd rather not think about it at all.

I think you'd be a perfect match for the part. How about it? Would you like to join our troupe? We can even enjoy some tea together between acts.

You like rock 'n' roll? Oh, that's great! I'll be sure to bring you along the next time I go out to see a show. And when I get back, I can just tell the senior troupe members that I went out to visit you... Hehe, that way, they won't have any reason to get on my case about going out.

I've already tried all the sophisticated-sounding drinks that previous generations came up with — you know, like Pine Nectar Tea and Snow Blossom Tea. I'm beginning to worry that I'll run out of new drinks to try soon. You don't happen to have any recommendations, do you?

Needless to say, they never approve of me going to see Xinyan's shows. "It's for your own good," they say. Hmph, all it's really about is their inability to accept anything new. Whatever, those old fogies can't tell me what to do. I'm going to keep rocking out at Xinyan's gigs, every week, and that's that.

Sometimes I find that I only know the hows but not the whys behind what we do. But when speaking with Zhongli, it is abundantly evident that he knows the origins behind almost everything. Who wouldn't be delighted to have such a connoisseur in their audience?

Life is full of strange twists sometimes! My only hope is that she can find true friendship and never be lonely again.

I suppose the fact that I can both write and sing my own material has contributed to my rising popularity in Liyue Harbor.

There's no doubt that an opera star in full attire looks spectacular, but achieving this look is frightfully exhausting. So I perform without hair and makeup whenever I have the option — and if I must perform in full dress, I try to select a costume that isn't too heavy. Fortunately, the good folks at Heyu Tea House are quite lenient with us. Otherwise, we'd be working ourselves to early graves.

It wasn't long before I developed a captious attitude... If I didn't like the script, or if the stage was too small, or if I thought there weren't enough people in the audience, I would refuse to perform. Looking back now, it was all terribly arrogant of me... my goodness. I shall never let myself become so vain again.

Before taking it over, I only knew two things: how to write opera and how to perform it on stage. I never gave any thought to how to run a troupe. Becoming the troupe's director gave me a crash course in this unfamiliar area and I've experienced all the highs and lows of working with people along the way... Only now do I understand that life mirrors opera, just as opera reflects life.

A prime example would be "The Divine Damsel of Devastation," which we have been performing recently. Long-time opera fans adore this sort of material, but in this age of humanity, I would rather like to tell stories about ordinary people. Yes, how grand it would be to sing about the hopes and dreams of ordinary people for all to hear. I've never shared these thoughts with anyone before... Thank you for listening so patiently. I'm fortunate to have a close friend like you.

Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship1 03a 1.ogg Yun Jin: Yes. Why, that's a fundamental part of anyone's routine in my profession.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship1 03a 2.ogg Yun Jin: If you skip a day, only you will know. But if you skip three days, the whole audience will know. A master never forgets the fundamentals of practicing.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship1 03a 3.ogg Yun Jin: *sigh* Alright, I can see it written on your face already, "That sounds exhausting"... As a matter of fact, I don't feel that way at all, quite the opposite, really.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship1 03a 4.ogg Yun Jin: To fully deliver the elegance of Liyue opera to the audience, we must strive for excellence, properly performing every subtlety in the story.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship1 03a 5.ogg Yun Jin: To be completely honest, I find great enjoyment in my hours of practice.
 Shall I accompany you while you rehearse?
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship1 03b 1.ogg Yun Jin: Haha, how kind. I do appreciate your courtesy.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship1 03b 2.ogg Yun Jin: However, in my practice routine, I tend to go over my whole repertoire, both singing and reciting... I may suddenly be acting dreadfully mournful one moment, and then practicing a hysterical laugh the next... I fear such a kaleidoscope of outright emotion may scare you.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship1 03b 3.ogg Yun Jin: I would much prefer to offer you a complete and fully prepared opera instead.
 I understand.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Yun Jin: Great. Thank you for your kind understanding.

 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Yun Jin: Yes, that would be perfect. I've been meaning to ask for your guidance on many things.
 You're so modest, Yun Jin.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship2 02a 1.ogg Yun Jin: It's just that you've traveled extensively... you have much experience for me to draw upon.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship2 02a 2.ogg Yun Jin: I must respect you if I wish to gain from your experience.
 You're so formal sometimes, Yun Jin.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship2 02b 1.ogg Yun Jin: Haha, is this humor of yours also something that you've acquired throughout your travels?
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship2 02b 2.ogg Yun Jin: Then I won't beat around the bush.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Yun Jin: Ahem, to be completely honest... There are times I have considered giving up the opera and taking time to travel around faraway nations. But things are always busy in the troupe and I've just never found the right opportunity.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Yun Jin: After traveling to so many places, I'm sure that you've learned many different customs. Would you mind sharing some with me?
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Yun Jin: For example, the swordplay of the Knights in Mondstadt, what's that like? Does it differ from that of the martial artists we see in Liyue?
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Yun Jin: I've also heard that the swords produced in Inazuma can cut through nearly anything... How do they forge such sharp swords?
 The knights of Mondstadt are masters of Favonius Bladework.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship2 07a.ogg Yun Jin: A fighting style that flows like the wind? I wonder, are they capable of even manipulating the wind in combat?
 The smithies in Inazuma forge their blades from Jade Steel...
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship2 07b.ogg Yun Jin: Oh, that must be a very special material, then... It's no wonder that the people of Inazuma are reputedly confident in their craftsmanship.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Yun Jin: I want to hear all that you have to say! It truly is fascinating.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Yun Jin: I'll be sure to prepare some more questions for the next time we talk.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Yun Jin: Of course, I'll be sure to make our conversations worth your time as well. I will prepare an appropriate gift for you as thanks for answering my questions.

 Is there anything you'd like to do?
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Yun Jin: Yes, now that you mention it... there is one thing I have been meaning to do.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Yun Jin: When I was a child, my father often told me legends of the adepti. I remember that one legend in particular made mention of an adeptus's abode in Jueyun Karst.
 An adeptus's abode?
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Yun Jin: Yes, that's right. The legend had it that adepti could drift upon beams of light, ride lightning, and leap into the sky to ascend to their abode.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Yun Jin: "From their lofty dwelling, they gaze to and fro. Drifting over land and sea, they know not the world below."
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Yun Jin: My father would have a mesmerized look on his face whenever we got to that part of the story.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Yun Jin: But though the story has been passed down all these years, no one has yet to ever see such an abode...
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Yun Jin: It has always been my dream to go and see such a place one day.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Yun Jin: I would even like to perform an opera there, letting adepti and people alike hear my voice echoing through the lands.
 I think I know of a place like the one you've described.
 We could just go to Qingyun Peak...
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Yun Jin: No... Really?
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Yun Jin: Ahem... I mean... I know that your words are sincere, it's just that you answered so quickly, and I haven't even decided what opera to perform or what costume to prepare...
 Take your time to think it over.
 I'll take you there once you've made up your mind.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Yun Jin: Thank you very much! That's most kind of you.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Yun Jin: ...
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship3 13.ogg Yun Jin: Alright, I have some ideas. I think for the performance, I will sing a selection about you and your dealings with the adepti...
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship3 14.ogg Yun Jin: As for the costume, I was hoping you could give me some creative input.
 You have a deal!
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo friendship3 16.ogg Yun Jin: Alright, it's settled. I'll start practicing today... Actually, why not start right away — no time like the present! I must make sure this performance turns out perfect.
(Between 6:00 and 19:00)
 Good morning, Yun Jin.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo morning 01.ogg Yun Jin: Good morning. Will you be departing for adventures in a distant land today?
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo morning 02.ogg Yun Jin: Let's just hope that the weather will hold up with no rain or storms, and that you can go speedily about your way.
(Between 19:00 and 6:00)
 Good night, Yun Jin.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo night 01.ogg Yun Jin: Yes, good night, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! It is good to turn in early from time to time.
Media:vo yunjin mimitomo night 02.ogg Yun Jin: The night markets are always worth a visit though, perhaps we can save that for tomorrow.

Glittering Street

Media:vo mimitomo md yunjin store 01.ogg Yun Jin: I always love to take a stroll around the night market after a performance.
Media:vo mimitomo md yunjin store 02.ogg Yun Jin: This street has a striking resemblance to those back in Liyue. It really feels just like being there.
Media:vo mimitomo md yunjin store 03.ogg Yun Jin: Let's take a stroll around here tonight, then. What do you say?

Feiyun Study Room

Media:vo mimitomo md yunjin study 01.ogg Yun Jin: Hmm, would you look at that... the name of this room is the "Feiyun Study Room."
Media:vo mimitomo md yunjin study 02.ogg Yun Jin: Its name contains the word "yun," just like my own name... It looks like I have a special connection with this room.
Media:vo mimitomo md yunjin study 03.ogg Yun Jin: Haha, I'm kidding, of course. It is most definitely to my liking, though. Furnished with all the supplies one could possibly hope for in a study. I am truly grateful.
