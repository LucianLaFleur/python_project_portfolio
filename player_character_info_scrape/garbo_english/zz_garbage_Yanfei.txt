Personality
A well-known legal adviser active in Liyue Harbor. A brilliant young lady in whose veins runs the blood of an illuminated beast.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Yanfei enjoys appraisal, reading and is very knowledgeable on many topics — most notably the law, due to her career as a legal advisor. With a strong sense of justice, Yanfei does not mind traveling to help her clients should they have trouble in different parts of Liyue. She claims to have extensive knowledge of the laws of the other nations in Teyvat — though, she notes Fontaine's law to be the most difficult. She is well known by the people of Liyue for her knowledge and is considered the premier legal advisor of Liyue, a title that garners her many a client across the nation. Even Ningguang, the Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing, states that Yanfei's memorization of the law allows her to quickly close loopholes in existing laws faster than she would have been able to herself.[2] When resolving disputes, Yanfei always gets all legal evidence beforehand to make a compelling and convincing argument. Although she can handle any case, she dislikes having to deal with civil suits. As many in Liyue do, Yanfei places a high value on the importance of contracts, though she is noted to place a higher value on them more than the average person due to the nature of her job.
Despite having the blood of an adeptus in her veins, Yanfei is not particularly concerned about her adeptal heritage and is one of the few who did not sign a contract with Rex Lapis due to being born in an era of peace. It is not through any adepti powers or abilities that she may have that she endeavors to make life in Liyue better, but through her profession. She is very active and often talks a lot, a stark contrast to her adeptus father, whom Madame Ping states to be more solemn. She spends her time much like an average human does, and unlike most adepti, Yanfei doesn't consider herself above mortals in any way.
Despite her playful nature, Yanfei takes her job seriously and practically, ensuring she and all involved parties of a case are well accounted for. She is also willing to do pro bono work as long as she isn't required to be deeply involved. Yanfei dreams of a day where people live honest and happy lives, and there is no longer a need for legal advisors. Should such a day ever come, Yanfei's backup plan is to become a rapper.
Yanfei enjoys tofu because of its versatility and availability. She dislikes cold food and she rarely eats them since her father told her that food was best served hot.

Appearance
See also: Golden Rule
Yanfei uses the medium female model. She has a pale complexion, bright teal-green eyes with ovoid pupils, and salmon-colored hair that goes past her shoulders and fades to a pale peach at the tips. The hair around the sides of her head is chopped short at ear length in a fringe, revealing a pair of cream colored antlers[3] as a result of her xiezhi[4] heritage. In addition to this, the sides of her chest, ankles, and the backs of her hands have white diamond-shaped markings that resemble scales.

Official Introduction
Do not seek to emulate the past, for there is no law that can suffice for all time.
Law is the cornerstone of Liyue's prosperity. This cornerstone needs to be continuously polished to pursue perfection. I have had many dealings with Yanfei in legal affairs, and I must give her credit for helping me uncover quite a number of flaws in our system of laws.—Ningguang
Yanfei is Liyue Harbor's top legal adviser. They say that she has memorized tens of thousands of legal codices and can skillfully apply the law in various situations. One can rest assured that she will aptly handle any legal case brought to her.
But this is not to say that Yanfei adheres blindly to the legal codices. Rather, she employs a degree of flexibility within the limits of the law and reason.
This half-illuminated beast protects the order of Liyue in her unique, effective manner.
All of Liyue's residents have heard of the famed Yanfei, no matter who you ask. Of course, as is the ancient rule in the City of Contracts, one seeking legal consultation or services from Yanfei must prepare a rather hefty sum as payment.

Character Stories
Character Details
Liyue is a port that prizes contracts and trade, and it is a place where wealth accumulates.Merchants from various nations are active here, which has contributed to Liyue's abundance, but has also brought up many disagreements. The Tianquan, Ningguang, has written a very comprehensive compendium of laws to deal with this, but not everyone has the patience to study them.Thus was born the role of the legal adviser in Liyue society. Highly familiar with Liyue's laws, they help those in need to navigate any contradictions, earning recompense for their efforts.Yanfei is the premier legal adviser in Liyue Harbor.She is always able to obtain the most benefits for her clients, insofar as the law will allow. Some even call her "the law that walks."But in truth, what Yanfei — one of the few half-illuminated-beasts who have yet to sign a contract with Rex Lapis — really wants to do is live a free and happy life.As for the copy of "The General Law of Liyue" that she carries around on her person, Yanfei has this to say:"If you don't wish to be bound by the rules, you have to first understand them all."Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
As the most sought-after legal adviser in Liyue Harbor, Yanfei's rates are also top-of-the-line.Even so, she never lacks for people coming to seek appointments. After all, merchants are not stingy about mediation fees, but are very picky indeed about the mediator."Money is no object — we must have Yanfei come and settle this matter for us."Many rate Yanfei in this fashion, not only for her quick-thinking or her masterful oratory, but also because she very greatly emphasizes the cornerstone of the law — "fairness."Her mediations often end in win-win situations, and even merchants with daggers drawn will temporarily set their prejudices aside.Though she is unbound by a contract, Yanfei has made her own contribution to the peace and prosperity of Liyue.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
As a legal adviser, Yanfei does have her fair share of weaknesses. An example is the mediation of civil disputes that involve emotions and relationships.Divorces, inheritances, custody disputes, senior care, severances... The list continues.It is said that upright officials are hapless in household affairs, and so it also is with Yanfei, who grew up surrounded by love — these matters fall right into her blind corner.Sometimes, she will find that both sides have reason on their side, and other times she will find them to both be unreasonable. Child custody disputes are the absolute worst, as no matter how she settles them, the settlement will have a great psychological impact on the innocent children. Even if Yanfei chooses to soldier on, she will only tire herself out."Hopefully, everyone can meet the right person and be spared this particular grief."Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
As a result of her greatly tolerant nature, Yanfei has a wide variety of personal relationships throughout Liyue.There is no need to worry about rubbing a sore spot, and you'll be able to get along with her whether you're an avid conversationalist or not.Of course, this is true as long as you don't attempt to debate with her or start a conversation about the legal profession... Yanfei in work mode is a completely different beast to deal with.Additionally, Yanfei has cultivated the habit of being overly rigorous from her long years of studying the law. When chatting, Yanfei will vigorously eliminate any ambiguity or loopholes present in the discourse and can seem like a bit of a chatterbox. When she realizes this, Yanfei is wont to knock herself on the head with a book in irritation.However, so long as she constantly bathes in a sea of legal literature, this habit will probably be quite hard to break.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
When investigating the law, Yanfei's habit is to look past the cold letters of the law to perceive their point of origin.As such, she is also something of a master of "reading comprehension" in her relationships.Once, the Traveler met Yanfei by chance and said, "Huh. Didn't expect to see you here."This should have been a line that one might hear just about anywhere, but it wound up holding a completely different meaning for Yanfei."Didn't expect to meet you here" implied that the Traveler had at least thought about a scenario in which they would meet. Then why the use of "didn't expect"? One could only postulate that the Traveler had some expectation of where she might appear, and that her current location was not such a place. But whence came the expectation? Could it be that the Traveler had always been paying attention to her in secret?"Does this mean that the Traveler...?"Yanfei tossed and turned in bed that night, unable to sleep.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Yanfei's most prized possession is the steelyard balance that her father gave her.It is said that this balance was a treasure given by Rex Lapis that can be used to measure the value of all things. For convenience, Yanfei tends to use Mora to balance the scales, which is to say that she uses Mora to evaluate objects.The prices of many objects have slowly changed over the years, but weighing an object with this balance only gives its value at the time Mora was created, leaving the rest to Yanfei to exercise her own wisdom and judgment.Across the measurements of countless objects, Yanfei is able to see the changes in Liyue. Some objects that were once common have become vanishingly rare, and some exotic objects of the past have been rendered pedestrian today.This steelyard balance reminds her that many things cannot be valued by the standards of the world.Yanfei once tried to weigh the value of a Vision, but no matter how much Mora she added, the scales would not be balanced.In frustration, she placed on the scale the box at her waist, which contained her heavy, handwritten legal notations. Only then did the weights at last even out.Codex Finalem Friendship Lv. 4
This is the most special of the many legal treatises that Yanfei collects.As opposed to the codices that grow heavier and more complicated with time, this book is unbelievably light and thin.After opening it and getting past the prologue, one will find naught but the most basic few principles of the law inscribed.As Yanfei sees it, this is the final form of the law. In the far future, the law will have entered into the people's hearts. All people will be amiable, modest, and live happily in this world. The halls of judgment will lie empty and the mountains of legalese shall be caked in years of dust.Though this may sound like something very far off, for someone like Yanfei, in whom flows the blood of an illuminated beast, living till that day is hardly a great accomplishment."Hmm, but if I think about it more deeply, I'd be out of a job then, wouldn't I?"After encountering one of Xinyan's performances by chance, Yanfei was quite taken by this new wave of performance art.That said, learning an instrument from scratch proved to be a bit difficult, so after consulting a great many resources, Yanfei came to what she considered to be a decent backup plan.If such a day were to arrive, she would just become a rapper.For someone who can recite tens of thousands of words' worth of Liyue law from front to back within an hour, speed at least should be no challenge.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
Yanfei's father is an illuminated beast, while her mother is an ordinary mortal merchant. Born into peaceful times, Yanfei did not sign a contract with Rex Lapis, but instead has one with her parents to "live happily."As Liyue's leading legal exegete, she is no stranger to exploiting some existing loopholes in the law — at times for herself, and sometimes for others.It has been made clear often enough that Yanfei is not a stickler for the rules and has no wish to be shackled by strictures.Still, she contributes to the betterment of Liyue as she seeks her own pleasure, and will not use these loopholes for ill.When making amendments to legal loopholes each year, Ningguang the Tianquan will often study Yanfei's doings, as if she were Liyue's unofficial legal troubleshooter.In a sense, one could argue that Yanfei makes the laws better at the lowest possible price... This principle is also the reason why she has never been convicted of exploiting any such loopholes.Yanfei believes in "no structure without laws," and what she wishes for is to "live as one pleases without overstepping."Everyone in Liyue, adeptus or mortal, protects it in their own way.That is why Yanfei possesses a Vision, one that is of equal weight to her principles.

Trivia
Yanfei (Chinese: 烟绯 Yānfēi) is Chinese for "smoky scarlet."
Her constellation, Bestia Iustitia, is Latin for "Beast (of) Justice," referring to her illuminated beast bloodline.
Yanfei's burst "Wrath of the Flame", elaborated upon in her voice-overs, is a pun that was lost in translation. The original is "Fire-eating punishment" (Chinese: 食炎之罚 shí yán zhī fá), which is by lore based on Rex Lapis's "Rock-eating punishment" (Chinese: 食岩之罚 shí yán zhī fá). Both of these are homophones and are ultimately a pun on the phrase "Punishment for breaking a promise" (Chinese: 食言之罚 shí yán zhī fá).
Her father is an adeptus who campaigned with Rex Lapis in the past. Like Ganyu, this makes Yanfei a half-adeptus.
Yanfei's father is likely a xiezhi, an East Asian mythological creature described as a "righteous beast" and a symbol of justice and law.
Her hat resembles a "xiezhi hat" (Chinese: 獬豸冠 xièzhì guān), a hat worn by legal officers in ancient China.[5]
The music track featured in her Collected Miscellany video is titled "Marching of Xiezhi".[6]
She is the second 4 star character to get a Collected Miscellany video, the first being Rosaria.
Yanfei shares her English voice actor, Lizzie Freeman, with Teucer.
Yanfei is known by these titles and or aliases:
Legal advisor lady (by Arataki Itto)
My savior (by Arataki Itto)
Liyue's top legal advisor (by Yelan)
Contestant with Super OP Gear (during the Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp event)

You have to be kind, courteous, and patient with your clients, even though half the time they are completely incapable of participating in a constructive discussion. *sigh* I know I advertise myself as being fully versed in every area of the law, but honestly, if it were up to me, I'd rather everyone could just get along, so we wouldn't have so many of these cases.

Someone like me, for example, whose expertise goes beyond just the law of Liyue... Well, actually, having said that, Fontaine's law is notoriously complicated... Though, with my level of intelligence, getting acquainted with it should be no problem! Anyway... My point is, you can always rely on me!
About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yanfei About the Vision.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yanfei_About_the_Vision.ogg Visions appear in response to strong desire, so as someone with ideals, it's only natural that I should have received one. Because, above all, I wish for all people to live honest lives and abide by the law. But some people will always insist on playing by their own rules and causing havoc for everyone else... Hah, those people can expect to be prosecuted so hard, they won't know what hit them!
Something to Share: Balance Friendship Lv. 4Something to Share: Balance Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yanfei Something to Share - Balance.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yanfei_Something_to_Share_-_Balance.ogg This steelyard balance was a gift from my father. It weighs objects to determine their value. I usually use Mora for the weight, but it can only give the original price. For example, a thousand years ago, Liyue was covered in Glaze Lilies, and they weren't worth anything in monetary terms. Then, when they suddenly declined in number, the price shot up in response, but the value shown by this steelyard wasn't updated. It still shows them as their original value... in other words, dirt cheap.So, most of the time, this isn't a very useful tool for work purposes... Hmm? You want to try weighing something? How about... We could weigh your little friend here, will that do?

The Lord of Geo is the God of Contracts, and contracts, too, can be seen as a way of restraining people. Haha, ergo, Liyue Harbor has been the City of Contracts since time immemorial.
Interesting ThingsInteresting ThingsMedia:VO_Yanfei Interesting Things.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yanfei_Interesting_Things.ogg The Historia Naturalis Liyue has an entry about a waterborne plant called the Horsetail. It claims that "The Horsetail is a medicinal herb that stands alone on the banks of Dihua Marsh. Its color is that of the clouds at sunset." Apparently, if you grind it into a powder and mix it into your ink, it makes your writing water-resistant. But it's a shame, I've been to Dihua Marsh at least a hundred times, and each time I end up with baskets and baskets of the common purple variety, but not a single one of the kind that the book describes.

Most of the time, she's buried in an endless pile of paperwork — the only exception being her nap at noon. Don't get me wrong, I have to put in some hours at work, too. But I'm happy with the job I've chosen, and it's certainly a lot less taxing than hers.

Their approach to business is meticulous and thorough, and every business meeting I've had with them has always been attended by the head of the house himself. Last time, though, I happened to meet their youngest, Xingqiu. To my complete surprise, the lad had no trouble whatsoever keeping up with my train of thought. He was very eloquent, too, and had excellent manners. Mm, definitely not a simpleton.

They think she's gone a little non compos mentis after being in the funeral business so long... What are these people talking about? The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor provides a legitimate and necessary service, which is the cornerstone of any successful enterprise. Work is just work — there are no good and bad jobs, or lucky and unlucky jobs, just jobs that need doing.If I had one gripe, it would be that the director rarely comes to me for legal advice, hmph...

He's a total savant, though he never flaunts it. I could tell just by looking at him. People like him rarely shy away from taking on complex problems alone, so in my estimation he's certainly not a potential client.And yet, somehow, I can't help but think I know him from somewhere, it's hard to describe the feeling... I asked my father about it, and he just said something to the effect of he didn't know either, though he seemed a little evasive. It was so strange... Anyway, makes me wonder if my father is hiding something from me. Hmph, alright then — if he won't tell me what's going on, I'll just have to find out for myself...
About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Yanfei About Ningguang.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Yanfei_About_Ningguang.ogg You must have heard of the Tianquan, Ningguang? She's the highest authority where the law is concerned, and often makes amendments to the legal codices. Every round of additions, retractions, and revisions generates mountains of material. Why, the latest edition of the legal codices contained three new laws, 121 revised legal annotations, and an array of new legal precedents. Archons know how long it's going to take me to commit them to memory...Hmph... still, she's a businesswoman at heart, I'm not about to let her beat me when it comes to the law. Once I've finished memorizing these, I need to step up my productivity...

Knowing Keqing's attitude toward work and ruthless efficiency, I'd end up losing a lot of work. Although... No, surely it wouldn't come to that. She's a stickler for doing things the right way — no doubt she'd offend people... but if she had someone like me as her legal assistant... No way! Why should an eminent legal expert such as myself be relegated to the role of assistant!? If she needs legal counsel, she can come and find me.

She's very familiar with the Knights of Favonius' legislation, but has never been one to be bound by convention. She uses cunning logic to deal with problems flexibly... Perhaps the reason we get along so easily is that I'm a similar type myself. Still, I'll never acquire that carefree spirit of hers. We are in very different professions, after all.

Yes, in the future, I need to make absolutely sure I don't get on the wrong side of her.

I remember her, she's the Inazuman girl that came to Liyue as an exchange student to specialize in law. When she was doing her coursework, she used to meet with me to discuss some cases, and after we were done, she'd always bow and thank me, which would always make me a little embarrassed. I always felt like she was going to make an excellent lawyer in the future. Thinking about it, Inazuma went into lockdown right around the time she would have graduated. I wonder how she's been doing since she went back...

If he'd wanted me to sign a different contract, say... one about working myself into the ground, or stepping on others to achieve success... I would've ran away by now!

The other party might win compensation way in excess of the damages, or pay damages far exceeding the costs... Such is the price of violating a contract. Some people say I'm pretty terrifying, others try to avoid me altogether, but I don't need to explain myself to anyone. Since the very beginning, the welfare of Liyue has been my primary concern!Think about it — the origin of disputes can be traced back to the violation of contracts. People are a lot less likely to violate contracts when they see the fallout. Making sure that people realize the importance of contracts is a crucial part of my work!

I have a successful career, clothes on my back, and the freedom to go wherever I please. I've also got quite a way with words — nobody can beat me in a debate. And yet, there is no law or standard that can define a happy life.For me... interesting people and engaging affairs, knowing where to go and which path to choose... these are all enough to bring me happiness. And on that note, you too are a source of happiness for me.In any case, whatever the life you live, the most important thing is to respect and understand the law.

 How are things?
 My favorite client!

Dialogue

Media:vo yanfei mimitomo hello 01.ogg Yanfei: If it isn't my favorite client, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! It's been a while, how are things?
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo hello 02.ogg Yanfei: ...Hmm, by the looks of it, nowhere near dire enough for you to be needing my services. *sigh* A shame, no Mora to be made here...
 How do you like it here?
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Yanfei: Great! Very well! I feel right at home, actually.
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Yanfei: Maybe you've forgotten, but this whole Sub-Space Creation thing is nothing new to me.
 So... you must be able to make your own one of these, right?
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship1 03a 1.ogg Yanfei: Well... it can be a little...
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship1 03a 2.ogg Yanfei: ...I—It's not my forte, okay!?
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship1 03a 3.ogg Yanfei: Anyway, I'm all settled in here now. Making my own would just be redundant.
 Then does the mighty and illuminated Yanfei have any suggestions?
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship1 03b 1.ogg Yanfei: One does, as a matter of fact! One thinks you should create a few rooms specifically for housing legal codices.
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship1 03b 2.ogg Yanfei: But this is your home, of course. The rules are yours to decide.
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Yanfei: You should worry about yourself, not me.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Yanfei: Chat? Oh, I don't know about you, but I can chat, for sure! Good luck trying to get me to stop talking...
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Yanfei: You seem like the quiet type, are you sure you won't find me too... animated?
 I'm sure I'll manage...
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship2 03a 1.ogg Yanfei: Oh... good!
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship2 03a 2.ogg Yanfei: I'm not sure why, but it's nice to hear you say that.
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship2 03a 3.ogg Yanfei: In that case, why don't you choose a topic?
 I'm quite happy just to listen.
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship2 03b 1.ogg Yanfei: Uh... Just to listen?
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship2 03b 2.ogg Yanfei: I don't think one person talking technically qualifies as a chat, per se...
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship2 03b 3.ogg Yanfei: I'm no storyteller after all — I already found my calling in life. I don't plan on spinning yarns for a living any time soon.
 Well then... let's chat about the difficult clients of yours.
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Yanfei: Huh? Of all the interesting topics you could choose, that's what you wanna talk about?
 Most of the time you successfully win them over.
 This way, we can figure out any outstanding issues.
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Yanfei: Oh... I—I see.
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Yanfei: Thank you...
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Yanfei: Ahem, then I'll start with a client who came to me with a civil case recently...
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
 Is there anything you'd like to do?
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Yanfei: Actually, I was thinking... Do you want to come fishing with me?
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Yanfei: Just the two of us, no one else. Not even your little friend here.
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Yanfei: Why not? Well, if you must know...
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Yanfei: It's no fun fishing by myself. No matter how many I catch, I only ever get to share them with Granny.
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Yanfei: Because, as you know, I can't reveal my true power in front of clients or friends.
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Yanfei: So whichever way you look at it, it seems you're the only suitable candidate there is.
 Feels more like I'm a last resort than an ideal candidate...
 Feels like you're making this up as you go along...
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Yanfei: No, no!
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Yanfei: Argh... Okay, okay. I just want to get out and have some fun with you.
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Yanfei: Peacefully, without anyone else interrupting. Just the two of us...
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Yanfei: You'll have a chance to see what I'm truly capable of, not just professionally...
 I never doubted you in the first place...
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship3 11a.ogg Yanfei: Oh, really...?
 But I am pretty good at fishing myself.
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship3 11b.ogg Yanfei: Oh ho? Well then, if I wasn't fired up before, I certainly am now!
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Yanfei: Then it's settled! I should warn you though, I have a tendency to view arrangements like these as contracts... No ducking out.
(Between 6:00 and 19:00)
 Morning, Yanfei.
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo morning 01.ogg Yanfei: Hey! Morning!
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo morning 02.ogg Yanfei: You should show a little more enthusiasm, like me! Hehe!
(Between 19:00 and 6:00)
 Good night, Yanfei.
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo night 01.ogg Yanfei: Night night, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!
Media:vo yanfei mimitomo night 02.ogg Yanfei: I—If you dream of any legal loopholes, I wanna know all the details as soon as you wake up!

Special Dialogue
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.

Cloudy Haze Dream-Court

Media:vo mimitomo ly yanfei bedroom 01.ogg Yanfei: I didn't know you had such a knack for home décor. This bedroom is quite suitable.
Media:vo mimitomo ly yanfei bedroom 02.ogg Yanfei: Speaking of the decorations, did you shop around to compare prices? And did you make sure that the artisan fees were at fair market rates?
Media:vo mimitomo ly yanfei bedroom 03.ogg Yanfei: Take me along next time you go shopping for furniture. I'll help you check all of that so you don't unexpectedly overpay for anything.

Glittering Street

Media:vo mimitomo ly yanfei store 01.ogg Yanfei: You wouldn't see any operational mistakes in this commercial area even during a busy festival season.
Media:vo mimitomo ly yanfei store 02.ogg Yanfei: I can tell that you've put a great deal of time into this.
Media:vo mimitomo ly yanfei store 03.ogg Yanfei: Do you plan to attract more shops? I can provide you with legal support.
