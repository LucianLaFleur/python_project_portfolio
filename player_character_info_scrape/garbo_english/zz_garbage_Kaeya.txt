Appearance[]
Kaeya wears a dark blue blouse with open-cut shoulders, revealing his dark top underneath; a feathered cape with his Vision attached to the back; beige harem pants; and dark boots. His hair is braided with a peacock feather on the end. He is embellished with gold jewelry and a bronze-trimmed eyepatch

Description[]
"Kaeya, why does the Dagger Bandit always carry daggers?"
Within the city of Mondstadt, two Knights of Favonius, one large and one small, are chatting.
Many days have already passed since they played the roles of bandit and mage on the stage, and even now, the small knight has questions about that which she does not yet understand.
*ahem* The reason the bandits carries daggers... The reason was never explained in Kaeya's script.
Perhaps it's because the character needed a catchy name, and the director just excitedly scrawled the words, "the Dagger Bandit."
But the small knight in front of him sat with furrowed brow, deep in thought, more serious even than when thinking about what was for dinner.
The boundless curiosity of children makes them always want to ask questions. Even if the endless stream of questions can be a bit annoying for adults, if their curiosity is not satisfied, they may lose that spark of curiosity, and turn into a boring adult.
Of all the infinite possibilities in life, becoming boring is one of the worst and most tragic outcomes, so a child's questions should always be treated with care.
"Hey, that's right, why is that? You asked a great question, Klee..." Kaeya replied with a smile.
Perhaps because he was briefly a bandit on that stage, he too had thought about lives lived that were not his own beneath the bright lights.
Knights live as knights do, and bandits live as bandits must.
Justly taking up sword and bow and standing forth to show their determination to protect, that is a knight.
But hiding one's blade and closing the net on their prey in the darkness, that is a bandit.
Different people live in different ways. A thief will not bear the blade of a knight, and a traditional knight will not sneak out a hidden dagger to hurt someone.
If the characters in the story don't abide by such rules, then the story has betrayed the roles dictated by fate.
But there is no need to give such answers to a child, and there is never just one answer to a question.
The daggers used by the Dagger Bandit were gifts from his friends, or symbols of his career as a virtuous bandit, or commemorated past acts of charity...
Let's fabricate a fairytale, and weave heroes, legends, and beautiful fantasies together, just like each time before, and give children a dream to dream.
He turns around and takes the dagger from the side of the costume hanging in the room:
"It's actually a complicated tale, and we'll have to start from when the big bandit was just a little kid. Would you like to hear about it, Klee?"
"Are you going to tell me another story, Kaeya? I'm listening!"

Personality
An accomplished swordsman and a strategic thinker in the Knights of Favonius, rumored to hail from beyond Mondstadt.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Kaeya is an outwardly confident and charming individual with a flair for drama. He is sometimes seen as overly laid-back and even lazy, but he takes his work seriously. He is surprisingly popular among the elderly of Mondstadt, even earning himself the title of "top candidate for grandson-in-law." His charisma and determination have earned him the admiration, respect, and favor of many people in Mondstadt — yet, his love for provoking others has also gained him the exasperation of those same people. Kaeya also enjoys putting people into high-stress situations and challenging their values, which he does to both his enemies and his allies alike. He takes pleasure in seeing the hesitation in his comrades' eyes at the moment just before they dive into battle with him, just as he takes pleasure in the look of fear in his enemies' eyes as they face off against him.
He seems to get a kick out of telling bold-faced lies and convincing others to do his work, but this serves him well in his role in the Knights of Favonius. He is a self-proclaimed "anti-hero with an attitude problem;"[2] as long as everything ends the way he wants, Kaeya does not care about the methods used. Still, according to his informant Vile, he draws the line at working with those who threaten other people's families, believing they deserve to be "hunted down and destroyed."
Despite his extroversion, the Traveler has observed that he appears to struggle with loneliness, though he playfully deflects when confronted about it.[3] He frequently reminds the Traveler that they can talk to him, invites them to spend time with him, insistently offers (sometimes extensive) assistance, and often voices his disappointment whenever the Traveler has to leave, showing his desire to be helpful and aversion to being alone.

Appearance

Kaeya uses the tall male model. He has a tanned complexion and navy-blue hair with streaks of lighter blue, accompanied by a waist-length lock of hair that begins at the base of his scalp on the back of his head at the left. His visible eye is periwinkle with a diamond-shaped pupil that is shared with other characters known to be from Khaenri'ah. Over his right eye, he wears a gold-trimmed black eyepatch that is mostly covered by his bangs. Kaeya has not been seen without his eyepatch, but his right eye, which is functional, is implied to have a scar over it due to being wounded by Diluc during their battle after Crepus' death.[4][5]
Notably, while other Mondstadt characters' Vision casings feature three feathers per wing, Kaeya's Vision on his default outfit only features two feathers. He is also the only one with a wing on the right side of the back of his Vision (other Mondstadt Visions have them on the left side or no wings at all on the back). Kaeya is one of only two characters across all nations who has a Vision with clearly nonstandard casing, with the other character being Furina.

Character Stories
Character Details
Kaeya Alberich is an adopted son to the Ragnvindr Family, the renowned wine tycoon.It has been a long time since he last called Diluc Ragnvindr "brother."Kaeya currently serves as the Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius, and is trusted by Jean.Kaeya is often the one wrapping things up in every incident that occurs in Mondstadt's vicinity.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
It is a curious fact that your best chance of finding Kaeya is not by visiting the Knights' headquarters, but by frequenting the taverns at night.Kaeya is often found sitting at the bar, gossiping with the city folk, and sipping the famed Mondstadt beverage, Death After Noon.He is surprisingly popular among the elderly of Mondstadt, even earning himself the title of "top candidate for grandson-in-law."It's hard to imagine someone as mischievous, amiable, and wine-loving as Kaeya being the Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius.Hunters and bandits alike are often among Kaeya's drinking buddies. As wary of him as they may initially be, all are ultimately disarmed by his smooth talking, and end up telling him everything he wants to know.Depending on what they then make privy to Kaeya, their night may turn into an uncontrollable nightmare or remain one of harmless banter."Everyone's got a secret, but not everyone knows what to do with it."Says Kaeya, with his usual arrogant smirk.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
"Justice is not an absolute principle, but is the result of striking that fine balance between strength and strategy. As for the details of how it's done... Don't worry yourself too much about that."Kaeya once said these words in front of Grand Master Varka.As long as everything falls into place the way he expects in the end, Kaeya doesn't care all that much about how it's done.This cavalier attitude is what defines his character.Not that different from Death After Noon's wild and explosive taste, one might add.However, his reckless approach to things is not uncontroversial.Once, in order to force a bandit leader into facing him directly, Kaeya triggered the Ruin Guard at an ancient ruin to cut his opponent off, putting his own men at risk in the process.It's times like these when even Jean, who puts a lot of trust in Kaeya, finds herself shaking her head in disapproval.Not that this bothers Kaeya, of course. On the contrary, he actually enjoys putting people into the difficult position of making tough decisions.He takes pleasure in seeing the hesitation in his comrades' eyes in the moment just before they dive into battle with him, just as he takes pleasure in the look of fear in his enemies' eyes as they face off against him.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
The flourishing winery business in Mondstadt has been a great source of prosperity in the region over the years. This prosperity often entices greedy bandits and monsters to the area.They are a motley bunch who hide in the shadows, and their backgrounds, motives, and allegiances are varied and complex.Kaeya battles against this threat to Mondstadt not only with his sword, but also with his smarts and his wit.A young knight once dedicated years of his life to studying threats in and around Mondstadt, and reached an astounding conclusion:When Death After Noon is out of season due to lack of supply, the number of reported incidents inside and outside the city show a drastic decrease, and this remains the case until Death After Noon returns to the market...The young knight showed his findings to Cavalry Captain Kaeya in hopes of getting some advice from him."Interesting. I'll look into it." Kaeya answered, with a wry smirk on his face.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Generally speaking, Kaeya is an easy person to have a conversation with. The only topic that you will never hear him discuss is his past.Even when the Grand Master demanded information on his background, Kaeya skirted around the issue and gave only vague answers devoid of details."One afternoon near the end of summer a decade ago, my father and I passed by the Dawn Winery.""'I'll go get us some grape juice for the road,' he said, but he never came back.""If Master Crepus hadn't taken me in, I doubt I'd have made it through the storm that night."This matter-of-fact description hides a carefully constructed lie.Kaeya has never once spoken the truth about what happened that afternoon:"This is your chance. You are our last hope."Kaeya's father squeezed his son's lean shoulders as he spoke, seemingly looking right through Kaeya to some place far beyond.On the other side of the horizon sat their distant homeland of Khaenri'ah.Kaeya would never forget the look of both hope and hatred in his father's eyes as he uttered those words.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Many citizens still remember the two most eye-catching young gentlemen in all of Mondstadt a few years ago.One of them was the dapper Diluc, an elegant swordsman who always had a warm smile and a confident posture.The other was the eccentric Kaeya. He was Diluc's friend, supporter, and sounding board, ensuring he got through every challenge he faced smoothly.They were almost like twins, knowing each other's thoughts and intentions without a word, protecting Mondstadt in both light and dark....Until that fateful day, now ingrained deep in Kaeya's memory, when the convoy that Diluc was escorting was attacked by a huge monster.It was the first and only time that Kaeya failed in his duty.By the time Kaeya finally reached Diluc, it was all over.The power their father had used to successfully fend off the attack backfired, taking their father's life.Both Kaeya and Diluc were shocked by what they had witnessed, losing the calm composure a knight should retain."Even someone like Master Crepus would submit to such a dangerous and evil power..."Sinister thoughts flashed through Kaeya's mind, and he simply smirked:"This world is truly... fascinating."All while their father lay dead in a pool of his own blood. It was on that night that the two sons' paths diverged.A List Friendship Lv. 4
Between the pages of "The Adventures of Angelos," you find a list of names written on a sheet of official Knights of Favonius letterhead paper.It meticulously records the details of bandits in the city and further afield, as well as mercenaries and mid-to-senior-level Treasure Hoarder members, listing for each entry a name, position, area of activity, and personal profile.A dozen or so names are circled, with a note in the margin saying "Otherwise, things would get too boring."When questioned about it, Kaeya's response is "I suppose I must have gotten drunk and started scribbling nonsense."Your gut feeling is that Kaeya purposely let you see this list, but you have no way of proving it.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
It was raining heavily in Mondstadt on the night that Kaeya Alberich received his Vision.Earlier that day, Crepus Ragnvindr had wielded the power of a Delusion — only to become its victim when it backfired. To set his father free from the unbearable agony, Diluc Ragnvindr took his life.Kaeya was Diluc's brother by adoption and was always by his side, but on this occasion Kaeya did not partake in the final moments shared between father and son.The torrential rain that set in on Mondstadt that night seemed to be a sign of the heavens' grief at the passing of Master Crepus.There was a side to Kaeya that he kept hidden from the world: In truth, he was an agent of Khaenri'ah, placed in Mondstadt to serve their interests. His father had abandoned him in this strange and unknown land to fulfill this mission, and it was Master Crepus and the city of Mondstadt that had welcomed him with open arms when they found him.If Khaenri'ah and Mondstadt went to war, which side should he support? To whom should he offer his assistance: his birth father, who had ruthlessly abandoned him? Or his adoptive father, who had loved him and raised him?For the longest time, Kaeya had agonized over these impossible questions, caught between the opposing demands of loyalty and duty, faced with an impossible choice between truth and happiness.But now, Crepus' death upset this delicate balance. He felt liberated, but also ashamed of how selfishly he was responding. As an adopted son, he should have saved Crepus, but he had arrived moments too late. As a brother, he should have shared in Diluc's grief, and yet as their father lay dying on the ground, he had hung back behind his brother, that ancient plot running through his mind.Consumed by guilt, Kaeya knocked on Diluc's door. As the rain poured down, the shroud of secrecy was washed away and all lies were revealed. Kaeya had finally come clean.He had anticipated Diluc's anger. The brothers drew their blades, this time pointing them at each other. Kaeya felt that this was his punishment for a lifetime of lies.But as the two crossed blades, Kaeya was overcome by the sensation of great elemental power surging through him. For years, he had stayed out of the way in his brother's shadow. But now, for the first time ever, he was facing his brother as his true self.Bitterly cold and brittle elemental energy burst forth from the tip of his sword to meet Diluc’s [sic] searing flames head-on. The clash of crimson fire and azure ice created a sudden swirl of wind that stunned them both. This was the grim moment at which Kaeya's Vision appeared.Since that day, Kaeya and Diluc have gone their separate ways. But he never discusses it, just as he never discusses the origin of his Vision.Though it is a reminder of a hard-fought battle, and the prize that he earned in exchange for revealing the unadulterated truth, Kaeya sees it as a stern reminder that he must live the rest of his life under the heavy burden of lies.

Other Appearances
Manga
Kaeya is a major character in the manga, which takes place roughly a year or less before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt.
Kaeya and Diluc rebuff Krupp's recruitment attempt for the Fatui. Later, due to the similarities between the powers from the Black Fire Incident and the powers of the Ragnvindr Delusion, Kaeya initially suspects Diluc before discovering that Collei is the true culprit. Kaeya initially sets out to kill Collei but is stopped by Collei's acceptance of her death as well as the timely arrival of Amber.
Kaeya then enlists Diluc's help; after Diluc poses as the perpetrator of the Black Fire Incident, Kaeya "arrests" Diluc and hands him over to the Fatui to close the case. After Diluc escapes and arrives back in Mondstadt, Kaeya returns Diluc's Vision under the guise of gifting him a vase.

Trivia
When cooking a Chicken-Mushroom Skewer, Kaeya has a small chance to create Fruity Skewers instead.
His "fruity" skewers don't actually contain fruit; the fruitiness comes from marinating the chicken in sparkling white wine.[6]
Kaeya's favorite wine is Death After Noon, a particularly strong wine. Death After Noon is a reference to the cocktail Death in the Afternoon, also known as Hemingway Champagne.[7]
The Steambird's Teyvat Food Notes column (which are blog posts on the Chinese official site) celebrated Kaeya's birthday with a real-life recipe for Fruity Skewers and Death After Noon.[6]
The Teyvat Food Notes are written in-character, with Long Erjun (the Traveler) as its columnist. After the recipe for Death After Noon, Long Erjun remarks that he can't drink it.
Kaeya and his relationships with other members of the Ragnvindr Clan are referred to with the following terms in the original Chinese version of his Character Details, his Vision story, an interactable during Hidden Strife, Archon Quest Destined Encounter in Chapter III: Act VI - Caribert, Event Story Quest Of Ballads and Brews: Act II - Bonds of Melody, Taste of Home in Kaeya's Hangout Event: Act I - Shenanigans and Sweet Wine, and Flame Born (Chapter 2 of the manga):
Diluc's 义弟 yìdì, "sworn younger brother," while Diluc is referred to as 义兄 yì xiōng, "sworn older brother."
The latter term is also used by Dwarkanath to describe her adoptive brother Iradj.
These terms make it likely that Kaeya is younger than Diluc, but not guaranteed. (For example, the birth year of Guan Yu (? – 220), a sworn younger brother of Liu Bei (161 – 223), was traditionally considered to be 160.[8])
The meaning of "sworn brothers" is complex and usually refers to a delicate bond built from trust and honor between close, unrelated friends.
Diluc's 兄弟 xiōngdì, "brother".
A 义子 yìzǐ, "foster son" to the Ragnvindr Family and Crepus's 养子 yǎngzǐ, "adopted son," while Crepus is referred to as 养父 yǎngfù, "adoptive father" and 义父 yìfù, "adoptive father."
Kaeya's official Chinese profile provides some additional information about him:
The people of Mondstadt find Kaeya a lot easier to deal with than his predecessor, Diluc.
Margaret, the boss of Cat's Tail finds his sense of humor amusing.
Bennett trusts him as an omniscient big brother.
Flora has a good impression of him because his eyes are extraordinarily "deep."
He has completed mission after mission, constantly proving that he is smart, reliable, and "indispensable."
In childhood, Kaeya used his eye patch to play-act as a one-eyed pirate, and to this day claims he inherited it from his grandfather, a pirate.[9] In reality, he currently wears it to hide a scar acquired in his fight with Diluc after their father's passing, and his birth family, the Alberich Clan, were the ruling regents of Khaenri'ah following the cataclysm.[4]
In Chapter 7 of the manga, Kaeya is shown wearing an eye patch over his right eye when Crepus dies, implying he has always worn it, even outside of childhood games and prior to his injury.[10]
The eye patch he currently wears may be a different one from his first, as an older eye patch can be found in a hidden box alongside notes regarding both his birth and adoptive families in the Hidden Strife event.[4]
Several (though not all) other characters confirmed or presumed to hail from Khaenri'ah, such as Dainsleif and Pierro, cover the same side of their face in some way, if not their eye. Irmin, the last king of Khaenri'ah prior to its downfall, is also described as one-eyed.[4]
For an unspecified amount of time, Diluc seemingly believed he had blinded Kaeya during their confrontation, a misconception Kaeya privately decided to allow him to continue believing,[4] which he followed through on in a later letter.[11] However, in a message from Diluc to Kaeya sent thereafter, Diluc clarifies that he is aware Kaeya is not blind.[4] In response, Kaeya asserts that even if he isn't blind, he still has a scar.[5]
Kaeya is the first character to have both a Story Quest and Hangout Event.
Kaeya is known by these aliases or titles:
Cavalry Captain
Master Kaeya (by the Dawn Winery maids)
Captain Kaeya
Kaeya is mentioned in the descriptions of the following 3 Furnishings: Trusty Portable Lamp Landscape Accessory: Appropriately Sweetened Mysterious Lamp of Fate Ordained
Etymology
Alberich, Kaeya's family name, is a German name which means "ruler of supernatural beings (elves)." In Germanic legend, Alberich was a dwarf that guarded the Nibelung's treasure. Alberich was also the name of a prominent character in Der Ring des Nibelungen, a cycle of musical dramas composed by Richard Wagner.
Hagen, the son of Alberich, has a striking resemblance to Kaeya, Hagen is often described as cunning and one-eyed.
Kaeya's constellation, Pavo Ocellus, is Latin for "Peacock Eyespot."

I didn't count on that making him even more nervous... His smile looked as if it were plastered onto his face, and in the end, he even wrote me a letter of apology. Tsk-tsk. Does taking everything so seriously run in the Schmidts' blood?

Trivia
Kaeya's remarks about grape juice, his least favorite food, are a jab at Diluc — who hates the taste of wine and prefers grape juice.
In Kaeya's "Favorite Food" voice-over, he talks about the drink "Death After Noon." However, the actual voiced line has him say "Death in the Afternoon," which is the name of a real-life cocktail made with absinthe and Champagne.

Dialogue

Media:vo kaeya mimitomo hello 01.ogg Kaeya: Well hello, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo hello 02.ogg Kaeya: I didn't expect to see you again so soon.
 How do you like it here?
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Kaeya: Oh, I feel quite at home already.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Kaeya: Hmm, although I feel that "at home" doesn't express my feelings in their entirety.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Kaeya: "Surprised" is more how I'd describe the feeling I had when I first set eyes on this place.
 You mean, pleasantly surprised?
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship1 04a.ogg Kaeya: Exactly that.
 As in, it was a nasty surprise?
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship1 04b.ogg Kaeya: What? Of course not! It was a very pleasant surprise.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Kaeya: It's more beautiful than I imagined.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Kaeya: It's been a while since I moved here though, so the initial sense of surprise has mostly worn off. Now, this place feels comfortable, like somewhere I belong.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship1 07.ogg Kaeya: Heh, who'd have thought...

 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Kaeya: You've come to the right person.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Kaeya: Speak your mind. I'm more than happy to keep you company.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Kaeya: Hmm... Though it's too bad we don't have anything to wet our whistles with...
 Why do you like to drink so much, Kaeya?
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Kaeya: Well... largely because I like the taste.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Kaeya: But I can't deny that I also like how it makes me feel.
 I think I understand what you mean.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 06a 1.ogg Kaeya: Oh really? Just from listening to me describe it? Despite having never tried it yourself?
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 06a 2.ogg Kaeya: That's quite a unique talent.
 So what you mean is, you drink to numb the pain?
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 06b 1.ogg Kaeya: Goodness, look at you, leaping to conclusions... Do I look like I've been through that much?
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 06b 2.ogg Kaeya: I'm quite content with my life right now.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Kaeya: I have to say, though, that chatting with you is quite intoxicating...
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Kaeya: Actually, in much the same way that drinking is.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Kaeya: So, I suppose... I'm just greedy and want to enjoy both of these pleasures at the same time.
 So all in all, I'm just another layer in your cocktail of pleasure?
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Kaeya: Hahaha... What an interesting metaphor! I hadn't looked at it from that angle...
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 11.ogg Kaeya: Let me think...
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 12.ogg Kaeya: Hmm... Your analogy seems largely correct.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship2 13.ogg Kaeya: Save for one small detail — you, of course, are the main ingredient in said cocktail.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
 Anything you'd like to do?
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Kaeya: You're already here by my side, what more could I ask for?
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Kaeya: Though, I would like to know one thing. Is there any way in which I can be of assistance to you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 You really have a way with words, Kaeya...
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship3 03a 1.ogg Kaeya: Haha, how flattering!
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship3 03a 2.ogg Kaeya: As always, I speak only from the heart.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship3 03a 3.ogg Kaeya: Nothing would make me feel prouder than knowing that my words of advice are of some help to you.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship3 03a 4.ogg Kaeya: That would imply that you trust me and proves that I am capable of helping you solve your problems.
 Can I rely on your words of wisdom in the future?
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship3 03b 1.ogg Kaeya: I'm at your service.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Kaeya: In fact... would you like me to compile a guide for you...?
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Kaeya: It would contain all kinds of practical knowledge for at home and on the road, including the techniques I have developed for communicating with people from all walks of life. I'd like to share it all with you.
 That sounds extremely useful.
 You never fail to impress me, Kaeya.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Kaeya: Hahaha... My pleasure!
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Kaeya: I'd better get to work then...
(Between 6:00 and 19:00)
 Good morning, Kaeya.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo morning 01.ogg Kaeya: Morning to you too, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo morning 02.ogg Kaeya: Don't forget that I'm always here for you if you ever need to pour your heart out.
(Between 19:00 and 6:00)
 Good night, Kaeya.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo night 01.ogg Kaeya: Is it that time already? I'm not sure I'm ready to say goodbye.
Media:vo kaeya mimitomo night 02.ogg Kaeya: But then again... one has to get one's beauty sleep. Alright then, good night.

Special Dialogue
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.

Bird and Blossom Park

Media:vo mimitomo md kaeya park 01.ogg Kaeya: Staying here feels like being in Mondstadt. The only difference is that I won't be bothered by any of my duties as one of the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo mimitomo md kaeya park 02.ogg Kaeya: Imagine bringing a bottle of finely-aged wine here and having a taste... Now, wouldn't that be bliss?
Media:vo mimitomo md kaeya park 03.ogg Kaeya: When that time comes, let's chat as we do right now, friend.

Dawn Orchard

Media:vo mimitomo md kaeya vineyard 01.ogg Kaeya: Promise me that once the grapes ripen, you won't press them into juice. Grapes are best turned into delectable wine.
Media:vo mimitomo md kaeya vineyard 02.ogg Kaeya: ...Heh, I just remembered my days back at the winery.
Media:vo mimitomo md kaeya vineyard 03.ogg Kaeya: Why don't I let you in on the secrets of winemaking?
