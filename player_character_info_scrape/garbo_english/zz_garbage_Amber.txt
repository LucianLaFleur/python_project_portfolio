Appearance[]
Amber wears a jumper-like outfit composed of dark red shorts, a red and black top that has only a hood and sleves, a white and brown top with the Knights of Favonius crest in gold on the front, red stockings, and white thigh-high boots embellished with gold linings and symbols.
Amber's accessories include a leather belt with two small bags, and her Pyro Vision attached, gloves, a small belt on her right thigh, and gold-framed goggles. Her most distinguishing feature is the headband with the large red bow that rests on her head, resembling the shape of bunny ears. Additionally, her Vision has two red feathers attached below it.

Description[]
In the last three months, Amber has had a bone or three to pick with Wolfhooks. While out scouting, her uniform and stockings were torn by their sharp hooks, and unfortunately, her schedule was such that there was no time to get them fixed.
The Knights' logistics division gave her 3 sets of uniform of the same type initially, so wearing one out was not exactly a major emergency. But Amber loved those three sets quite dearly, and would have been quite upset regardless of which one was torn.
Even Baron Bunny had his design based on these uniforms — Amber recalled, with a twinge of sadness.
So when her mission ended, Amber would attempt to sew the damaged uniform back together, but despite her excellent skills, the marks of her needlework remained stitched into the fabric.
However, Amber would obtain a new uniform not half a month at the Knights' end-of-year meeting.
It was a fair bit more official, the craft was more ornate... And it was also stated to be more hook-proof than the previous version.
"On behalf of the Knights of Favonius, I'd like to present you, our one and only Outrider, with some new clothes! Thanks for all you've done for us so far." So Hertha, their logistics captain, had said.

Personality
Always energetic and full of life, Amber's the best — albeit only — Outrider of the Knights of Favonius.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Outrider for the Knights of Favonius, Amber is described as "a model for justice" by Kaeya. She fulfills her duties as an Outrider diligently, even though she's the only one left in the said platoon. She abides by the rules, except for when using her wind glider, having her gliding license revoked numerous times.
She has an outgoing personality, as one might find her talking to strangers as if they're acquaintances. She is passionate in everything she does, may it be helping the citizens or purging hilichurls. She wishes to be as great as her grandfather, a once loyal defender of Mondstadt. Even after he disappeared, she still defends Mondstadt in his place.

Character Stories
Character Details
Amber is an Outrider of the Knights of Favonius. In an age where Outriders are becoming obsolete, she continues on with her responsibilities.It takes a newcomer only a few days to feel right at home with this passionate girl.Whether it's before the Good Hunter's signboard, the banks of Cider Lake, or the tree tops at Windrise, one can find traces of this vigilant Outrider in red anywhere.Once spotted by her, no suspicious individual can ever escape her interrogation.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
From a young age, Amber has always had boundless energy and a positive outlook on life.Each day, she burns with a fiery enthusiasm that sees her go about her life like a whirlwind, smashing through any obstacle that stands in her way.At times, however, her excessive energy can make her quite the troublemaker.Needless to say, she was quite a handful when she was young. Her infamous deeds include accidentally dropping a bird's nest on her grandpa's head while trying to steal the eggs from it and setting a Dendro Slime's leaves on fire, causing it to scurry about like a wild animal. These minor offenses gained her some notoriety among hunters' camps.Somehow, Amber was always able to escape the scene of the crime whenever she caused an incident, and not even a veteran Outrider could catch up with her. Invariably, it was Amber's grandpa who ended up on damage control duty each time his granddaughter's misbehavior caused yet another incident.To Amber, her grandpa's silent, unconditional love was like a warm breeze that wrapped around her like a blanket. She knew that it was because of this love that he accepted her and took responsibility for her deeds, and she embraced it silently.But it was only on the day that her grandpa resigned from the Knights of Favonius that she finally understood the full extent of the responsibility he had borne all those years.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
Amber's grandpa was once the leader of a mercenary group. He came from Liyue Harbor and was tasked with protecting merchant caravans as they traversed Teyvat. One day, on a routine escort job, the caravan fell prey to a savage monster attack. He was the only survivor, saved by a doctor from the Knights of Favonius.Too ashamed to return home and anxious to repay the debt, Amber's grandpa joined the Knights of Favonius.Before long, he single-handedly founded the Outriders, trained each one of them personally, and began leading them on missions.It also wasn't long before he found love in the foreign land of Mondstadt and started a family.Years later, Amber was born into that family. During the day, she would crouch by the window and secretly watch him training the Outriders. At night, she would sneak into the yard and practice the moves he had taught that day.Amber's grandpa was touched by her enthusiasm, and decided to teach her everything he knew."When Mondstadt accepted me, it became my homeland. Then, I decided to watch over this new home of mine. Maybe one day, you will inherit this responsibility... Hah, but then, who knows what the future holds?"As the coarse skin of her grandpa's palm rubbed against her head, a bewildered but earnest Amber nodded energetically in response.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Something happened one day four years ago that profoundly changed Amber.That day, her grandpa left his coat of arms and sword in his office and simply disappeared, leaving no note and telling no one he was leaving.He had been the beating heart and the backbone of the Outrider division, and without his leadership they rapidly became undisciplined and lost their edge.A few failed operations later, the Outrider division was facing obsoletion. In the end, it was preserved as a part of the Knights' organization, but in name only. Experienced members either transferred to another detachment or resigned, and so few outriders stayed that they simply did not have enough people to fulfill their daily patrol duties.On top of this, rumors that Amber's grandpa had defected made recovery even more difficult for the struggling Outrider division.Amber personally experienced this entire episode, having just been admitted to the Outriders before it all began. With the decline of her squad, she experienced true loss and disappointment for the first time in her life. No longer her carefree former self, she was filled with a new determination: She was going to grow up and become a true outrider as quickly as possible, no matter what it took.She had never made an actual plan before, and lacked the maturity to know where to start. But what she did have was confidence and courage — and lots of it.She wanted to show she had inherited her grandpa's determination, and she wanted to find out where he had gone.But more importantly, she wanted to inherit her grandpa's former role and become a loyal protector of her homeland.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Life in the Knights of Favonius was not easy for Amber in the beginning.Being as young as she was and having just lived through the trauma of losing her grandpa, the senior knights made a point of taking special care of her.However, for a girl as desperate to excel as she was, being taken care of by others implied that she wasn't yet mature enough to stand on her own two feet.Accordingly, she voraciously sought out extra responsibilities and made this as visible as possible to her seniors.Finally, during an intense engagement with some monsters, the seniors noticed her bravery and resourcefulness in the heat of battle.That was the moment when they realized that their little girl was growing up.As she matured, she also became more at ease with herself. Whatever feedback she met with, be it praise, rebuke, silence, or taunting, her response was always the same."For sure, I may still have a way to go before I catch up with my seniors. But one day, I'm gonna be the best Outrider ever!"Amber is not prone to too much deliberation, preferring instead to speak her mind, truthfully and frankly, at every occasion.She firmly believes that she will not disappoint her grandpa.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Today, Amber is still the firecracker she always was, burning with endless passion and energy.Now that she's all grown up, Amber holds firm to her grandpa's teachings as she spreads her Wind Glider's wings and watches over the City of Freedom with the eye of an eagle and the cautious cunning of a bunny rabbit.The "Crimson Knight" is known throughout Mondstadt.The people are delighted to see the mischievous little girl they remember growing up to be a guardian they can rely on."Never fear, Outrider Amber is here!"Her self-confidence is simply unshakable:"I am Outrider Amber, the one and only outrider — which makes me the best one out there!"Amber's Journal Friendship Lv. 4
Amber doesn't make writing a daily diary a habit, only electing to write special or memorable events down in her journal."I finally caught that magical bird! It's called a Rami... something. I don't remember. But I've been chasing it for three days, and I've only been able to sit down for a proper meal today. That magical bird was a really cunning one, burrowing in the thick forest like that. Good thing I didn't give up! Best of all, Master Jean gave me special permission to pluck a feather plume from it as my reward. Hehe, I'll wear it at my side every single day!""I'm sure I followed the cookbook to the letter and grilled the meat for six minutes. But while the outside is charred, the inside isn't cooked yet... Did I not control the heat properly? But I really am hungry, so I'll just have to try again tomorrow. One day, I'll make the best steak, and I'll call it... the Outrider's Champion Steak!""I met a strange outlander today. I was suspicious at first, but as it turns out, this outlander is both reliable and capable. Ugh, come to think of it, what would I do if an enemy that strong showed up? ...I musn't [sic] fall behind. I must train harder!"Vision Friendship Lv. 6
Amber once believed that if she took on her grandpa's post, she would understand why he left Mondstadt.However, even when she officially became an Outrider, she was no closer to unraveling the mystery behind his wordless departure.Her grandpa had left nothing for her to find either, indicating that she would have to forge her own path.Amber floundered for a while, until she flipped through an old book of fables that she would eventually come to treasure."What you lacked was not wind, but courage. It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world."Amber realized that she shouldn't wait for directions from someone else, but that she should be like those courageous birds that spread their wings and flew into the blue skies."There must be something that only I can do. There must be."The moment she realized this, a Vision began to shine brightly at her hip.

Other Appearances
Manga
Amber is a major character in the manga, which takes place roughly a year or less before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt.
Amber befriends Collei after the latter's arrival in Mondstadt. Amber does her best to help Collei with her search while also investigating the Black Fire Incident, during which Amber discovers the metal birds planted by the Fatui and disables them before they can cause any harm. Amber also takes Collei to Ludi Harpastum festivities and shows Collei that people lead happy lives in Mondstadt.
Amber resolves to help Collei after she discovers that Collei is the culprit behind the Black Fire Incident but does not want to use her powers. Amber stands guard while Cyno seals away Collei's archon residue.[Note 1] Afterward, Amber faces Barnabas alone to protect Collei and eventually brings him down with Diluc's help.
There is also a flashback in the manga that shows Amber was present when Diluc resigned from the Knights of Favonius, as she was hiding in a cupboard to surprise her grandfather.

Trivia
Amber is closely affiliated with rabbits: her ribbon looks like perked bunny ears, her taunting doll is named Baron Bunny, and her constellation is a hare. The manga reinforces this theme as well.
Amber's grandfather hails from Liyue, making Amber at least quarter Liyue-descent.
In the Qingce Village Bulletin Board, one message talks about a person who went to Mondstadt to become a knight some 40 or 50 years ago, only to return to the village, where he can be found "skulking around." The message also remarks that the man is distinguishable by the way he rides a Wind Glider. This person might be Amber's grandfather after his disappearance.
It is possible that her grandfather is also the adventurer whom Granny Ruoxin fell in love with, who promised to settle down with her in Qingce Village but never returned from his expedition.
The Favonius Warbow's description talks about Amber's grandfather, and the last sentence in its description is referring to Amber.
Amber is seen wielding the Hunter's Bow in her splash art and the Favonius Warbow during Shadows Amidst Snowstorms.
Amber is known by the following aliases:
Cheerful Torchbearer (in Zero Hour Invokation)
Amber is mentioned in the descriptions of the following 2 Furnishings: "Concealing Leaves" Snowman Head: Huff-and-Puff
Notes

↑ Due to localization adjustments made after the manga's release, this term is no longer accurate. The original Chinese term refers to gods predating the rise of The Seven.

If a character's favorite furnishing set is placed in the same realm as the character for the first time, the character will automatically teleport to the furnishing set. Interacting with the character will initiate a special dialogue, after which the character will teleport back to their original position.

 Look at this view...

 So good to see you!
 Oh, hey there!

Dialogue

Media:vo ambor mimitomo hello 01.ogg Amber: Oh, hey there, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!
Media:vo ambor mimitomo hello 02.ogg Amber: It's so good to see you!
 How do you like it here?
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Amber: I like it a lot!
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Amber: I'm not too fussy about where I stay. After all, as an Outrider, I have to be able to adapt to all kinds of surroundings.
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Amber: If I had to, I could even sleep on a tree branch.
 That's some impressive survival skills!
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship1 04a.ogg Amber: Y—You really think so...?
 I hope you're more comfortable here than on a tree branch.
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship1 04b.ogg Amber: Hahaha, of course I am!
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Amber: Anyway, don't worry, this place is great!
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Amber: Sure!
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Amber: ...
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Amber: Sorry, I'm no good at telling stories. Not like Lisa or my grandfather... They seem to be able to fit a thrilling tale into every conversation.
 Haven't you been keeping a journal—
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship2 04a 1.ogg Amber: Huh!? How long have you known about that!?
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship2 04a 2.ogg Amber: N—Not that I've been hiding it from anyone, it's just that... well, you'd be flattered to read some of the entries...
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship2 04a 3.ogg Amber: ... But it's still a bit embarrassing to just let someone else read my journal!
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship2 04a 4.ogg Amber: Hmm... I guess I could pick out some excerpts from my adventures if you're interested.
 Sounds good to me!
 I'd like to hear more about your past.
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship2 04b 1.ogg Amber: My past...
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship2 04b 2.ogg Amber: Uh... I think you might find it a little boring. Besides, in hindsight, let's just say that little Amber was... a bit of a nuisance.
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship2 04b 3.ogg Amber: I mean, if you really want to know, I'm happy to tell you about it... but only if you promise you won't laugh at me!
 Sounds good to me!
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Amber: Okay! Where do I start...
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
 Anything you'd like to do?
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Amber: Let's have dinner together!
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Amber: It doesn't need to be anything sophisticated. I just want to enjoy the feeling of having a meal at home. It's quite different from eating out.
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Amber: Restaurants are convenient and all, and you can always trust that the food's gonna be good.
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Amber: But you only get that special cozy feeling when you're eating at home, you know?
 Yeah, I know what you mean.
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship3 05a.ogg Amber: Great! Then what are we waiting for?
 Alright, let's do it.
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship3 05b.ogg Amber: Really!?
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Amber: Right, we'll do some steak, and— Oh, wait... you must have had my Outrider's Champion Steak a million times already.
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Amber: You know what, it's high time I set myself a new culinary challenge.
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Amber: ...Ooh, and I know just the dish — today, I'll try my hand at a Sticky Honey Roast!
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Amber: Uh... But what if the smoke changes the color of your ceiling...
 I was thinking of painting it a new color anyway.
 Don't worry, I can help with the cooking.
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Amber: Hehe, you're so kind to me.
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Amber: Get ready for the most delicious meal you've ever eaten! ...Even if it takes me a few hundred times.
Media:vo ambor mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Amber: I can't wait...
(Between 6:00 and 19:00)
 Good morning, Amber.
Media:vo ambor mimitomo morning 01.ogg Amber: Morning, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!
Media:vo ambor mimitomo morning 02.ogg Amber: Don't forget, if you ever need an Outrider, just come find me!
(Between 19:00 and 6:00)
 Good night, Amber.
Media:vo ambor mimitomo night 01.ogg Amber: Good night! Don't stay up too late!

Special Dialogue
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.

Idyllic Town

Media:vo mimitomo md ambor village 01.ogg Amber: Newcomers who are learning how to use wind gliders will practice simple exercises in Springvale.
Media:vo mimitomo md ambor village 02.ogg Amber: Most of the buildings in Springvale only have two or three floors, which is an ideal height for those still getting accustomed to gliding.
Media:vo mimitomo md ambor village 03.ogg Amber: However, please remember to glide legally! The rules also apply here.

Of Hunting and Dancing

Media:vo mimitomo md ambor hillichurl 01.ogg Amber: You built such a spacious campsite — amazing...
Media:vo mimitomo md ambor hillichurl 02.ogg Amber: Can I practice my archery and scouting techniques here?
Media:vo mimitomo md ambor hillichurl 03.ogg Amber: Or maybe we can practice together! Let's compete and see who wins!
