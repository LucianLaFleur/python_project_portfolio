OverviewLoreVoice-OversOutfitsCompanionGallery
An outcast since birth, Aloy grew up in a harsh mountain wilderness near the tribe that shunned her. Fostered by an expert hunter, she trained to hunt with cat-like grace and deadly accuracy – but the things she most wanted to learn, he could not teach her. Most of all, she burned to know the circumstances of her birth – who her parents were, and why she was shunned by the tribe.Her quest for answers swept her into a wider and more dangerous world than she ever could have imagined. She encountered strange and powerful new tribes, ancient ruins rife with mysteries, and dangerous enemies, both human and machine.Eventually she learned that her origins and destiny were deeply tied to the fate of the world itself, and fought an epic battle to save it against the evil forces of an artificial intelligence from the ancient past.She thought that this would be the end of her journey. But there is always more to an adventurer's tale. She has now come to Teyvat in search of a new challenges.In this brave new world, Aloy is ready for the hunt!—Description from Official Announcement[1]

Character Stories
Character Details
Outcast, hunter of machines, Seeker, Anointed, Savior... Aloy had many identities in her original world, and she was destined on account of her genetics to be the heroine who would heal it.Now, she has arrived in a new world, full of never-before-seen challenges, and once again, she throws herself gladly into the hunt.Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Aloy was born an outcast, deeply rejected and feared by her tribe. She was raised in the rugged mountains near their tribal dwellings by the experienced Hunter, Rost.He taught her how to hunt: to have cat-like form and deadly accuracy. And yet, he could not pass the most important thing onto her — the truth of her birth. Who were her parents? Why had she been cast out?Unfortunately, the reasons for this were known only to the very High Matriarchs of the tribe who had exiled her.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
There was only one way to discover the identity of Aloy's parents — victory at the Proving, the tribe's annual hunting contest, in which the victor would be free to ask for a reward.She would train hard all her life for that event, but when the moment of trial came, the ritual would end in tragedy.Mysterious assassins slew the participating Hunters, and it was only through Rost's sacrifice that Aloy was able to escape.Later, Aloy would learn that she was the true target of the attack, for she had almost exactly the same face as an enigmatic, ancient woman.Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Aloy knew that she had to find these killers to understand her origins.Her pursuit brought her into a wild and dangerous world far beyond her imagination, bringing strange and powerful tribes, mysterious ancient ruins, and terrifying enemies — whether human or machine — before her.In the end, the true enemy, HADES, appeared before her. It was an artificial intelligence filled with malice, bent on cleansing the world of all life.There was only one way to defeat HADES: investigate her link with that ancient woman, that "Aloy from the past"... Or could she have been her mother?Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Hot on HADES' trail, Aloy traversed a great many ruins from the distant past, and ultimately discovered her origin: she was not born of human flesh and blood but was the result of cloning.The genetics of the woman who had saved all life 1,000 years ago had been the basis for her creation.This had not only granted her the abilities she had possessed since birth, but had also guided her destiny, for this genetic material was the key to preventing the second coming of the apocalypse.Armed with this knowledge, and with the help of allies from many tribes, Aloy was finally able to defeat HADES and its human and machine minions in a decisive battle in the shining city of Meridian.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
After defeating HADES, Aloy embarked on a new journey, pursuing ancient technologies and cleansing the land that HADES had trampled underfoot.In her long journey, she found every Old World Ruin that there was to be found in search of the Old Ones' lost secrets.In one ancient, dilapidated laboratory, she found something she had never seen before — a gleaming portal. As she drew close, she was enveloped by powerful energies, and she saw her own image within the portal as one looking into a mirror, feeling as if she were in two places at once.With a flash of light, the "world" that Aloy knew completely disappeared from her sight, and she now found herself in a strange, beautiful new world just waiting to be explored.

Trivia
Aloy's quality is displayed as a red background instead of orange, unlike other 5-stars.
This is likely because Aloy is a collaboration character.
Aloy and the Traveler are the only five star characters that can be obtained without using the Wish system. However, unlike the Traveler, Aloy is only available for a limited time and is acquired via the mail.
Aloy is the first character whose Constellations cannot be activated, as Aloy's Stella Fortuna is currently unobtainable.
Aloy wields the ascended version of the Predator in her official art.
Aloy is known by these aliases or titles:

Dialogue

Media:vo aloy mimitomo hello 01.ogg Aloy: Hey there, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). I sure get to see a whole lot of new things traveling with you.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo hello 02.ogg Aloy: I gotta say, I'd love to watch Sylens try and wrap his head around this, uh... teapot of yours.
 How do you like it here?
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Aloy: If you're asking whether it's a comfortable place to stay, I mean, sure. Of course it is.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Aloy: But um... I couldn't really see myself living here for the long term. Sorry.
 Is there something wrong with the place?
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship1 03a 1.ogg Aloy: No, nothing's wrong at all, everything's great. Very charming.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship1 03a 2.ogg Aloy: It's just that I'm more used to camping out in the wilds.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship1 03a 3.ogg Aloy: I'm sure you know by now — back where I'm from, not a day goes by without something to watch out for.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship1 03a 4.ogg Aloy: Like giant machines running around all over the place, or hostile tribes that always seem to have it out for you, or evil machines bent on global extinction...
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship1 03a 5.ogg Aloy: To go from a life like that to something so safe... It'll take me some time to adjust, that's all.
 You want to go on an adventure?
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship1 03b 1.ogg Aloy: Yes! Don't get me wrong, this is a nice place, but I need to get out. If I stick around here too long, my bowstring's gonna snap.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship1 03b 2.ogg Aloy: Next time we head out, I want you to give me the full story on these Ruin Guards I hear you talking about.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship1 03b 3.ogg Aloy: They sound like my kind of prey. Aim for the glowing part, right?
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship1 03b 4.ogg Aloy: That, plus after you defeat them, you can salvage their components...
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship1 03b 5.ogg Aloy: Strange components, sure, and probably not the kind that I could use to modify my gear. Still, they've gotta have their uses, I guess?
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Aloy: Sure. Something new to share with me?
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Aloy: You know, I've heard a lot of stories about you since arriving in this world.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg Aloy: For example, the time that you helped the knights from Mondstadt to defeat a dragon.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Aloy: And the time that you teamed up with the adepti in Liyue to defeat an ancient god from the ocean.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Aloy: Gods and dragons... Can't believe they really exist here.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Aloy: But whatever the crisis may be, you always step forward and join up with those who want to fight back, don't you?
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Aloy: It's because of people like you that both cities were able to survive and prevail.
 I only made a small contribution...
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Aloy: If that's what you call a small contribution, I think it might take saving the whole world to count as a major one.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg Aloy: Seriously, though, if the world ever does need saving, bring me with you.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship2 11.ogg Aloy: I've saved a world once before. I might be able to give you some pointers.
 Like "Never save the world on an empty stomach"?
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship2 12a.ogg Aloy: Ha, yeah, that's right. Trying to save the world when you can't stop thinking about food is pretty tough... The end of the world deserves your full, undivided attention.
 Like "There's strength in numbers"?
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship2 12b.ogg Aloy: Maybe. But sometimes you need to take the world on your shoulders in order to save it.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship2 13.ogg Aloy: Seriously, though. Trying to save the world is exhausting, especially when you're not even sure who's trying to end it.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship2 14.ogg Aloy: The worst part is, once you find out who's responsible, they're always so full of themselves, making out like you're the one in the wrong.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship2 15.ogg Aloy: You can't reason with them. It always comes down to a fight. I guess that's just the way it is.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
 Anything you want to do?
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Aloy: Of course. I want to go out exploring with you again. Visit new places, see new things.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Aloy: On that note, I've been meaning to ask you something. When we've been out on the hunt in the past, I've noticed you've actually got an edge over me.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Aloy: How did you learn to hunt like you do? Or rather... who taught you?
 I guess I'm self-taught.
 Nothing fancy, I'm afraid...
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Aloy: Ha. And modest about it too. So I guess you started out with natural talent and then worked at it relentlessly.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Aloy: Plus, you go on all these adventures to hone your skills. That's what's really shaped you into who you are today.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg Aloy: A lot like me, I guess.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Aloy: I started out okay. Then Rost really trained me up.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Aloy: He was a great hunter. And an even better man.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Aloy: ...
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Aloy: I hope he'd be proud of who I am today.
 I'm sure he would be very proud.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Aloy: Thanks. But to be honest, the only reason I started training in the first place was to win the Proving and get a boon from the Matriarchs. I wanted to know who my parents were.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 12.ogg Aloy: Back then, I never thought I'd be uniting everyone against an evil machine and its army.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 13.ogg Aloy: In fact, I probably would have found the idea of everyone uniting together even more far-fetched than the part about the evil machine.
 Nobody knows what the future holds.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 14a 1.ogg Aloy: Yeah. But I actually kind of like that feeling of not knowing.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 14a 2.ogg Aloy: Going out into the world, exploring the unknown, embracing new challenges, that's what I'm used to.
 I would love to visit your world.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 14b 1.ogg Aloy: If you ever do have the chance, you should take it.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 14b 2.ogg Aloy: My world has its troubles. But it's worth seeing. And worth saving.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 15.ogg Aloy: But didn't you tell me before that you aren't from this world? You came here as a traveler, too, didn't you?
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 16.ogg Aloy: And you ended up staying to look for your missing sibling, correct?
 Yes. I wonder where (‍shesheText for Aether/heheText for Lumine‍) is now...
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 17a.ogg Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 17b.ogg Aloy: Don't worry. As long as (‍shesheText for Aether/heheText for Lumine‍) is still in this world, the two of you will meet again.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 18.ogg Aloy: That's if I have a say in the matter. As a fellow outlander, I won't let you do this alone.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 19.ogg Aloy: I'll be ready to help whenever you need me.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 20.ogg Aloy: Wherever the hunt leads, I won't turn you down.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 21.ogg Aloy: In the meantime... when you have a moment, tell me more of what you know about this world.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo friendship3 22.ogg Aloy: Starting with hilichurls, Abyss Mages, and Geovishap Hatchlings... I still don't know where any of their weak spots are!
(Between 6:00 and 19:00)
 Morning, Aloy.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo morning 01.ogg Aloy: Good morning. The coast looks clear. Don't forget to come get me before you head out.
(Between 19:00 and 6:00)
 Evening, Aloy.
Media:vo aloy mimitomo night 01.ogg Aloy: Good evening. It's so quiet here, I mean, completely still... That's gonna take me some getting used to.

Special Dialogue
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.
Inviting them to the furnishing set again will replay the dialogue, but no further reward will be given.

Iter Ad Astra Abyssosque

Media:vo mimitomo md aloy park 01.ogg Aloy: For a makeshift base, this is well put together. Whoever was responsible clearly knew what they were doing.
Media:vo mimitomo md aloy park 02.ogg Aloy: The tents are sensibly positioned in relation to one another, and the fencing shows they were well aware that danger can approach from any direction.
Media:vo mimitomo md aloy park 03.ogg Aloy: It's reassuring when you know you can rely on your companions.

Of Hunting and Dancing

Media:vo mimitomo md aloy vineyard 01.ogg Aloy: This camp is interesting. The lodgings and the furniture are crude, but if you look closely, the layout does seem to have an order to it.
Media:vo mimitomo md aloy vineyard 02.ogg Aloy: It's tribal. Feels a bit familiar... but different, too.
Media:vo mimitomo md aloy vineyard 03.ogg Aloy: Maybe if I stick around long enough, I can learn something from this land.
