Personality
A descendant of King Deshret with an amber left eye. The defender of Aaru Village.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Candace is a tall, and slender young woman who serves as Aaru Village's guardian. She protects the inhabitants from the dangers of the Great Red Sand, such as bandits and natural dangers. She treats all visitors to the village with utmost respect regardless of wherever they come from as long as they abide by the village's rules. However, should they endanger the village or its inhabitants, Candace is shown to be extremely ruthless and terrifying.

Appearance
See also: Desert and Night
Candace uses the tall female model. She has tan skin and dark blue hair. Her eyes exhibit a form of heterochromia iridum: Her right eye is dark blue and her left eye is golden yellow.

Official Introduction
Of red sands and glimmering gold, her vow to defend stands strong
I once gave Candace some jewelry and told her to learn to enjoy life and find happiness outside of work. She replied that seeing the village in peace was enough to make her happy... Well, this guardian really has a unique way of enjoying life...—An exasperated comment from Dehya, the Flame-Mane.
"That Candace... is a true descendant of King Deshret!"
At a tavern in Sumeru City, a disheveled member of The Eremites exclaimed in fear.
The guardian with different-colored eyes has received the blessing of the gods and is able to summon a sandstorm that engulfs all enemies instantly.
A former member of the Treasure Hoarders, who recently claimed to have quit, added that Candace can also summon the power of the desert. Every grain of sand is her scout and no one can escape from her grasp.
But a young adventurer who was about to leave for the desert looked surprised. He replied that Miss Candace, the guardian of Aaru Village, was actually a gentle and caring person.
During a visit to Aaru Village, he had seen Miss Candace bring water and food to a hungry Treasure Hoarder, and arranged for another exhausted mercenary to rest in the guest room... In the eyes of this adventurer, "terrifying" is the last word one could use to describe this guardian...
Candace, who is far away in the Great Red Sand, was unaware of this little debate about her - although she doesn't mind what people think about her.
As the guardian of Aaru Village, it is her duty to protect the peace of the village.
As long as they abide by the rules of Aaru Village, anyone can seek refuge here and receive the help they need.
As for those who violate the rules and commit atrocities in the village...
Candace will personally ensure that they never harm the village again.

Character Stories
Character Details
Candace, who has heterochromatic eyes, serves as the guardian of Aaru Village.Candace always shows the greatest kindness to all travelers visiting the village, and she will not pursue an inadvertent faux pas so long as that person corrects themselves in time. In Candace's view, the village rules are the most important thing. So long as these boundaries are respected, anyone can be allowed to rest in Aaru Village.But woe betide those who regard this tolerance as weakness. Those who try to do anything illegal in Aaru Village will definitely pay the price.By then, they will find that Candace's lance and shield truly are the most frightening of weapons.The scion of Al-Ahmar, a member of desert folk, the Guardian... Candace, burdened as she is with multiple identities, also bears the eternal responsibility of guarding Aaru Village."This village only welcomes those who can follow the rules."Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
"Aaru Village is the final refuge for King Deshret's descendants." "The mission of the Aaru Village's Guardian is to guard the village till the last of King Deshret's people fade away."When Candace was officially appointed as the new "Guardian" at the tender age of eight, the one who handed the position over to her admonished her as such.With King Deshret's death, it was already a blessing that his descendants might have such a refuge from the world.And so, generation after generation, the Guardians take up their duties in silence, defending countless villagers until they pass on as the "descendants of King Deshret" and gain eternal peace.It was once the common wish of the residents of Aaru Village to fade away in peace, sequestered in their village.However, when new life emerges in this ancient village... Everything that they used to know might just have to change a bit.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
When Uncle Anpu, the village head, announced that a caravan from Sumeru City was about to arrive in the village for trade, the former Guardians could hardly believe their ears.They indignantly accused Uncle Anpu of undermining tradition and requested that Candace, the current Guardian, do her duty by summoning guards to drive the merchants out.However, Candace refused the request, for she had already reached an agreement with the village head that the village must make changes for the future of its residents.They kept explaining, but the former keepers did not relent, and it was even suggested that if Candace was unwilling to do her duty, they would take up arms again and carry out a Guardian's work themselves. At last, a clang of lance against shield silenced all the quarrels. With lance and shield in her hand, Candace stood up and looked around with a smile, before announcing to the stunned elderly folks around her:"It is good to see you all in such good spirits.""But I am the current Guardian of Aaru Village, so please, go and rest, as you should."The persuasive power of weapons trumped words at this moment, and it seemed that it would be enough to end the fracas.After a moment's preparation, Candace accompanied the village head in her station as Guardian to formally receive the caravan and hold trade negotiations with them, before personally escorting them out of the village.A few days later, the merchants visited again and completed this seemingly humble transaction regarding cloths.This batch of merchants returned to Sumeru City with news of the success of the deal. Soon after, a new topic cropped up among the business-folk of Sumeru, one which had been rarely heard of in the past:"Hey, you know what? Someone went to Aaru Village to do business — and they made a good sum of Mora, too. Think we should give it a shot next time...?"Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
In truth, Candace doesn't often use her lance and shield as debating tools.The children in Aaru Village have always believed that "Big Sis Candace" will only frown no matter how angry she is — at most, she might ask the children in trouble to copy the calligraphy prepared for them by Grandma Kulsoom several times.The other guards in Aaru Village believe that although Candace's requirements are strict, she will not give out corporal punishment to those who slack off or whose physical abilities are not up to par, and that she will simply guide them with more care instead.The older folks in the village, for their period, note that Candace is a person who will not let negative emotions show on her face, and indeed, she has never once looked sad in front of them.Even the merchants who visit the village will be received by Candace with the utmost hospitality. From introductions to accommodations, she arranges everything in good order.Perhaps she might even be too gentle for the merchants' comfort.After all, this village is next to Great Red Sand. Leaving the monsters aside, lawless bandits must have long had this village in their sights.Is the Guardian truly capable of protecting everyone... and their business as well?One night, a drunken merchant dared to ask:"Guardian, we can do business in this village, no problem. But as you know, this desert is a real den of outlaws...""You need not worry about this. Only those who obey the rules shall be guests in Aaru Village. As for those who don't..."Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Those who do not respect the rules shall be the "enemies" of Aaru Village.Whether they be Eremites hiding in the sands, bandits disguised as adventurers, or Treasure Hoarders attempting to steal goods...Anyone who dares to invade the village, no matter how they may try to hide and escape, will eventually receive the punishment they deserve.Those who sincerely confess their guilt will be forgiven and given enough supplies to cross the sands, but never again will they be permitted to show their faces around Aaru Village.As for the more recalcitrant sort...Their despicable souls shall find company only with the desert sands.A former member of The Eremites once warned his companions that Candace, the terrifying Guardian of the village, is a true descendant of King Deshret.The shield in her hand possesses the blessing of Al-Ahmar, such that as long as its wielder holds it tightly, every grain in the great desert will heed her call. So if Candace so wishes, she could even send forth a huge sandstorm to engulf all her foes.Not only that, her amber left eye can also perceive the future and read the fates of others. Indeed, such is her terrible might that none can ever escape her pursuit.Such are people's beliefs concerning Candance, that she has swept all of Aaru Village's enemies away by virtue of these divine powers.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
Only Candace herself knows that she has never really felt the blessing of Al-Ahmar."The Guardians have never been blessed by the grace of god" — this is a secret handed down from Guardian to Guardian.Only when a new Guardian takes up their shield will they be told the truth.The effects of the truth on those now in the know has varied. Some gave up and became so despondent that they stopped practicing martial arts. Some came to believe that since they were not being watched, they didn't have to obey the rules either, and so acted recklessly, even in violation of the law.But Candace was not depressed."My lance and shield are not wielded as a prayer for a god's blessing.""My duty will not change, regardless of whether any god favors us or not."She practices diligently day after day and through this has forged both an extraordinary will and martial skills.Many who have visited Aaru Village have extended invitations to Candace, wondering why someone as capable as her would choose to live in such an inconspicuous place. If she was willing to leave, they often say, she may yet be able to start a new career...Yet Candace always answers them thusly:"A Guardian will not leave what they have purposed to protect."Candace's Trinkets Friendship Lv. 4
Candace often buys all kinds of trinkets from merchants who visit Aaru Village.Hairpins adorned with aquamarine beads, headbands made of silk and satin, gilded necklaces, metal bracelets engraved with Kalpalata Lotus patterns, pendants with the emblems of the Akademiya's colleges drawn upon them...While Dehya has encouraged her to dress up more often and use the Mora she spends on herself, Candace feels that some things are too fragile to survive her daily work environment, and so she puts them deep in her wardrobe.So it seems that these trinkets will come in handy only when Candace temporarily puts her duties aside and changes into other clothes to have a rest in the shade — or perhaps she might just give it to a friend as a gift.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
With outsiders pouring in, Aaru Village was faced with a variety of unprecedented circumstances.They now had Treasure Hoarders pretending to be businessmen within the village, mercenary groups hijacking trade caravans, unscrupulous vendors engaged in charlatanry...Moreover, after seeing people who came from abroad, the residents of Aaru Village gradually began to yearn for life outside. Gradually, people tried to go out to make a living, and fewer and fewer young people were willing to stay in the village.The former Guardians had long been dissatisfied with Candace, who, as they saw it, had "abandoned" their traditions. Seeing that the village was in such a situation, they again held a meeting and prepared to challenge her."What we Guardians must do is maintain order in the village!""Candace! What you have done will only cost this village its peace!""Candace! Go and fulfill your duties now!"As the war of words swayed back and forth, the lance-wielding female warrior suddenly shot up to her full height."That's enough!""If you only wish to protect the 'past' of this village, then do it yourself! Whether you wish to just remain in your homes or leave Aaru Village, that is up to you!""I will not let the people of Aaru Village be bound by the past forever.""If you can't move forward, then it's up to me to protect our future!"The old Guardians were intimidated by her, her young, fiery eyes making it impossible for them to come forward and question her further.Burning with rare anger, Candace hefted her long spear and stormed out of the dispute-ridden hut.And, as if in response to her convictions, a shining "jewel" had appeared at the tip of that lance, though she knew not when it had done so.The eyes of the gods had found her, and they had given her their approval.A "Vision" is also a resolute heart — and no finer ornament than it may be found anywhere.

Trivia
The symbol on Candace's forehead is likely a reference to the symbol of the Millennium Items in the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise, being virtually identical to the fictional symbol created in that series.
As explained in her Character Story 1, Candace's title as a "descendant of King Deshret" is not a literal descendancy, but rather a term used to refer to all people of Aaru Village as it is the last bastion of his civilization, being as well a title which all Guardians of Aaru Village are known as.
Candace is mentioned in the descriptions of the following 7 Furnishings: Athelwood Metal Buckler Desert House: Brief Sleep Desert House: Hidden Light Desert House: Ordinary Lives Desert House: Save and Store Desert House: Spices Abound Desert Wall: Stalwart Defense
Etymology
Her name originates from Greek and Roman sources wherein the title Kandake, a term used for the sister of the King of Kush, was incorrectly assumed to be a hereditary proper name of the "Queen of the Ethiopians" and Latinized as "Candace." The most prominent such source is older translations of the Biblical book of Acts (Acts 8:27), but according to the Roman author Pliny the Elder this use was common in Roman literature.
Her design references many Egyptian symbols, with the eye on her forehead a stylised version of the eye-symbols associated with the gods Horus and Ra, her heterochromatic eye similar to Horus where one represents the sun and the other the moon (though Candace's are reversed from Horus') a starry pattern reminiscent of Nut, goddess of the sky, a winged insignia on her shield reminiscent of symbols associated with the goddess Isis or the neckpiece worn by the Pharaoh Tutankhamun, and an Ankh worn around her neck.
Candace's shield is said to be blessed by Bennu. Bennu is an Egyptian deity associated with the sun, rebirth, and creation, and was often depicted as a heron. Earlier depictions of Bennu, however, appear more like the Yellow Wagtail. Similarly, Candace's skill and burst reference the heron and wagtail respectively.

Lies pose no threat to us... the threat we face is the prospect of no tomorrow. The path before us is paved with barbs, there is pain in every step — yes, we tread forward clinging to a lie, but perhaps... perhaps there is more virtue in this than in selfishly embracing the truth, and death along with it...

But it's not possible. The past is but grains of sand, scattered to the four winds. The best we can do is to let go, and leave the wind to carry them to their final resting place.

Well, according to what people outside the village say, it has the blessing of Bennu. With this shield in hand, all the grains of sand are my eyes and ears, and the desert is ready to do my bidding... Their imaginations can get a little carried away sometimes. But anyway, that aside, the main thing for me is it always works a charm.

Seeing that all is still well gives me a sense that... if today is just like yesterday, and yesterday is just like all the days before it... things have always been pleasant here, throughout history.
Candace's Troubles Friendship Lv. 6Candace's Troubles Friendship Lv. 6Media:VO_Candace Troubles.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Candace_Troubles.ogg Every now and then, a few violent thugs make the mistake of trying to disrupt the peace and tranquility of Aaru Village. I do wonder... is chasing them into a monster-infested valley perhaps a little too... merciful? What do you think, do you have any better ideas on how they should be dealt with?
Favorite FoodFavorite FoodMedia:VO_Candace Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Candace_Favorite_Food.ogg To me... quantity is more important than taste when it comes to food. Life in the desert uses up more energy than you might think. After a day's work, there's nothing more satisfying than having a filling meal.
Least Favorite FoodLeast Favorite FoodMedia:VO_Candace Least Favorite Food.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Candace_Least_Favorite_Food.ogg I don't hate it, but compared to regular meat, eating fish is a real nuisance... Maybe it's because we don't really eat fish here in the desert, but for whatever reason, I'm just not very good at removing all those prickly little bones... This must sound ridiculous to you.

Media:vo candace mimitomo hello 01.ogg Candace: Oh, it's you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). How have your recent travels been?
Media:vo candace mimitomo hello 02.ogg Candace: If there's anything you need, just tell me anytime.
 Do you like it here?
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Candace: It's quite different from Aaru Village, but I feel at ease here nonetheless.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Candace: I was so surprised the first time I came in. Such a small teapot, and yet so vast on the inside...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Candace: If I could store Aaru Village in a teapot...
 Wanna give it a shot?
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship1 04a 1.ogg Candace: I was simply musing. Even if that were possible, what I seek to protect is not an object named Aaru Village...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship1 04a 2.ogg Candace: ...It is my homeland and the lives of everyone in it.
 That would definitely make things more convenient...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship1 04b 1.ogg Candace: Hmm... If I could easily take everyone someplace else...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship1 04b 2.ogg Candace: No, I suppose they wouldn't agree to leaving the desert in the first place.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Candace: I apologize for making you listen to all this...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg Candace: And, thank you for having me.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)
 Up for a chat, by any chance?
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Candace: Sure, but what should we talk about...?
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg Candace: If you don't mind, could you tell me about the places you've been to? Any of them will do.
 About the scenery and culture of Mondstadt...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship2 03a.ogg Candace: Verdant grass, a city of song and freedom...
 About the scenery and culture of Liyue...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship2 03b.ogg Candace: A nation of trade and contracts... I've heard about it before, but your description paints a whole new picture.
 About the scenery and culture of Inazuma...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship2 03c.ogg Candace: A land surrounded by the ocean, a castle built atop an island...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg Candace: I'd love to see it for myself.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg Candace: The desert has been my home my entire life. I hardly even journey to the other side of the Wall of Samiel.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg Candace: But after hearing you speak of all these faraway lands, I can't help but find the thought of traveling quite... enchanting.
 You should come with us!
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship2 07.ogg Candace: Ah, it truly is a tempting offer... But I cannot forsake my duty to protect Aaru Village...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship2 08.ogg Candace: Perhaps your words will take root within my heart, and one day, my desire to see the world beyond will sprout and grow.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg Candace: When that day comes, I shall follow your footsteps.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
 Anything you want to do?
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Candace: If you have time, would you like to hear me tell a story?
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Candace: You can sit by my side, or... something more casual, whatever makes you feel comfortable and relaxed.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Candace: Although I may be a village guardian with her spear and shield ever at the ready... Deep down in my heart, I've always loved cozy and calm atmospheres like this.
 Got it.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Candace: Great. So, just be yourself when you're around me.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Candace: Well then... weary wanderer of lands beyond, do you wish to hear about the ancient legend of King Deshret, or the history of Aaru Village?
 About the legend of King Deshret...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 06a 1.ogg Candace: King Deshret was an ancient god of the desert, known as "Ahmar" to the desert folk.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 06a 2.ogg Candace: He was the king of warriors, gardeners, and intellectuals alike. He controlled the howling winds in the desert, the sand dunes silvered by moonlight...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 06a 3.ogg Candace: And the thousand-and-one fairy folk who hide within the dreams of the night and the cries of the owl...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 06a 4.ogg Candace: His arrogant acts of folly led to his ruinous fate. The sands entombed his city, leaving only the sorrowful elegies of the Eremite songsters...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 06a 5.ogg Candace: Even now, most desert folk remain devout believers in King Deshret. The rumor that he will one day be resurrected has become their only hope for the future.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 06a 6.ogg Candace: People may find it hard to admit, but lies often soothe the heart more than the truth ever could.
 About the history of Aaru Village...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 06b 1.ogg Candace: In the past, the mountain and lake where Aaru Village is situated was a part of King Deshret's territory.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 06b 2.ogg Candace: As the god of the desert, King Deshret built a city from the golden sand and crimson rock, and called it "Akhtamun."
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 06b 3.ogg Candace: After King Deshret passed, the surviving residents of the city became the earliest inhabitants of Aaru Village, bringing their traditions and faith with them.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 06b 4.ogg Candace: Some time later, Aaru Village became a place of exile for scholars...
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 06b 5.ogg Candace: We are all born free, yet we are also inevitably bound by shackles.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 06b 6.ogg Candace: My apologies... Things got dark pretty quickly.
 You might feel better if you let everything out.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Candace: Heh, you're right.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Candace: We had a difficult past, and our lives at the moment aren't exactly easy, but it's our peaceful lifestyles that I wish to defend.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Candace: Thank you for patiently listening to all that I had to say. It feels like a burden has been lifted from my heart.
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Candace: Thank you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo candace mimitomo friendship3 11.ogg Candace: When you have time, I'll tell you more stories of the interesting things that happen in our village.
(Between 6:00 and 19:00)
 Good morning, Candace.
Media:vo candace mimitomo morning 01.ogg Candace: Good morning. Did you rest well last night?
Media:vo candace mimitomo morning 02.ogg Candace: The goddess of the night will be worried if you don't sleep well.
(Between 19:00 and 6:00)
 Good night, Candace.
Media:vo candace mimitomo night 01.ogg Candace: It's getting late. Now, off to bed you go.
Media:vo candace mimitomo night 02.ogg Candace: I hope the fathomless dark of the night will watch over your dreams and grant you a good night's sleep.

Dwelling Amidst the Sands[]

Media:vo mimitomo xm candace aaruvillageint 01.ogg Candace: Making a house feel like a home isn't about the physical objects. It's about creating a certain atmosphere...
Media:vo mimitomo xm candace aaruvillageint 02.ogg Candace: Warm, intimate, safe, secure, peaceful...
Media:vo mimitomo xm candace aaruvillageint 03.ogg Candace: Everything I seek to protect... it's all here.

Setekh Demurs[]

Media:vo mimitomo xm candace aaruvillageext 01.ogg Candace: I love Aaru Village's architectural style. Heh, I know I'm biased, but that's not the reason why.
Media:vo mimitomo xm candace aaruvillageext 02.ogg Candace: Just look at these intricate patterns and beautiful facades. The ancient style really adds a lot of character, and it's all the more majestic in such a tranquil environment.
Media:vo mimitomo xm candace aaruvillageext 03.ogg Candace: ...Can I stay here and admire it for a little longer?
