Personality
The young but highly accomplished head of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan. Cultured and polite, he is a man of many ways and means.—In-game character attributes and profile page text
Ayato is a person that does not like to show his face in public often, preferring to work on his duties as the Yashiro Commissioner. A well-known fact about him is that he's extremely busy and stressed, as he has to deal with corrupt government officials while juggling his duty as the leader of the Shuumatsuban. Due to his duties, he loathes small talk, wanting people to get to the point. He uses a large array of methods to deal with corrupt officials, usually within legal bounds.
While he is not particularly well known due to his preference to remain behind the scenes, those who are familiar with him note that he is incredibly kind and has inspired loyalty from many people. For example, Hirotatsu states that he continues to serve the Yashiro Commission to repay the generosity that he showed him and his master and it is strongly implied that Ayato was the one who inspired Thoma to the point the latter received a Vision. Ayato has stated that he highly values loyalty and obedience (hence his preference for dogs), as strongly implied that there were numerous assassinations against him in the past, hence why he values those two traits so much to protect himself from rival clans and organizations.[2][3]
Despite his succession as the family head at a young age, he appears to be a mature and determined man, notably even more than Ayaka, who's known for her steadfastness. Like Ayaka, Ayato cares for the well-being of the common people. He is also a family man, as he had taken the position of Commissioner per his parents' wishes to also protect Ayaka, stating that he would not forgive any who would harm his family and wanting to ensure that Ayaka had others to rely on when she needed it.[4] He also risked his life to smuggle the Watatsumi Army into Tenshukaku for the sake of doing a "small favor" for her.
Ayato is also known to be cunning and mischievous, as both the Shogun and Yae Miko note him as unpredictable and tricky to understand, with the latter strongly disliking him as a result. Nonetheless, he is tolerated by both for upholding the Shogun's will for the former and their duties generally aligning for the latter. Hiratsuka notes that whenever he hangs out with Thoma, he ropes him into eating strange food, causing Thoma to become terrified whenever he sees him. Itto remarks that Ayato is a "warrior" with great charisma, and that the two are "on the same wavelength". He is also able to find Sayu with ease despite not appearing to have much ninja training, even though the rest of the Shuumatsuban have difficulty locating her.

Ayato uses the tall male model. He has long pale blue asymmetrical shoulder-length hair, pale skin, and light purple eyes. He also has a small mole under the left corner of his mouth.

Official Introduction
Pillar of fortitude, a new branch of emerald glory
The game of politics is fraught with peril. Saying too little is not good, but saying too much is also bad. But don't get me wrong, my Lord does not take any joy in these 'battles.' For him, it's just... a matter of duty.—Thoma
As the head of the Yashiro Commission, Kamisato Ayato is committed to maintaining the prosperity and stability of the region.
At a glance, he is low-profile and graceful. He is not a fan of public appearances and does not seek to show his skills overtly.
But those who do know him understand that he is not to be underestimated. Long ago, when the Yashiro Commission fell on hard times, and when the Kamisato Clan was on the verge of crumbling, it was this young man who rose to the occasion and stabilized the situation.
He could not have achieved his position without extraordinary resourcefulness and cunning. But perhaps, that impenetrable smile belies darker waves.
However, the most intriguing thing is that in most of these negotiations in which he participates, he is not ruthless nor competitive, and is even willing to share the benefits so that everyone can get a relatively satisfactory piece of the pie.
"What exactly is he up to?" is usually what people are thinking after all is said and done.
However, now that everyone has a piece of that pie, perhaps what is on Kamisato Ayato's mind isn't so important.

Character Stories
Character Details
As clan head of the Kamisato Clan, one of the great clans of the Tri-Commission, Kamisato Ayato is a household name in Inazuma.However, people do not have quite the same clear impression of him as they do of the Shirasagi Himegimi, the elegant and kind Ayaka.Most only know that he is an important figure in the Shogunate and the head of a famed noble house. But as for the details, there's little that they can say for sure.Some people say that "the Yashiro Commission's festivals and events are ever meticulous and have been full of consideration for the people. Surely the Commissioner's hand is in all such matters."But others also say "ah, but there is much to politics that should never see the light of day. And how could he have kept such a lofty position without a few tricks up his sleeve, hmm?"Ayato himself is unfazed by such comments."Well, I consider myself merely a serious, dutiful public servant who owes his allegiance to the Almighty Shogun."Character Story 1 Friendship Lv. 2
Kamisato Ayato, as the eldest son of Inazuman nobility, was greatly loved from the moment he was born.Though his parents were too busy to always spend time with him, they took good care of him, and in any case the "young master" never lacked for people around to look after his every need.When he was somewhat older, he would, at his father's request, begin a complex and strict training regimen as the family successor.But not all went as well as they might have hoped, and the pressures in the court and at home would weigh heavily on his father's health, resulting in an early passing.The young Ayato was thus thrust into a battle for the survival of the clan's position.In those days, none were impressed by this inexperienced youngster. Ayato went from being an elegant and refined princeling to "the poor young master of the Kamisato Clan" amongst the people, and "that greenhorn" amongst his political opponents.Time, however, would prove these people wrong.With extraordinary courage and some first-rate tactics, he did not leave the clan to languish. No, indeed, the Kamisato Clan's position would grow more stable than ever.The heavy workload, malicious deceptions, and attempts to frame him at every turn he parried away, even turning them to his own advantage.The passage of time has only increased the standing of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan in the Shogunate and with the people.Today, Ayato is a clan head that a great house like the Kamisato Clan would be proud of, and a Yashiro Commissioner acknowledged by all.Character Story 2 Friendship Lv. 3
The Yashiro Commission is in charge of ritual matters on Narukami Island, and must also attend to matters of cultural leisure in such a manner that deities and the people alike are pleased — and they do, honoring their commission.But with greater responsibilities come greater amounts of work.Fortunately, his sister Ayaka shares much of the clan's responsibilities, with most of the interactions between the Commission and the people falling to her, allowing Ayato to spend most of his time on matters of governance.Dealing with Shogunate officials is no easy matter. People come from different Commissions and clans, and their perspectives are very different. Any single task grows harder as the number of people involved grows.Ayato's great strength lies in his ability to handle such matters. The way he sees it, people are driven by interest. Find leverage, and the other side will cooperate.Find some goal that will bring the other party around to your logic, then pacify them with a few choice platitudes for the occasion, and most problems can be resolved.And when dealing with the stubborn, one merely needs to appeal to a higher power to bear — after all, what mortal could gainsay the light of heaven itself, no matter how high their status or arrogant their attitude?Over time, the knowledgeable and decorous Kamisato clan head gained quite the name for himself in the Shogunate."Hmm... this matter seems quite hard to handle. Should we ask the Yashiro Commissioner?"So people would often say.However, while Ayato is indeed full of ways and means, he will not simply help at any given moment.Firstly, not every task is related to the Yashiro Commission. Secondly, it is simply not worth it for the Kamisato Clan to get itself involved for the sake of others' petty profit.Mostly, Ayato will simply tag along as a junior figure, teacup in hand, doing little more than smiling."Ah, come now, Sir Nagaoka. We are all loyal servants of the Almighty Shogun. Nothing more to it. We just need to be open with each other, and I'm sure we can resolve this issue together."Character Story 3 Friendship Lv. 4
Being limited by his station and work, Ayato does not often appear in public, nor does he have much time for any sort of leisurely walk. However, these obstacles cannot hinder him from learning of new and interesting things.Perhaps in the morning, he might spy one of the Yae Publishing House staff poking her head around the place, seemingly here to "report for work." In which case, he may as well pretend not to notice, all the better to hear what new methods she has for skipping work... and then "accidentally" let slip his newfound knowledge to Guuji Yae.In a meeting with those old fogeys at Tenshukaku, there is no need to speak too quickly. After all, watching grown people argue till they are red in the face over petty issues is quite amusing.While walking through the streets, he might suddenly consider a certain unique snack stand. Going up to the owner, he'd ask if they are selling anything new, how business is going, buy a drink or two to try... and if he finds it interesting, he'll buy a few back for the rest of the household.Lately, he also lent some encouragement to the young oni who frequents Hanamizaka due to the latter's bug-fighting troubles — out of the goodness of his heart, of course. He also discovered that this crimson oni did not know what the name "Ayato" signified... which was fine, of course. No need to explain such things.On the way home, he might pass Chinju Forest and see passers-by having tricks played on them by the bake-danuki, in which case he will point the illusion out. If the bake-danuki should hone their changeling skills further on his account, why, they should thank him for the inspiration.And of course, even one so talented as Thoma might sometimes struggle to think of what to make for dinner. Such occasions are perfect for a hot pot game! After all, Ayaka always puts the most unexpected things into the pot — and how proud he is of his sister for that!Yes, these things are indeed the spice of the Yashiro Commissioner's life.Character Story 4 Friendship Lv. 5
Between the butler and the housekeeper, the Kamisato estate is always spick and span, inside and out... except for one location.Kamisato Ayato's table is always a terrible mess after he uses it.Books are strewn about, open and even dumped face-down on the table, while documents of uneven size are stacked haphazardly. The ink on the inkstone is never really properly kept, and one might even sometimes find chess pieces or cards under the table.Each time the clan head gets off work, the servants always need some time to clean his study up.In the process, they discovered that assorted notes are often clipped between these pages. Upon closer inspection, they are written in different hands, and their content also varies."Clan Head, the servants have sent a new batch of flowers. I have placed them in a flower vase in a corner of the table. Please take care not to knock it over again.""Clan Head, a shrine maiden from the Grand Narukami Shrine came over today, saying that the Lady Guuji wishes to see you. It seems important, as it involves the requisitioning of land in Ritou. She invites you to the Shrine to discuss the details.""Lord Commissioner, the Momoyo flowers have not withered. The branches grow yet. Do not worry.""Dear Brother, I learned a new recipe while attending festivities with the Traveler. Considering that (‍heheText for Aether/shesheText for Lumine‍) is from another land, do you think... that I might need to make some changes to said recipe?""Clan Head, the servants have been reluctant to tell you this, so allow this old lady to say it. If you wish to eat something, please leave it to our housekeeper. Also, please refrain from using the ingredients in the kitchen... How could we make you cook for yourself, after all?"Ayato's work often sees him leaving home early and returning late. As such, the people of the Kamisato Estate will communicate with him through these means.This was a method that Ayato came up with himself, and this is how the Kamisato household is run, via these small notes.Unfortunately, their use has seen the clan head's already messy table become messier still... Oh well, just a small sacrifice. Nothing worth writing home about.Character Story 5 Friendship Lv. 6
In Inazuma, people will sometimes pray to deities by offering certain kinds of cypress leaves.But as such rituals lack scale, they are often forgotten amidst the many, both large and small, that are conducted throughout the land.Though some time has passed, Ayato still remembers his mother mentioning that though these cypresses are evergreen, their leaves are not needle-like.Instead, they have large, crisp leaves that will not wither and fall even when new ones grow.As such, it is associated with the concept of "prosperity," and was often used in ancient times as ritual plating for food offerings.Today, people no longer use leaves as mats upon which to spread food, but the habit of offering cypress leaves persists nonetheless.Perhaps it was just a hobby of hers, or perhaps she was just well-read in general, but whatever the case, his mother always had a great deal to say about festival affairs."Perhaps the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission were born to protect the deities."In his younger years, Ayato had not fully agreed with this statement.He believed that the Kamisato Clan was the Kamisato Clan, and that it belonged to the family's members. That was the reason for its existence, and any service to the gods was a job, a matter of circumstance.But such presumptuous words could never be said out loud, and in any case, Ayato could not bear to interrupt his mother when she looked so excited.No matter how long she would go on, Ayato would always sit in front of her and listen in silence, even if his legs might fall asleep in the process.With the passing of years, Ayato's days would be taken up by swordsmanship and books. The one giving the "lessons" was now his father, and the lesson content would turn from ritual affairs to matters that the clan's successor should be concerned with.His duty to the clan would be something that would occupy yet more space in Ayato's life. Nor was the Raiden Shogun just a mere symbol as she was in his childhood. Now, she was the Ogosho, the mighty defender of Inazuma's eternal peace."The Kamisato Clan stands today because of Narukami's mercy. As such, the Clan must defend the road to Eternity, and follow the Shogun eternally.""This was our agreement, and it is the unchanging rule of our clan. Remember this well."As for the specifics of what happened, Ayato had already gleaned some of them from reading their ancestral teachings. It was the Kamisato elders' failings that had resulted in the nationally-important Raiden Gokaden to suffer great loss. If not for Guuji Yae's intervention on their behalf, causing the Shogun to show them mercy, the Kamisato Clan may have joined others in falling from grace and ceasing to exist.This was the grace of Her Excellency, and at the same time, it was a warning from Her servant.As such, Ayato never snubbed his father's teachings. Though he still believed in protecting his clan above all else, he also understood that Inazuma was sustained by the Electro Archon's protection. Only peace in Inazuma could guarantee the longevity and prosperity of the clan.No matter how things might change in Inazuma, the Kamisato Clan alone would never betray the Almighty Narukami.Even if his heart said differently, he could only bury it deep beneath well-maintained appearances.Just as his mother said back then—"The divinely-protected cypress will sprout new leaves from ancient branches.So, too, can the camellia in the courtyard remain fragrant even in the most bitter winter."Yumemiru Pen Case Friendship Lv. 4
Even Kamisato Ayato himself could not have expected that calligraphy practice, which he had found most boring in his youth, would eventually become a favored pastime of his.He had slogged through much penmanship practice to better play the part of the Kamisato Clan's eldest son.But nowadays, he transcribes a few poems from time to time to clear his mind and think in silence.Of course, this also lets him seem like he is busy with official business even while idle, all the better to avoid seeing some people and doing certain things.With time's passing, it became agreed among the servants waiting on him that he not only liked to play chess but was also fond of calligraphy.Such talk would spread widely via word of mouth. As such, Ayato often receives excellent brushes as gifts during festivals or birthdays.Some of the more speculative have even bought him exquisite and expensive quill pens from overseas.Ayato has never attempted to clarify this matter, but instead had a lovely wooden case made in which he stores such stationery.He has always been interested in all things new, and trying out these new pens is indeed fun.Moreover, these gifts often say much about the person who sent them. Such information thus becomes one of the means by which Ayato can get a handle on them.That said, though he claims to have bought this case to store stationery, there are three pens that Ayato has never placed inside it.One of them, slim and well-crafted, is placed on his desk. It shows signs of some wear and tear, but it writes well, and is used for writing petitions.The second is stored in a drawer at the bottom, its fine tip having seen much loving use in the past when Ayato was practicing calligraphy. Its beginner-friendly nature also saw it borrowed quite often by Thoma and Ayaka back in the day.As for the third, it is stored deep within a wooden cabinet used to store antiques, sealed within a silk bag. Excellent of make and design, it was presented to him by his mother during his adulthood ceremony.Vision Friendship Lv. 6
One night, many years ago, Ayato's gravely-ill father summoned him into his presence.That night, his father seemed a little different from the illness-weathered figure he had become. His expression was solemn, and yet the concern in his eyes was all too clear.Forcing himself to stay alert, he asked Ayato: was his training done? Had he eaten enough for dinner? How was his swordsmanship progressing?As Ayato replied, his father nodded with a smile, seemingly satisfied. Yet, his expression would quickly darken, as if there was something he wanted to, but could not say.After much hesitation, and under his wife's melancholic gaze, his father would finally speak, his voice heavy:"Ayato... Remember, no matter what happens to the Kamisato Clan in the future, you are our eldest son, Ayaka's elder brother... A successor the Kamisato Clan is proud to have."After reminding his father to rest well, Ayato would take leave of his parents and return to his bedroom.The moment he opened the door, he saw the shining Vision lying on his desk.Ayato had heard since he was young that Visions are signs of the gods' favor, born of human wishes.Since his youth, he had longed to become the family's pillar, not for any great work, but to ensure that the clan would prosper, and to protect them.That this Vision should appear now... meant that, perhaps, the time had come for him to take up this burden.So thinking, Ayato did not call for the servants to light the lamps. Instead, he merely sat down beside the table.Many things flowed through his mind then like a tide:His father was gravely ill, and his mother was also unwell. The clan was leaderless, and its competitors eyed its position and power hungrily, as they had for some time now.His sister was still young, and he had to ensure that she grew up safely. The Shogunate courts were like a sea full of hidden reefs. One had to tread most carefully there...They could not let go of the Shuumatsuban, command over which had passed down through the family for generations. As for the servants, some few might still be trusted should the Kamisato Clan's strength wane...And as for Thoma, who had come from a different land, though he was a friend and useful ally both, would he consider other options should the Kamisato Clan truly fall?These scattered thoughts would gradually straighten themselves out in Ayato's mind, and at their center was his still-unchanged conviction—He would use any means at his disposal to secure the safety of his family and its future. Obstacles to that goal would be cleared away, no matter the cost.That night, the Vision was the only light that accompanied him.And when the first light of the next dawn alighted upon the desk, the young heir was already prepared to face the world.

Kamisato (Japanese: 神里) means "god's village", while Ayato (Japanese: 綾人) means "mature man", lit. "twill human". Kamisato can also be more broadly translated to mean "god's origin", which is similar to the word Genshin (Japanese: 原神) meaning "original god" or "origins of god".
Ayato's constellation represents either a cypress or a type of oak. This ambiguity comes from the Chinese character "柏" (Chinese: bǎi; Japanese: kashiwa), which represents a cypress in Chinese but refers to a specific type of oak tree in Japanese. In both cases, these trees are regarded as sacred trees in Shinto that symbolize eternity, which is Inazuma's ideal.
It may refer to the hinoki trees in Japan, a type of cypress there known for its strength and resistance. Because of its durability, it is often used as wood materials for Shinto shrines. A scholar says the language of flowers associated with hinoki in the Japanese culture is "immortality" and "undying."[5]
Ayato's constellation in the original Chinese version, 神守柏座, means "Divine Guardian Cypress Constellation." Similarly, it is translated as "Cypressus Custos" in the English localization, which is Latin for "Guardian Cypress."
Alternatively, it may refer to the kashiwa oak trees (sometimes known as the daimyou oak in English). Being a large evergreen tree, it is often used as a symbol of longevity, from the family crests of priests and samurai to the traditional confectionary kashiwa mochi.
Due to the aforementioned difference in meaning of 柏, while the Japanese localization uses the same characters as the Chinese version, 神守柏座 instead means the "Divine Guardian Kashiwa Constellation" in Japanese.
Furthermore, the Japanese version of his title, Pillar of Fortitude (Japanese: 磐祭葉守 Bansai Hamori), roughly translates to "Hamori of Adamantine Ritual." Hamori ("Leaf-Guardian") is the name of the god of leaves in Shinto, who is said to reside in kashiwa oak trees.

After that, she would start focusing intensely every time she heard the sound of thunder, as if by concentrating hard enough, she'd be able to hear exactly what Her Excellency was saying.
When It SnowsWhen It SnowsMedia:VO_Kamisato Ayato When It Snows.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kamisato_Ayato_When_It_Snows.ogg This view reminds me of another time it snowed... that was a long time ago.

A little sword practice while the day is young is good for the body and mind. I tend to avoid having anything scheduled during these hours... What do you say? Fancy crossing blades with me?

Whatever method you use, the important thing is that it delivers acceptable results.

Most entertaining... It takes a special kind of person to get old man Kujou riled up enough to start tearing his hair out. Ahh... Oh, to have been a fly on the wall.

Also, I like to think it's happiest in my possession because it has the chance to shine away in all its glory.

Mm, yes, I'm definitely more of a dog person myself. Cats are very independent, which has its merits, but you'll only find obedience in dogs. They'll do whatever you tell them to. Hehe, what can I say — I suppose I find loyalty to be quite an attractive quality.

But I want her to be able to hold on to her innocence. She shouldn't have to get personally involved in power struggles, or confront the darker side of life head-on. As her older brother, it's my job to shield her from all of that... Heh, just... between the two of us, of course. Sorry, that got a little more private a little more quickly than I'd intended.
About Thoma Friendship Lv. 4About Thoma Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Kamisato Ayato About Thoma.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kamisato_Ayato_About_Thoma.ogg There is no doubt in my mind about Thoma's loyalty to the Kamisato Clan. A long time ago, partly to see where he stood, I advised him that he would be better off leaving if he didn't want to get drawn into the never-ending disputes that plague public life. Still, he chose to stay, and in all the time he's been with us, he's spared me much worry. There are very few people I trust completely these days, but Thoma is one of them.

Yes, a most... spirited young lady. The Kamisato Clan is on rather close terms with her. She is around the same age as Ayaka, and the two get along very well. I trust her direct and outspoken disposition won't lead Ayaka astray. Ayaka has always been staunchly true to herself, ever since she was a young child.

These wounds will take time to heal, and as someone with a mediating role to play in the political process, I will be sure to fulfill that which is required of me.
About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4Media:VO_Kamisato Ayato About Yae Miko.ogghttps://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:VO_Kamisato_Ayato_About_Yae_Miko.ogg Lady Guuji has been kind to us in the Kamisato Clan, but she has never quite taken to me personally. I trust you'll have heard the way she refers to me... "the Yashiro rascal" and other such flattering monikers. We run into each other semi-regularly, given the overlap in our work, and despite whatever private thoughts we each may have, our working relationship is quite a harmonious one. I have no great objection to this state of affairs — working with intelligent people always makes things highly efficient. In any case... However objectionable she might find me, she would be forced to admit that without me, she would have no one to help execute her weird and wonderful ideas.

The only flaw in his plan being, he is now no longer able to wield the weapon of his creation.

My forebears may have failed to save his family from decline, but even today I have a duty to support him. Now, naturally, there is nothing I can do to restore his clan's former fortunes. But as for helping him avoid arrest by the Tenryou Commission, that is well within my capabilities...

Pitting docile Onikabuto against each other in battle... heh, that's a first... I was only speaking in polite platitudes when I gave him that little pep talk, but to my surprise he started calling me "bro"... To this day, he calls me "my bro Ayato" without the faintest idea of my true identity. It's quite alright by me, though, I have nothing against his... unique character.

You seem to misunderstand me. Let me be quite clear: Most of the time, I simply enjoy watching people's facial contortions when they're put in an awkward position. Watching them squirm, you might say. Is that so strange? I would have thought you tease your little friend here on a regular basis for precisely that purpose, no?

There is no pleasure to be had in mixing with the powers that be. I shall spare you the details. Just know that... I have never done anything to dishonor the Kamisato Clan. Neither in the past, when I was working to bring stability to our clan, nor here in the present, where I am working for the sake of all of Inazuma.

I suppose there's no harm in divulging a detail or two to you. It's a secret unit that reports directly to the head of the Kamisato Clan. Accordingly, after my father passed, it came to me. There are certain situations I cannot directly involve myself in, and in these cases, being able to rely on the Shuumatsuban is often instrumental in achieving a resolution. Most of its members are orphans whom we take in and raise from a young age. This way, loyalty is guaranteed to the greatest extent possible, and we are spared a great deal of worry.

Well, naturally. If even the cunning bunny burrows thrice, then what of the cunning human? But anyway, I've shared enough of my secrets. I think it's time I heard your story. Oh, and... you can spare the part about traveling in Teyvat. Tell me about before that.

Dialogue

Media:vo ayato mimitomo hello 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Hello, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo ayato mimitomo hello 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Good timing. I have a job that needs doing, and you are the only one who can do it.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo hello 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: ...Hehe, just wanted to see how you'd react.
 Are you settling in okay?
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Most definitely.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I have seen furnishings like these plenty of times before, though I don't believe I've seen them arranged in this particular fashion.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: The layout is clearly inspired and thoroughly distinctive... Simply marvelous.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg Kamisato Ayato: In fact, I'm inclined to have the Yashiro Commission headquarters remodeled in this style.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Would you object to overseeing the project and making sure everything is to the right specifications?
 I feel like you're probably joking...?
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship1 06a.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Ah, what gave it away? My acting skills appear to have deteriorated.
 Uh... I don't think that's a good idea.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship1 06b 1.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Heh, why the pained expression?
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship1 06b 2.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Well, if it's really that much trouble, I won't force it.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship1 07.ogg Kamisato Ayato: In any case, this place is refreshingly different.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship1 08.ogg Kamisato Ayato: You may find me visiting you here quite often.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)
 Would you like to have a chat with me?
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: If you wish to chat, then by all means, let's chat. What's on your mind?
 How's work in the Yashiro Commission?
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 02a 1.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I had thought you'd be inquiring about more personal matters.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 02a 2.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Heh, you don't need to worry about me being overworked.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 02a 3.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Case in point — I still have the energy to chat with you here.
 But don't you find the work draining?
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 02a 4a 1.ogg Kamisato Ayato: People tend to find work draining if they haven't yet discovered what they are trying to protect.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 02a 4a 2.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I, at least, don't have this problem.
 Well, hats off to you.
 But don't you think there's too much to do?
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 02a 4b 1.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Oh, you mean my workload? Yes, it's rather enormous. But there's nothing that can be done about that.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 02a 4b 2.ogg Kamisato Ayato: All I can do is try to work through each item as intelligently as possible.
 Well, hats off to you.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 02a 5.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I am flattered beyond belief to receive your praise and concern for my well-being.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 02a 6.ogg Kamisato Ayato: But you needn't worry. At present, there is no one more suitable than I to be in the position of Yashiro Commissioner.
 How's life in the Yashiro Commission?
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 2b 1.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Life? ...Once work is accounted for, precious little time remains to allocate to my personal life.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 2b 2.ogg Kamisato Ayato: If this is something that concerns you, I see a simple solution: you can be my valet.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 2b 3.ogg Kamisato Ayato: My diet and other day-to-day needs will be your responsibility.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 2b 4.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Oh... as far as diet is concerned, I'm not a picky eater. And as for everything else... No, actually I don't think I have any peculiar habits that you need to be aware of.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 2b 5.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Though if you ever discover anything that tastes new and different, bring some back for me too.
 For example, strange new dishes?
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 2b 6a.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Hmm... yes, why not. Worth a try.
 ...Oh, you're actually being serious this time.
 For example, new kinds of milk tea?
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 2b 6b.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Precisely. I'm looking forward to it already.
 ...Oh, you're actually being serious this time.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 2b 7.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Indeed, I am.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship2 2b 8.ogg Kamisato Ayato: It's entirely up to you. Take your time and give it some thought. Consider it an ongoing discussion.
(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
 Anything you want to do?
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Have you ever taken a dog for a walk, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 ...Taken a dog for a walk?
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Yes. Where you stroll together with a canine companion.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Dogs are instinctually loyal. But no matter how well-behaved a dog might be, it gets unhappy if it's cooped up in the same place for too long.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Bringing it outdoors and watching it run free and enjoy itself is a splendid way to relax. It puts you in a good mood.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Don't you want to try?
 I'm a little nervous...
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship3 06a 1.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Don't worry. My staff will be sure to pick out a sufficiently docile dog for you.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship3 06a 2.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Failing that... There's always Taroumaru.
 Alright, I guess I can give it a try.
 Sure!
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship3 06b.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Heh, raring to go, I see.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Alright then. If you have any reservations starting out, we can treat this as a practice area.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship3 08.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Once you've reached the point where you're able to enjoy it, we can head out onto the streets.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Drinking some milk tea and walking the dogs... I wouldn't be surprised if it causes some commotion.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Heh, not that I mind, of course.
(Between 6:00 and 19:00)
 Good morning, Ayato.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo morning 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Good morning, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo ayato mimitomo morning 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Shall we have breakfast together? I'll have my staff prepare something.
(Between 19:00 and 6:00)
 Goodnight, Ayato.
Media:vo ayato mimitomo night 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Good night, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Media:vo ayato mimitomo night 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Relax and sleep well. Nobody would dare disturb you.

Special Dialogue
When a character is invited to or invites themselves to their favorite set for the first time, the character will provide a reward. They will provide a reward for each of their favorite sets.

Court of the Upright

Media:vo mimitomo dq ayato courtyard 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: This is a truly exceptional design. The architectural style borrows from the Tri-Commission mansions, and the general arrangement is very aesthetically pleasing.
Media:vo mimitomo dq ayato courtyard 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: The familiar environment makes me feel right at home, and good company only adds to the exquisiteness of the occasion.
Media:vo mimitomo dq ayato courtyard 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Hmm, truly delightful.

Summer Night's Recollection

Media:vo mimitomo dq ayato fiesta 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Ah... this reminds me of when Ayaka was young, and we would visit the festival together...
Media:vo mimitomo dq ayato fiesta 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: It's immaculate. Even I, as Yashiro Commissioner, cannot find any fault with the way you have designed this place.
Media:vo mimitomo dq ayato fiesta 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Since it's just the two of us here... shall we take a stroll together?
