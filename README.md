==== unfinished programs 

"magic chaos" is a wild magic generator. The logic changes a ton based off effects. (journal NYI, but I will make a changelog as I develop it further)

"Wild magic dictionary" is a bunch of reference dictionaries and arrays to make "magic chaos" work.
Statistics and balance will be found here.

==== functional programs

file "chaos bolt" is Rules-as-written, automating the 1d8 table.
This makes multiple chains very unlikely.

file "custom chaos bolt" makes a flat 1/3 chance (instead of 1/8) for chained damage or effects, adding variation to tactics because you can declare a debuff or straight damage
(descriptions explain how backfires work and give a better feel of "more power = more danger" as an embodiment of chaos)

file "rand polymorph" is for testing the randomized polymorph dictionary. This is a set of CR1 appropriate monsters as an attempt at stat balance. 
NOTE: The dictionary is ordered from useless to powerful, but not broken. A Giant Spider is overly strong for a lvl1 spell, but it balances out, given that you, or an enemy, could turn either into that or a slug.
[probably should be play-tested as it's own variation lvl-1 spell slot, bonus-action cast, like a sorcerer not having control to contrast from a druid's discipline]

8 july: 
[!] make journal for magic chaos
[!] polymorph dictionary added, and effect of random polymorph added (needs testing)
    - to-do [confirm polymorph randomization gets the data from the dictionary correctly]
chaos bolt works with several random effects, confirmed for straight damage and damage + effect, balanced based on effect type
Damage type randomized fairly
1/8 chance for declared damage or effect cast to be inverted 


7 july: working on DnD tools for calculating random wild-magic effects and automatically rolling to resolve outcomes.
