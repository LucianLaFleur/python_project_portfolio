Chinese and Japanese both have quality voice acting, but cannot easily be mimiced with AI examples.
I suggest possibly making another scraper to find Hanzi/Kanji usage relating to voice overs, specifically
as an example url: https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ganyu/Voice-Overs/Chinese
The above notion is irrelevant to German, which has no voice acting. Different resources must be investigated for audio samples from discovered/variant sentences
