Dialogue[]

Yikuo: Hello? Can I help?
 Shouldn't you be at work now?
Yikuo: How dare you. I'm taking a brief moment of much-needed respite from a very hectic schedule, that's all.
Yikuo: Hardly my fault if you didn't see me while I was hard at work just now, is it?
 Well, you do have a point.
Yikuo: Exactly, right? Life is brutish and short. Working hard every day is fine and all, but is it worth it?
Yikuo: Rather than sacrifice everything on the altar of work like my colleagues, isn't it better to take breaks like this?
Yikuo: Life is long, why the rush and the chase?
Yikuo: So you should relax, too. Sit here, take a break, have some tea, try these Fried Radish Balls... enjoy life rather than suffer it.
(Obtain  Fried Radish Balls ×4)
 Goodbye.
Yikuo: Bye. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail!
Yikuo: Oh, also — don't tell Sarge I'm here, if you do see him.
