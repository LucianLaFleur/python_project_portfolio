Profile[]
Rana is a Forest Ranger who helps guide travelers to Sumeru City or Port Ormos along with maintaining the forest's ecosystem in check.
She met the Traveler and Paimon when she was attacked by some fungi and quickly befriended them, witnessing the Traveler's combat prowess as they eliminated plenty of monsters and Withering Zones alike. After finishing up some of her duties, when they tried to return to Vimara Village, they saw Iotham running into a cave and followed him, where they found him in another Withering Zone surrounded by monsters. Without regard to her safety, she charged in to save him; however, the short exposure to the zone caused her to become ill.
Arana, who had bubbled Iotham, saw the sick Rana and bubbled her up too for her own safety. The Traveler discovered Arana when they returned to retrieve Rana, who told them that she needed Bija to be purged of Marana's corruption. After going on a lengthy adventure where they met and befriended the Aranara, the Traveler finally obtained the Bija. Giving it to Rana, she woke up from her coma and met Arana, who she had befriended in her youth and was upset she forgot about it. As they re-befriended each other, a Dendro Vision appeared on her waist, showing that she had been recognized by the gods.
With her newly acquired Vision, Rana decided to go on a journey with Arana, thanking the Traveler and hoping that they would meet again in the future.
