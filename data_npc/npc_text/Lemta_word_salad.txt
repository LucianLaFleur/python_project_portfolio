Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Avena: I think I'll go explore over there next!
Lemta: Miss, with all due respect, your adventure plan...
Avena: Yeah, I know. I haven't forgotten! I just want to buy some Sumeru specialties before I set off.
Avena: Come shop with me first, and I'll pay you by the standard of an Adventurer's bodyguard. You won't be underpaid. Trust me.
Lemta: It's not the money. I don't usually carry packages for clients in the downtown area...
Avena: Well, I wasn't fully prepared for this. I came to Sumeru with only diving equipment. Just see this as procuring supplies for my adventure.
Lemta: Fine then...

Nighttime[]

Hakan: Ah! If it isn't Lemta! The last time I saw you in the city... Um... Well, I believe I've never seen you in the city before.
Lemta: Yeah. I came this time with an adventurer who paid me to protect her.
Lemta: My original plan was to leave after we've registered at the Adventurers' Guild, but she became obsessed with shopping halfway...
Lemta: I've spent days with her in the Grand Bazaar... And I have a feeling that this isn't gonna end soon.
Hakan: Wow, you're not exaggerating, are you?
Lemta: Nope. I guess it has to do with her being a foreigner, so anything here could pique her interest easily. Every day, she shops until the sun sets. And as her bodyguard, I can't leave her alone.
Hakan: Wow, that sounds terrible. You've never been a fan of the fancy stuff at the market. I guess you must be so bored right now.
Hakan: Why don't you quit the job and join the Corps of Thirty?
Hakan: We only work for the Akademiya. It's a stable job with much to earn and not so much to be done. This is far better than taking gigs in small gangs.
Lemta: I'll pass. The fact that even you are saying there's "not much to be done" means only one thing: What the job involves is eating, drinking, sleeping, and nothing more.
Hakan: Haha! You sure know me very well.
