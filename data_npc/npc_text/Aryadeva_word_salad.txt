Media:VO Aryadeva All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Aryadeva: (My manuscript got rejected again... Those editors at Yae Publishing House are really strict...)

Dialogue[]

Aryadeva: Hello, I'm planning to set up a Light Novel Society. Are you interested?
 A Light Novel Society?
Aryadeva: There are many societies in the Akademiya, but no Light Novel Society. It's strange, isn't it?
Aryadeva: Light novels don't seem popular in Sumeru, but it is the Nation of Wisdom after all. There shouldn't be any gaps in our fields of knowledge.
Aryadeva: I am not exactly a researcher of the Akademiya, but I am second to none when it comes to light novels.
Aryadeva: Should we have an initiation ceremony or something like that?
 Who are you...
Aryadeva: I haven't studied in the Akademiya, but I'd like to consider myself a Herbad in the field of light novels.
Aryadeva: However, there is no school in the Akademiya that awards diplomas in light novels.
Aryadeva: That's why it's pertinent to have my book published by Yae Publishing House. My book's title is "Can a Trainee Combat Mage Whose Normal Attack Summons a Jinni that Will Start a Full-Out Free-For-All Really Graduate From the Magic Akademiya?"
Aryadeva: I didn't expect my manuscript to be rejected again. Those Yae Publishing House editors are really strict...
 About the Kory Drums...
(Unlocks after completing Khvarena of Good and Evil)
Aryadeva: How did you hear about the Kory Drums? Did the Adventurers' Guild tell you?
 We're adventurers that specialize in solving particular problems.
Aryadeva: Oh, well that's good to hear. If that's the case, there's a burden off my chest.
Aryadeva: You should have already seen that fool child Nasejuna, yes? The fact that you're standing here means that his plot failed.
Aryadeva: Before, when Nasejuna asked me about the Kory Drums, I knew he was up to no good.
Aryadeva: Hence, I deliberately hid the fact that I had one of the Kory Drums and entrusted it to an acquaintance I have in the Akademiya...
Aryadeva: The glory days of the Order of Skeptics are bygone legends by now. Rather than harboring their dangerous delusions, its [sic] better to see their desires manifest in light novels instead.
 Please excuse me now...
Aryadeva: If you want to join the society, just let me know.
