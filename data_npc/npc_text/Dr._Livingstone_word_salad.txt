Dr. Livingstone: Hmm? Pardon me, I was lost in thought.
 Tell me about the Sword Cemetery...
Dr. Livingstone: What the... You've broken the three seals!?
Dr. Livingstone: Then... Does that mean you've defeated all three hilichurl tribes too?
 Sure does.
Dr. Livingstone: Wow. Such an appetite for action... Such boundless wisdom... Such great strength... I didn't know both of us were adventurers!
Dr. Livingstone: Thank you for succeeding where I did not. But I am going to stay here.
Dr. Livingstone: There are still many mysteries to be solved at this Sword Cemetery.
Dr. Livingstone: As adventurers, it is our duty to unearth ancient secrets. So I shall continue to investigate here!
 Goodbye.
Dr. Livingstone: Be careful!
 Are you an adventurer?
Dr. Livingstone: I certainly am, though I would be the first to admit that my appearance is more that of a scholar... Nevertheless, my principle occupation is indeed adventuring.
Dr. Livingstone: I have taken a few notes from my recent studies of the Sword Cemetery. Hope you find them useful.
Dr. Livingstone: We adventurers have to look out for each other. Ad astra abyssosque!
