Dialogue[]

Owada: When will today end... Ack, you scared me!
Owada: Are... are you here to report something?
 Who are you?
Owada I'm the Yoriki of the Police Station, the superior of every Doushin here. Just call me Owada.
Owada The Police Station is in charge of keeping order and peace. If you see anything out of order, you can come here and report it to us...
Owada That being said, I still hope that nothing comes up. May the Electro Archon bless us all.
 Do you get a lot of reports?
Owada: Shush! Stop saying that word. If there were indeed reports every day, do you think we could handle it?
Owada: I'm getting too old for this. I only wish to clock out on time daily and retire peacefully...
Owada: Don't get the wrong idea. I'm not slacking off. I have been in this line of work for far too long and have seen everything. I just want the world to be peaceful so that everyone can live happily in peace. Wouldn't that be great?
Owada The less crime we have, the better... And if it's a case about losing your pet, please visit Ryuuji at the detective agency for help.
 Ryuuji?
Owada Ryuuji is from the Bantan Sango Detective Agency, and he's an old acquaintance of mine.
Owada Back when he was the victim of a frame job, I wanted to do something, but sadly, my power was limited...
Owada Luckily, he met the president of that detective agency, who helped to clear his name.
Owada Anyway, it's best that we don't see another case like that one... or any cases at all. Yeah.
 Goodbye.
Owada: Goodbye. Stay safe.
