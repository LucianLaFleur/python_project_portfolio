Dialogue[]
First Interaction[]

(Talk to Takashi for the first time, without trying to open the chests)
Takashi: Hmm? Are you a traveler? Haha, you've come at a good time. I have some good news for you.
 Does it involve these treasure chests?
Takashi: That's right, it's the treasure chests.
Takashi: They're filled with all kinds of treasures, carefully gathered by me.
Takashi: For just a little something in return, you can open the chests and get your hands on the treasures inside.
 You want Mora?
Takashi: Hahaha, actually, I don't want any Mora.
 What would you like, then?
Takashi: What I want is a kind of conch.
Takashi: You should be able to find plenty of them around the beach.
Takashi: If you want to open the treasure chests and get your hands on what's inside, bring me some of those conches in exchange.
Takashi: But... I'm not going to tell you what's inside. What treasures you end up with will come down to how lucky you are.
Takashi: What do you think? If you want to open these treasure chests, just hand me some conches.
(Upon trying to open the chests without interacting with Takashi first)
Takashi: Whoa there, wait a second. You can't just open these chests as you please.
 Are these your chests?
Takashi: Of course. I placed them here specifically.
 What's inside?
Takashi: They're filled with all kinds of treasures, carefully gathered by me.
Takashi: If you want to open them, that can be arranged... However, first, you have to give me something in exchange.
 You want Mora?
(Same as above)
 What would you like, then?
(Same as above)

(Talk to Takashi again)
Takashi: How's it going? Have you got some conches for me?
(Give Mysterious Conch ×3)
Takashi: Nice one! These are just the kind of conches I wanted. Go ahead, pick a treasure chest and open it.
 ...Only one chest?
 Can't I open all of them?
Takashi: Sorry, these chests are one at a time, I'm afraid.
Takashi: Okay, go ahead and take your pick. Best of luck, hehe.
(Talk to Takashi again without opening any chest)
Takashi: Go pick a treasure chest and open it. I wish you the best of luck.

(After opening a chest and approaching Takashi again)
Takashi: I take it you've opened one of the chests? Hahaha, I hope you got lucky.
 So you're collecting these conches?
Takashi: Bingo. Yes, I am collecting them.
Takashi: But I can't tell you why for now.
 Is there something special about them?
Takashi: From a business point of view, there most certainly is.
Takashi: "Conches that were once influenced by Tatarigami"... Hahaha, they're sure to fetch a good price!
Takashi: Ahem! Anyway, you provide me with conches, I provide you with chests. Got it?
 You're so suspicious...
Takashi: They're just conches for goodness' sake. Don't be so paranoid.
Takashi: Anyway, that's your opportunity this time around used up.
Takashi: If you want to open another treasure chest, come back with some more conches later on.
Normal Dialogue[]
Takashi: Hmm? Is something the matter?
 I want to open a chest. (Only available if a chest has not been opened that day)
Takashi: As long as you've got some conches for me, you're free to take your pick.
 What are you collecting these conches for?
Takashi: Hehehe, well... to do some business, of course.
Takashi: "Conches that were once influenced by Tatarigami"... Hahaha, they're sure to fetch a good price!
Takashi: Ahem! Anyway, you provide me with conches, I provide you with chests. Got it?
 This house looks familiar...
Takashi: Is that so? Wow...that's [sic] quite a coincidence, hahaha.
Takashi: But even if the house looks the same, the business I do here is unique.
 Goodbye.
Takashi: Bye for now, then. Don't forget: conches for chests, conches for chests, hahaha.

Trivia[]
The Traveler can remark "This house looks familiar," and indeed, Takashi's house is similar to the one Granny Chu is found in near Yaoguang Shoal, Liyue.
The Inazuma Treasure Compass picks up the three Chests in Takashi's hut (every day, after server reset) regardless if the player has already obtained the weapon blueprint.
