Sevigne's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Sevigne, alongside fellow Junior Researchers Chisseray, Genevieve, and Maillardet, were Bossuet's assistants at the Fontaine Research Institute (which, under Bossuet's reign, was renamed to the "Bossuet Research Institute"). In one of the Institute's records pertaining to the team's accomplishments, Sevigne left a comment complaining about Maillardet's fascination with the "weird dancing toys," which earned her a reprimand from Chisseray. Out of all the members of Bossuet's team, Sevigne was the only one to continue her research at the lab underneath Mary-Ann Memorial Park,[1] even after most of the buildings were destroyed by Edwin Eastinghouse's explosion.[2]
Over the course of Treacherous Light of the Depths, the Traveler and Paimon successfully calibrate the light-based mechanisms she used to keep visitors out and make their way to Maillardet's prototype Meka, which she was using to guard her room. After reactivating and subsequently defeating them, Sevigne emerges from her room to investigate the commotion and, although amused that the Traveler defeated the prototypes so easily, makes them recover three Punched Tapes and deliver them to Chisseray, alongside a request for manpower to take away the prototype Meka.

Dialogue[]

Sevigne: Hello. Do you need anything?
 About the prototypes...
Sevigne: They were successfully recovered after the fact. It sure took a lot of effort to transport them.
Sevigne: After the inspection, we found both prototypes needed to be scrapped. They hadn't been maintained for a long time, plus...
Sevigne: Oh, I didn't mean to blame you. Mr. Maillardet has some new toys now and has completely forgotten about the prototypes.
Sevigne: He even delegated the recovery and inspection work. I had hoped I would have a chance to meet him, but it looks like I'll need to find an opportunity to visit Erinnyes for that...
 About Maillardet...
Sevigne: Objectively speaking, the Icewind Suite is of less commercial value than Fonta. After all, the original proposal came from Mr. Bossuet...
Sevigne: Mr. Maillardet took it over and then added his own color... But if you ask me, the undertaking is much like the man himself. How to put it kindly? There's room for development?
 About the portrait...‍[Does this require interacting with Bossuet's portrait?]
Sevigne: Oh, that... I was quite surprised that Mr. Bossuet didn't take it back to Petrichor.
Sevigne: After all, if it gets left here, who knows when someone will spill ink or some even harder to clean fluid on it...
Sevigne: I do have a few suspects in mind, but I expect that in the end Chisseray will be chosen to go to the Fortress of Meropide.
Sevigne: Goodness me, what am I doing! It's best not to say what you're really thinking in this kind of workplace.
 Nothing, sorry to bother you.
Sevigne: Then I hope you have a most wonderful day.
