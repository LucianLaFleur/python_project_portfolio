Dialogue[]

Arouet: Welcome to Café Lutece. Here we have the most bitter coffees and the sweetest cakes, with guests astute and absurd.
 Tell me about the sweet stuff...
Arouet: Every bite is as sweet as a Melusine's smile.
(Opens the Café Lutece Shop menu)
 Tell me about the bitter...
Arouet: Every customer has different tastes in coffee, and I shall satisfy them as I am able.
Arouet: But if someone were to order a coffee without a trace of bitterness, well, then, my abilities would be quite limited.
Arouet: In such circumstances, I would ask them to go to the Palais Mermonia or Salon Caritat, and speak to the first lady or gentleman they meet.
 Thanks, but I'll pass.
Arouet: You seem like a sensible person.
Arouet: But for me, sensibility and sobriety are different concepts.
Arouet: I always welcome customers who are sensible and wish them a happy and sweet day.
(Obtain  Conch Madeleine ×3)
 About the astute and the absurd...
Arouet: As you see, ours is a cafe and not a tavern.
Arouet: There are some gentlemen here who will speak of all manner of things while resting — and I find myself wishing that they said them with the excuse of being drunk.
Arouet: I fear that what people say when sober might be even more absurd than the babblings of drunkards.
 See you.
Arouet: Take care. Please come again.

Trivia[]
