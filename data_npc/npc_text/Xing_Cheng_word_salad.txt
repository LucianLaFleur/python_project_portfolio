 "They just don't get it!"

Dialogue[]

Xing Cheng: What does she know? All of our teas are valuable! What's wrong with taking it slow?
 C-Calm down.
Xing Cheng: Ugh, this is really ticking me off. She acts like I'm dragging my feet unloading the cargo, but it doesn't take that much time! What does she want me to do, toss the boxes straight down on the ground?
Xing Cheng: My tea is the most valuable cargo on this entire ship. If even a single box is damaged during unloading, I have to foot the bill, and I'm not holding out hope for any kind of reimbursement from her.
 Are these tea leaves very valuable?
Xing Cheng: These are all the finest teas from Qiaoying Village! Whether in terms of ingredients or processing, they simply can't be beat!
Xing Cheng: I really can't be bothered to argue with that ignorant fool.
Xing Cheng: Let's not talk about it for now. I'll have to reason with her later.
 B-Bye!
Xing Cheng: She doesn't know the first thing about this merchandise. It's enough to make me tear my hair out!
