Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

Sluasi: Why haven't the materials I ordered before arrived yet...
Sluasi: Hmm. The accessories you're wearing seem rather strange...
 My accessories?
Sluasi: Ah, I'm sorry. I'm an artisan — whenever I see ornaments and such that I've never seen before, my mind jumps right to "How do I make that"?
Sluasi: Ah, yours are so beautiful — simple yet full of charm. I love them.
 You spoke of materials you ordered...
Sluasi: That's right — I mean gems I ordered from a merchant in Fontaine.
Sluasi: I make all kinds of accessories out of gems, but conversely, I can't do my work without them.
Sluasi: *sigh* I just wish the goods would come in faster...
(After Step 3 of There Will Come Soft Rains and before completing Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog)
 About the earthquake just a while ago...
Sluasi: *sigh* To think that Puca's run off at a time like this...
Sluasi: Well, since she's got friends with her, things can't be too bad, right...?
 I've got some other things to attend to right now...
Sluasi: Alright then. See you.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing The Three Primary Colors of the Solar Corona.


Sluasi: Why haven't the materials I ordered before arrived yet...
Sluasi: Ah, we meet again. How are things? Would you like to purchase some accessories?
 How's the paint-making going?
Sluasi: They're still in the final adjustment phase. We should be done pretty soon!
Sluasi: It is taking longer than I thought it would, though... But just like with gems, I have to create the perfect paints.
Sluasi: If it isn't perfect work, it isn't worth doing. *sigh* If only Puca would understand that sooner...
 You spoke of materials you ordered...
Sluasi: That's right — I refer to gems I ordered from a merchant in Fontaine...
Sluasi: Just like how it is with the paint-making materials you showed me previously...
Sluasi: There is much work for a gem artisan like myself that cannot start without source materials.
Sluasi: Gah, I just wish those goods would come in faster...
 See you.
Sluasi: Alright then, bye!

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
Given that Melusines are named after fairy figures, "Sluasi" may be derived from the Sluagh, also known as the slúag sídhe, which are spirits of the unforgiven dead in Celtic folklore.
