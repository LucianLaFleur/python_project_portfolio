Dialogue[]

Goshtasb: Ah, welcome, please take a seat.
Goshtasb: I shall introduce you when the Lord returns.
 I don't see any empty seats.
Goshtasb: Yes, yes, sorry for the inconvenience.
Goshtasb: The Lord built such a big palace yet with no place for guests to wait at the gate. I found it confusing as well.
Goshtasb: Please wait. I will make sure to report to her about this.
 The Lord?
Goshtasb: Ah, so you don't know who lives here?
Goshtasb: That's funny. If you don't know who owns this place, then who are you here to see?
Goshtasb: I can't be of help if you don't know who you're looking for. Now, if you'll excuse my lack of decorum.
 Have a good day.
Goshtasb: Alright. Stay safe.
