Profile[]
Waiz was a student at Alkami's training center and one of the 20 students assigned to Kaveh's class. Like Uzayr and Tanisha, he was falsely sold the dream of striking it rich as an architect, and planned to use his riches to "leave his miserable days behind."
Unlike Uzayr and Tanisha, Waiz has no interest in architecture other than making Mora, and does not return to Alkami's training center after the Matra closes it down for investigation, with a new boy named Shurayh appearing instead.
Kaveh notices his absence and disappointedly makes note of it before announcing that he intends to continue teaching those who remained.
