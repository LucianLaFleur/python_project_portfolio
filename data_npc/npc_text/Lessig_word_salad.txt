Profile[]
Lessig decided to head to Sumeru after hearing of a way to restore the clan's honor. However, when he traveled through both Liyue and Sumeru, he was shocked to hear that no one cared or knew about him or their clan, realizing that he was taught to stick with the old ways and unable to see the truth until now, something which his cousin Eula had done long ago.
