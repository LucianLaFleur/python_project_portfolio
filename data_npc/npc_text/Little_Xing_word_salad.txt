Dialogue[]

Little Xing: Do you know what the most important thing is to have if you wanna be an adventurer?
 Let me guess...
Little Xing: Alright! What's your guess?
 Courage.
Little Xing: Yep! It's courage. Adventurers never know what they're gonna find, so they need courage to face it.
Little Xing: Like, I've never left the village on my own before, but I'm a big boy so I'm... I'm not scared.
Little Xing: It's the first step I need to take if I wanna become a mighty adventurer one day.
 Vision.
Little Xing: That's what Little Liu says. You definitely need a Vision.
Little Xing: With a Vision, you can do literally anything! Not just defeating all the monsters; you can get loadsa money too...
Little Xing: If I had loadsa money mom and dad wouldn't need to work away from home. They could stay in the village and it would be fun here like it used to be — like how Little Liu says it was!
 Paimon.
Little Xing: Paimon? What's a Paimon? No one's told me about them before.
Little Xing: I'm asking an honest question here, buddy, and I'd appreciate an honest answer, too.
Little Xing: Hmm... Is it some kind of food?
Little Xing: That would make sense; you can't let your tummy rumble when you're on an adventure.
 Who knows.
Little Xing: Huh. Okay then. Seems like Little Liu is the only one who's clued up on things around here...
