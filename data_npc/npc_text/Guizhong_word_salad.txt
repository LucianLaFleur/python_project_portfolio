Introduction[]
Teach with wisdom, be bound by virtue, fortify the bones, unite in ambition—Guizhong's Four Commandments
Guizhong is the late God of Dust who was one of the rulers of the Guili Assembly. She was kind-hearted and wise but not particularly powerful, so she worked alongside the more powerful Morax to rule the Guili Assembly together. Guizhong had a particular interest in mechanics: the Guizhong Ballista was one of her handiworks, built with the aid of the adepti, and she apparently collected Khaenri'ah technology such as Ruin Machines for research.[3]
After the start of the Archon War, she ultimately lost her life in a destructive battle that laid waste to Dihua Marsh and Guili Plains.[1]

Appearance[]
Guizhong took the form of a young woman with billowing sleeves.[4]
She has long, flowing gray hair that fades into a cerulean-blue. The back side is partially chopped in a bob-length fashion and the rest is tied into a rat-tail with a long dark-blue hairpin. The front is cut into neat, slightly side-swept bangs and is finished with a small dangling hair accessory.
Guizhong has long, shoulder-cut, billowing sleeves that covers her hands. The inside of the sleeves is adorned with the pattern of a starry night sky. Her outfit's color palette seems to resemble that of a Glaze Lily, as it is in many hues of white, blue, navy, and gray. There is even a Glaze Lily embroidered on each of her sleeves. The tails of her dress seem to appear to fragment at the ends, mirroring the nature of dust, being her association. She wears a blue anklet on her right foot and goes barefoot.
Guizhong typically has a face full of expression, specifically joy, in contrast to her unmoving partner Rex Lapis.

Story[]
Early life[]
It is unclear where exactly Guizhong descended from, or the exact year this took place, however it can be surmised that it happened at some point prior to the Archon War taking place. It is said that her reach "shrouded the skies for thousands of miles around."[5] Guizhong initially established her civilization at an unknown location in Liyue. At some point, she met Morax amid a field of Glaze Lilies and presented him with a stone dumbbell now known as the Memory of Dust as a mark of their pledge, although they never made a formal contract with each other.[4] The two became allies and Guizhong, with the help of the adepti, built the Guizhong Ballista at Tianheng Pass to autonomously defend from invaders.[6] She then moved her people north of Mt. Tianheng.[1]

Guili Assembly[]
Guizhong taught her people agriculture, which greatly expanded their sphere of influence. While displaying her handiwork to Morax, she dubbed the area "the Plains of the Returning and Departing" (Chinese: 归离原 Guīlí-yuán), or Guili Plains[1] — deriving the name from the first character of her name, combined with a character from the name Morax used at the time.[5] The Guili Assembly was established, co-ruled by the two gods alongside Marchosius, God of the Stove.[7] A group of people in Liyue Harbor intended to expand their city, and thus moved to Guili Plains.
During the establishment of the Guili Assembly, Guizhong established her four commandments:[5]

"To unite in ambition is to be steadfast and immovable for all time."
"Wisdom is like water, it nourishes all those who receive it and in it is a reflection of the truth."'
"Fortify the bones, that movement be supple when the time comes."
"Virtue grows tall like a tree, though there be shade it will flourish forever"
At some point in time, Guizhong created the Realm of Clouds, located in Luhua Pool. Some unknown point later, the adepti built an abode next to it to house the evil and ancient artifacts — Ruin Machines — she collected while researching mechanics.[3]
Cloud Retainer, Guizhong, and Morax often met up at Retainer's abode at Mt. Aocang to eat together. It is suggested that the three would each prepare a dish, which they would then eat at the table towards the middle of the pond. Guizhong's seat was on the north side, with a bowl and a pair of chopsticks on the table.[8]

Archon War and Death[]
During the Archon War, Guizhong and other adepti fought to protect the people of Guili against the many evil gods and monsters that had plagued Liyue's lands.
Guizhong lost her life in a fierce battle over Guili Plains, during which "black dust choked the heavens and a thousand rocks splintered."[5] She died amidst the Glaze Lilies, wearing one last lonely smile as she asked Morax to forget about the stone dumbbell she gave him and bemoaned the end of their journey together.[4] After her death, the yakshas can be seen containing the lingering energy the late deity expelled. A massive flood swept through Dihua Marsh and Guili Plains, effectively destroying the Guili Assembly.[9] Its inhabitants, with the help of Marchosius and the adepti, traveled south for ten days, establishing what is now known as Liyue Harbor.[1]

One had aspirations for a much larger model, hollow inside so that it could unfurl into a vehicle with which to embark on sight-seeing journeys with one's old friends... The challenges of powering and operating such a device, however, proved somewhat insurmountable. After all, it required pitch control, the ability to change form, not to mention the safety features... *sigh* If only Guizhong were still here. She, no doubt, would offer many baffling but ingenious solutions to this conundrum.More About Xianyun: IV Media:VO_Xianyun More About Xianyun - 04.ogg Media:VO ZH_Xianyun More About Xianyun - 04.ogg Media:VO JA_Xianyun More About Xianyun - 04.ogg Media:VO KO_Xianyun More About Xianyun - 04.ogg For all the wondrous feats that can be accomplished by one who has mastered the mechanical arts, one often uses it for purely recreational purposes. There was one year when it snowed heavily in Liyue, and Mt. Aocang was covered in several feet of snow. Seeing everyone cooped up in their abodes with nothing to do, one created a Snowdrift Mechanism for skiing on the mountains. One was having a tremendous time of it along with Guizhong and Streetward Rambler... until, of course, Moon Carver noticed as much and decided to join in. Moments later, he had managed to send the mechanism flying off the rails and plummeted deep into a snow bank. It took us hours to dig him out... Later, one introduced a great many safety features to the mechanism, to the point where it could be safely piloted by even a three-year-old child. Although this did entail a compromise on the top speed of the vehicle.
Trivia[]
Guizhong (Chinese: 归终) is a legendary Chinese beast mentioned in the Yiwen Leiju. It is a type of 狌狌 xīngxīng, a legendary ape-like beast said to know all about the past but cannot know the future.[10][11]
Glaze Lilies are a key element of the Rite of Parting, as Guizhong was a dear friend to Zhongli and Glaze Lilies were her favorite flower.
She created the Memory of Dust, the Cleansing Bell, and designed the Guizhong Ballista.
Zhongli can be seen fighting in Guizhong's Realm of Clouds in his Collected Miscellany trailer.
The "maiden in a long indigo robe" who wandered Guili Plains, spoken about in Records of the Gallant: Dust, is suggested to have some link to Guizhong based on its references to dust and the location of her sightings.
Someone's Poetry in Lingju Pass uses Guizhong's name (归终) in the Chinese version: 惟彼宇宙之难笼，苟循死生之归终。 However, the phrase is using the meaning of the characters, which roughly translates to "Return to the End."
Etymology[]
Following the theme of gods in Genshin Impact being named after demons in the Ars Goetia, Haagentus may be named after the demon Haagenti, one of the Great Presidents of Hell.
While the name Morax went by during the Guili Assembly is unknown, his current alias Zhongli (Chinese: 钟离) also contains the 离 lí character Guizhong used when she came up with "Guili" (Chinese: 归离), which was a portmanteau of their names.
Her title in Chinese  (Chinese: 尘王魔神 Chén Wáng Móshén) means "Dust-Lord God."
