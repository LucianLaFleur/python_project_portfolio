Dialogue[]

Maruf: Hmm, we don't have many bandages left... I should probably inform the village head the next time I see him.

(If the player loses the match)

Maruf: Victory and defeat are not that important. Don't worry, be happy!
(If the player wins the match)

Maruf: My, you really are skilled. I was so engrossed in the game! I bet our patients would really be able to put their troubles behind them with your help!
 You're...?
Maruf: I'm the best doctor in Aaru Village — that is to say, the only doctor in Aaru Village.
Maruf: Though I'd say that my greatest specialty is bandaging wounds.
Maruf: People who get injured out in the desert often wind up here in the village, and they rely on me to treat their wounds.
Maruf: Though Aaru Village consists of mostly children and the elderly, most of them are in good health and rarely get afflicted with any serious illnesses.
Maruf: As for minor ailments, I just give out medicine based on previous experience, and everything usually turns out fine.
 What if it's a serious illness then?
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

Maruf: Do you mean diseases as terrible as Eleazar?
Maruf: I'm afraid that in such cases, even the researchers of Sumeru City might be of little help. The only thing they can do is leave it up to fate.
Maruf: Of course, such cases would be very extreme ones.
Maruf: If anything beyond my control crops up... Then all I can do is to attempt to have them sent to the city.
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
 What happens in the case of very serious illnesses, then?
Maruf: Well, if something else comes up that's clearly beyond my abilities... then I can only attempt to send them to the city.
Maruf: Well, Lesser Lord Kusanali was able to cure something as awful as Eleazar, so I reckon the Bimarstan under her Akademiya must be pretty good, too!
 See you.
Maruf: See you. May you remain in good health.
