At the time, I was just thinking to stitch together a puppet girl who looked like me to be my model and assistant. Huh? What about a companion? No, I have no need for that.
Trivia[]
Tamoto's design is likely inspired by a Kokeshi doll, a traditional Japanese toy from Tōhoku region.
They are also symbols of hopes for bountiful harvests, wishes for luck and fortune, and signs of appreciation for craftsmanship and culture.
