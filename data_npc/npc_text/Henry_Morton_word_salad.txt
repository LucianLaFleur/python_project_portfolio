Location[]
Henry Morton's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Native to Mondstadt, he studied abroad at Sumeru Akademiya with his foreign friend. There, he spent his time indoors, having no time left for outdoor activities. While his friend became an archaeologist and came to Mondstadt to research the Thousand Winds Temple, Henry continued his studies at the Akademiya.
To his alarm, he didn't hear from him for a while and contacted the Adventurers' Guild for aid. Unfortunately, there was no news of him whatsoever. He then halted his studies and hurried to his friend's last known whereabouts, the Thousand Winds Temple, hopeful for clues.
Upon hearing news of an identical sundial appearing on the Nameless Island thanks to the Traveler, he plans to search for his now missing friend and fellow researcher.

Appearance[]
Henry Morton is a man of average height and build with bright blue eyes, framed by a gold pince-nez. He has ruffled brown hair, and a petite hazel goatee. He wears a matching set of maroon capri pants and an open collared button shirt, going over a long-sleeved beige shirt.

(After completing Time and Wind)
Henry Morton: Oh, this island is so far away. How will I get across?
 You can use a wind glider.
Henry Morton: Forget it. I've been shut indoors ever since joining the Sumeru Akademiya. I haven't done any outdoor activities since.
Henry Morton: You can't really use your wind glider at the Akademiya either, so I've probably returned all my gliding instructor's teachings back to them...
Henry Morton: If you asked me to glide over there, I'd probably fall into the water halfway.
 You could charter a boat.
Henry Morton: I thought so too, and I did remember that you could charter one at Dornman Port, but that's way too far away.
Henry Morton: Who knows how long a round trip will take, either...
Henry Morton: But I couldn't possibly construct my own boat. I mean, I learned nothing about that in the Akademiya...

Trivia[]
His location changes slightly after completing Time and the Wind, moving beside the tent.
Henry Morton Stanley was also an explorer famous for his search of David Livingstone, paralleling Henry's search for his missing friend. Other characters from Mondstadt share this connection, i.e., Stanley and Dr. Livingstone.
Like Timmie, he has no idle voice-over.
