Dialogue[]
Langqing becomes available after completing "A Meeting of Melodies II - Evening Breeze Serenade" and decorating the venue.


(Prior to completion of ...It's the Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness!)
Langqing: Is that you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? Oh my! I've heard so much about you from Fangfang.
 You have me at a disadvantage, sir.
Langqing: Ah, right! I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Langqing. Fangfang is Wanwen Bookhouse's Jifang. She's my wife, you see. She was the one who told me about this event.
Langqing: I don't know much about rock 'n' roll, but Fangfang says that we should support the latest cultural trends, so here I am.
Langqing: I brought some free cultural products as well. They got snapped up in a heartbeat! Ah, if only I'd known, I'd have brought more.
Langqing: She also asked me to thank you for the invitation. Had she not been so busy, she would have come down here herself, I'm sure of it.
Langqing: I hope you'll enjoy yourself here too.
 See you.
Langqing: Indeed. See you around.


(After completion of ...It's the Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness!)
Langqing: Hey! That final performance was really something. Did you see it too, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
 I thought there was room for improvement.
Langqing: That it does, but that's normal. I mean, even books like "How Mora is Made" aren't universally acclaimed.
Langqing: Just pick the books you enjoy reading, and listen to your favorite music.
 I thought it went pretty well.
Langqing: I have to agree! I didn't think that rock 'n' roll of this kind existed, it's even different from the sort Fangfang and I heard in Fontaine. I'd love to collect some literature adjacent to the matter.
Langqing: Don't forget to drop by Wanwen Bookhouse more often if you've got the time.
 I think it's great.
Langqing: You like it that much? There's something I need to give you then, haha.
Langqing: I already gave out all the cultural souvenirs I brought before, and I feel bad for not holding one back for you... so it looks like this is my chance.
Langqing: That Fontainian musician — you know, the one that carries a guitar around — said it was alright for me to record the final version of his lyrics and sell them on as music merchandise.
Langqing: Here, please take it. It's nothing valuable, but if you like it you can keep it as a souvenir.
(Obtain  "I Got Reincarnated as an Onikabuto... And Flipped the World Upside Down")
 I think it's great.
Langqing: I can tell! If you didn't like it, you wouldn't have come back just to tell me again, haha!
