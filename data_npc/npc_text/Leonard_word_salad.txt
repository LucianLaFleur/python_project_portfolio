Profile[]
Leonard's lifelong dream was to reach the summit of a mountain called Pilos Peak, and his journal, "Of Mountains and Seas," was written on his attempt to conquer it.[2] The strength of his will was so strong, some two thousand years later, it induced the meteorite showers during Unreconciled Stars that sent those who touched it into a deep slumber, where they dreamt of ascending the mountain. Those trapped in the dream felt compelled to climb it, as though possessed.
He somehow knew Venerare of the Lawrence Clan, who supported his efforts to climb Pilos Peak in some way.[3]

Notes[]

↑ While Mona only says "two thousand years ago," he must have lived around 2600 years ago, before Decarabian's fall and Barbatos' ascension to the position of Anemo Archon. After Barbatos became the Anemo Archon, he reshaped Mondstadt and in the process, turned Pilos Peak into the modern-day Musk Reef; for Leonard to attempt to climb Pilos Peak means he had to have done so before Barbatos ascended. He also personally knew Venerare, the leader of the Lawrence Clan at the time Barbatos became the Anemo Archon, which indicates they were contemporaries.
