Profile[]
So this Nathan fellow disguised himself as a fellow "freedom fighter," armed with slogans that were easy to identify with... and with an ice-cold heart, with which he pushed our most radical groups onto a path from which there was no returning...—Shizuru, Clean House
Nathan was an agent of the Fatui sent by the First Harbinger[1] to infiltrate the Watatsumi Army to dash their hopes for a quick victory, and thus drag out the war between them and the Shogunate.[2] Claiming that his Mondstadt heritage instilled him with the ideal of freedom, and thus did not agree with the Shogunate's oppressive regime, he ingratiated himself with certain Orobashi fanatics in the Resistance.
Seeing that these fanatics sought to restore the "glory" of their slain god, Nathan devised a way to break the Raiden Shogun's wards on Yashiori Island and convinced them that this would restore Orobashi's "dignity." This plan was neither devised nor approved by the Resistance leader, Sangonomiya Kokomi, and those in on the plan did not want her to be implicated in their scheme in the event that they were caught.[3] While they succeeded in breaking the wards, this instead unleashed the Tatarigami, causing people on the island to fall ill or go mad. The war came to a stalemate as the effects of Tatarigami proved to be dangerous to both sides of the war.
After discovering the Fatui's involvement with the Resistance, the Traveler raids a Fatui Delusion factory and can find some papers revealing Nathan's culpability. While the Traveler is unconscious from Scaramouche's trap, the Resistance raided the factory and came upon the same documents. Nathan attempted to flee Inazuma, but was captured and is now in prison, awaiting trial.[1]

Appearance[]
Nathan wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the ashigaru (Japanese: 足軽) of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient shitagi with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray kobakama, and waraji sandals without the socks. Although not visible, the Sangonomiya Clan's crest is imprinted on the back of the shitagi, below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with sode (shoulder armor), han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it. Nathan is equipped with a juumonji yari, whose shaft is colored with a red-white gradient and has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest under the spearhead.

Dialogue[]

Nathan: Why, I never! To think there'd be an outlander like me here.
Nathan: This place really is the top pick if you're here to travel. Take good care of yourself, now. The situation here is very unstable.
 Ah, so you're an outlander as well?
Nathan: I'm from Mondstadt. My travel brings me to Inazuma.
Nathan: I've witnessed the tyranny of the Shogunate and the sufferings of its people. Such things would've never been condoned in my hometown, Mondstadt.
Nathan: That's why I joined up with the Sangonomiya resistance and pledged to fight for freedom.
 How's the situation right now?
Nathan: Though I am a part of the resistance, if I'm to be frank about the situation, both sides have their strengths.
Nathan: The Shogunate is better trained, organized, and equipped. However, the Sangonomiya troops have unwavering morale and determination, and the people are extremely united.
Nathan: Don't underestimate the will of the people. Even though the resistance can muster fewer troops and is outmatched in equipment on the battlefield, we still believe that we have a fighting chance.
 Mind telling me a bit about yourself?
Nathan: Me? Ehh, I'm just an ordinary person from Mondstadt. I've never gotten any training, nor was I a knight.
Nathan: If you've been to Mondstadt, you'd know we lead a very laid back lifestyle.
Nathan: Personally I can't accept the Shogunate's way of stripping others of their freedom. That's the reason why I'm so concerned about the current situation.
Nathan: Still, it's not like I've made a huge difference by joining the Sangonomiya faction either. I just try to help out as much as I can, haha.
 Goodbye.
Nathan: Farewell, Traveler, and may the Anemo Archon protect you.
