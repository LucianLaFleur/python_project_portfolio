Bamoun is the former leader of the Temple of Silence. At some point, he rescued Cyrus from the desert, who agreed to work with him, and later adopted Sethos.
Aware that the organization's reputation was on the decline, Bamoun eventually came upon two Ba Fragments — shards of Hermanubis' raw power. Knowing that the fragments would restore the organization's glory, he looked for suitable candidates to resonate with them. Unfortunately, most of the volunteers failed, but he soon discovered that Sethos and another child could resonate with them. The other child — Cyno, was with his parents. Bamoun paid Cyno's biological parents a large sum of Mora for his custody and brought him to the Temple of Silence to continue resonating with the fragments.
Bamoun soon discovered that the fragments were unstable and he ultimately chose to rush the second step of the process, implanting the shards directly into both children to save them from being lost forever. This act did not go well with Cyrus, who proceeded to leave the organization and took Cyno with him back to the Sumeru Akademiya. Bamoun was upset with his actions, but decided to not pursue the matter further for the time being.
Bamoun later became stricken with a fatal disease, but was able muster enough willpower to continue living in the hopes that he could see the organization's glory restored. Aware that the Temple of Silence had ostracized relations with the Akademiya in the past, he knew that they had to mend relationships with them, and his successor had to let go of the past. Collaborating with Sethos, they hired a scholar named Urraca to slander Cyrus, giving him a note that threatened Cyrus. Cyrus, knowing that he had to pay for his transgression, chose to confront Bamoun, which prompted Cyno to chase after him.
At the temple's headquarters, Bamoun ultimately agreed to a duel between Cyno and Sethos, knowing that regardless of the outcome, the organization's future would be secured. He was also impressed to see a living Tighnarian, due to their relationship with Hermanubis. On the day of the duel, Bamoun witnessed Cyno and Sethos' fight. Sethos ultimately lost the duel, and as Cyno absorbed his fragment, a bright light engulfed the chamber while Bamoun was left in awe. He shortly died after the duel ended, content with the outcome.
