Tominaga Masanari was the third-generation heir of the Souran Isshin Art. He was able to befriend the youkai Kamai Kenji, and five hundred years ago, they fought side-by-side until their final moments. The blade he used was from the founder of the Souran Isshin Art and Kamai's best friend, Yanagibashi Takuto.[1]
