Dialogue[]

Charlene: Hello! Is there anything I can do for you?
 Feeling good?
Charlene: Uh huh, why not? Whatever happens, happens. I don't need to worry about something that hasn't even happened yet!
Charlene: Don't you think so? It sounds like a deep philosophy of life, right?
(Obtain  Hero's Wit ×2)
 Sorry, you're...
Charlene: I'm a new member of the Gardes. Call me Charlene.
Charlene: And if you can't remember the name, just go with "hey," "you," or "newbie," or whatever. Pleased to be at your service!
 I probably shouldn't use all those names...
Charlene: Huh, is that a problem? I mean, the important thing is the incident details, not my title, right?
Charlene: Besides, the less people know our names, the better!
Charlene: A Gardes member's name only ever gets published in The Steambird when something goes wrong, anyway.
 See you.
Charlene: See you! Hope I don't see you at the scene of a crime, alright? Hehe.
