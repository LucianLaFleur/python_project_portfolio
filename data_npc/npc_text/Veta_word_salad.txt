Dialogue[]

Veta: Wanna play a game with me?
 What game?
Veta: A game of guessing your savings.
Veta: I'll call out a number, and you can tell me if it's higher or lower than the correct number. Bet you'll get it in 3 guesses.
 This game might breach privacy...
Veta: Huh? C'mon, don't you trust me? I won't tell anyone else, honest!
Veta: I just want to know if I'm reading people right, you know?
 Why are you playing over here?
Veta: My dad's a Snezhnayan envoy who's been posted to the Northland Bank. He won't let me run too far off.
Veta: Look, that's the bank. It's between a clockwork workshop and the clock shop. Pretty awesome, isn't it?
Veta: My dad's taught me how to distinguish between good and bad people, so don't worry, I'm not gonna go running off with bad people
 Next time, perhaps.
Veta: Alright, guess I'll just play with someone else.
