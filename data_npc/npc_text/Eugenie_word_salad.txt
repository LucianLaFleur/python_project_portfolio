Dialogue[]

Eugenie: Would you like to see some fresh fruit?
 Lemme have a look.
Eugenie: Each one of my veggies and fruits is filled with the spirit of water, so feel free to take your pick!

(If the player loses the match)

Eugenie: Fresh decks are rarer than Wolfhooks, so they're difficult, huh?
(If the player wins the match)

Eugenie: What the heck! You play like an Ajilenakh Nut... I have no idea how to deal with that!
 And you are...
Eugenie: Hello there! I'm the owner of this stall.
Eugenie: My apologies for disturbing you with my hollering. Please understand — and don't mind me if a few extras make it into your bag, should you make a purchase. Hehe.
 Really?
Eugenie: Yes! This batch of fruits just arrived this morning from Mondstadt. They are really sweet! Feel free to try some! If it's delicious, please come again!
(Obtain  Valberry ×4)
 About the fruits and vegetables...
Eugenie: We produce lots of Bulle Fruit locally, but with our advanced water routes, we can import many fruits from outside as well — they'll just cost a little extra.
Eugenie: But don't you fret. I, Eugenie, will commit no fraudulent act. Every fruit you buy is one hundred percent delicious. Not a single bad apple amongst them!
 See you.
Eugenie: come back again if you've the time. I'll have our best waiting for you when you do.
