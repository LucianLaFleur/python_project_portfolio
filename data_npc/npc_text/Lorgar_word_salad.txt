Dialogue[]

(Before completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
Lorgar: Hey! Traveler!
Lorgar: It's dangerous ahead! Don't go that way!
(After completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
Lorgar: In front of you is the danger zone... Huh? Could you possibly be...
 ...What's wrong?
(Before completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
Lorgar: The roads ahead are dangerous — a convoy was attacked by powerful monsters in the mountain pass.
Lorgar: We better leave if we have no business here.
(After completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
Lorgar: Your attire... Could you be the traveler they spoke of?
Lorgar: Huh? You don't? Your heroic deeds have already spread across Mondstadt. I heard that it was you who put an end to the storms that terrorized Mondstadt!
Lorgar: Though I believe you're capable of dealing with the monsters ahead, I'd still like to ask you to watch out and take care.
(Regardless of whether The Outlander Who Caught the Wind is completed)
 How's the situation?
Lorgar: It's not looking too good... The hilichurls have been increasingly active recently, it's becoming quite a headache.
Lorgar: But there's not much I can do beyond warning the adventurers and travelers around here to watch their backs.
Lorgar: Here are some notes I jotted down, maybe you'll find them helpful. Take care now.
(Obtain  Adventurer's Experience ×3)
 Have you seen anyone who looks a lot like me?
Lorgar: Someone like you? Why, yes, I believe I have...
Lorgar: A lot of young adventurers like you will come tramping into the Stormbearer Mountains. I turn most of them back, which is good, since it's quite dangerous up ahead...
Lorgar: Oh— You're looking for a relative, then? I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.
Lorgar: I don't think the person you're looking for has come to the Stormbearer Mountains. Best you go look somewhere else.
 Goodbye.
Lorgar: Take care.
