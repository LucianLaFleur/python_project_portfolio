Profile[]
Anton is a member of the Ninth Company, originally sent to the Chasm to help deal with a mysterious black sludge in a joint agreement with the Liyue Qixing to combat the darkness underneath. The mission failed as the device the Fatui used exploded and failed to purify anything. This resulted in the company shattering, with men going missing or dying and Anton was forced to assume command of some soldiers — Danila, Radomir, Temur and Romanski, the latter eventually dying.
The Traveler, sent to investigate hilichurl activity in the Chasm, found Anton and his remaining men. Anton begged for food which the Traveler gave them, only for another group to arrive and attack for it. The Traveler drove the unwelcome Fatui away. Anton then explained that all of the Fatui were provisioned from a supply line and asked them to check on his behalf, as the men he had sent never returned. After searching the premises, they found a note from Yanbo that explained that the Fatui were no longer welcome in Liyue due to Childe unleashing Osial on its people and brought it to Anton and his men. The four soldiers were surprised by the turn of events outside but accepted the outcome nonetheless. Anton then thanked and rewarded the Traveler, allowing them to ask a few questions before he and the others made a break to the surface.

Trivia[]
"Antoha" (Russian: Антоха Antokha) is a slang form of the name "Anton" (Russian: Антон Anton). Slang forms of Russian names give the sense of "male brotherhood" that was once expressed by the patronymic-only form of address in the Soviet Union.
Anton appears to have been good friends with the Millelith soldier Yanbo at one point, with the latter in charge of supplying rations to the Fatui expedition.
Etymology[]
Anton's surname, Melnikov (Russian: Мельников Mel'nikov), may be inspired by Andrey Melnikov (Russian: Андрей Мельников Andrey Mel'nikov), a member of the real-life 9th Company who perished in the line of duty during the Battle for Hill 3234. He was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for his actions.
