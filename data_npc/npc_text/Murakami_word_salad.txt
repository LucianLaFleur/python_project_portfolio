Dialogue[]

Murakami: Greetings, we sell festival snacks here. Would you like to try some?
 Festival snacks...
Murakami: Ha, though we called them festival snacks, they really are no different from ordinary dishes. The difference lies in the wrappings.
Murakami: It's just as delicious, though! Besides, food you eat at festivals always feel a little more special somehow, don't they?
Murakami: Either way, my shop is always open whether there's an event on or not. You're welcome to come and stuff your face if you ever get hungry.
 Long time no see! (available after completing With You)
Murakami: My, my, if it isn't Miss Kamisato's friend. Welcome!
Murakami: Ever since you brought Miss Kamisato here last time, we've been having more and more people come to try our Sakura Mochi and Egg Rolls!
Murakami: I'll definitely take good care of you and Miss Kamisato the next time you two come again.
Murakami: Say, have you mastered the Sakura Mochi recipe yet?
 I've almost got it down.
Murakami: I like that confidence!
Murakami: I was about to say that you can come and ask me if you have any issues with the recipe, but it seems like you've got it all under control!
Murakami: Ah, it'd be wonderful if everyone was able to enjoy delicious food that they made by themselves.
 Goodbye.
Murakami: Remember to come back again if you're ever hungry!
