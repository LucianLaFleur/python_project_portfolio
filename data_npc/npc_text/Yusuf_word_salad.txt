Dialogue[]

Yusuf: Great work I've done today!
 You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
Yusuf: This isn't pride talking. It is a fact.
Yusuf: At such a young age, I am already so capable! I can support myself!
Yusuf: I work for Ms. Sulaykha. I do the daily registration every day, and get my pay at the end of the day.
Yusuf: If I keep doing this, I'll get paid for life, and I can eat Uncle Lambad's fish rolls every day.
 That's very... far-sighted.
Yusuf: Of course! You may not know this, but Ms. Sulaykha is a real genius. She was invited to study at Akademiya.
Yusuf: She rejected those block-headed adults, though. She said, and I quote, "Learning is no fun compared to making money."
Yusuf: Ms. Sulaykha also told me that the biggest secret to building wealth is to "stay away from the Kalimi Exchange."
Yusuf: A genius boss with a caring heart. I should have enough to last me for life!
 Are the fish rolls good?
Yusuf: I could eat them every day. You tell me if they're good or not.
Yusuf: Try them yourself if you don't believe me! Lambad's original fish roll will knock your socks off!
(Obtain  Lambad Fish Roll ×3)
 That's amazing.
Yusuf: Thank you! I think so too.
