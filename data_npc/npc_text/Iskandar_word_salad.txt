Seek violence, and violence shall find you.—Iskandar, Bimarstan's Proverb Column
Little is known about Iskandar at the moment. Jazari quotes him while observing the Ruin Golem at Devantaka Mountain, claiming "Behold. Thousands of years of ancient Khaenri'ah history lie before us!"[2] Based on this, it can be assumed that he studied Khaenri'ah's history at some point.
