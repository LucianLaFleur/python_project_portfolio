Kagami Gozen (Japanese: 鏡御前) was a Tenryou Commission official in Tatarasuna and the leader of Mikage Furnace workers. She met with Alice before the outbreak of Vision Hunt Decree civil war and was subsequently described by her in Teyvat Travel Guide. Her current status (following the war and Archon Quest consequences) is unknown.

According to Alice, Kagami "seems to be a leader amongst the workers there, and has an official Shogunate post." During that time, the workers of Tatarasuna "trust and love" her, and hold her and her commands in as high regards as Tenryou Commissioner and Raiden Shogun.[1]
Kagami "frowns often" and is "very unfriendly-looking," for unknown reasons. Her body "has scars from high-temperature burns from Tatarigami."[1]
It is unknown what happened to her after Alice's travel, but it is known that after the ceasefire between the Shogunate and resistance, the Shogunate temporarily halted all production in Tatarasuna,[2][3] and that Tenryou Commission underwent several big changes,[4][5] both possibly rendering Kagami out of work.
