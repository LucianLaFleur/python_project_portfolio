Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade.


Ding Jr.: Did you hear the rumors about the water and the soil?
 Rumors?
Ding Jr.: Shhh! Don't let anyone else hear! I'm only telling you, alright!?
Ding Jr.: There've been more and more Xuanwen Beasts skulking in the mountains lately. A fiend must be behind all this, or something!
Ding Jr.: If you ask me, the quality of the tea's gone down because these monsters contaminated the water and the soil.
 Okay, that's reaching a bit too far...
Ding Jr.: You have no idea just how complicated it is.
Ding Jr.: I think we'll need a thaumaturge to exorcise the fiends... or find some really powerful people to settle this.
 I'm more interested in that machine than rumors...
Ding Jr.: A practical one, aren't you? No interest in rumors, all work, work, work... Gah, you're making me feel bad.
Ding Jr.: Anyway, this is the machine we use to bake the tea leaves. Some of the tea is placed in here after stirring to get rid of the moisture.
Ding Jr.: The flames under the machine might be powerful, but the temperature inside isn't too high, so the process takes a good while.
Ding Jr.: I don't need to watch the machine every second, so all in all, this job's not too tiring.
Ding Jr.: But Ol' Senior can't be distracted at all. I'm afraid I can't do his job yet...
 Goodbye.
Ding Jr.: Take care, and see you next time!

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade.


Ding Jr.: Have you heard the rumors about the Carp Adeptus?
 Rumors?
Ding Jr.: Shhh! Don't let anyone else hear! I'm only telling you, alright!?
Ding Jr.: A kind Carp Adeptus awakened recently, saw the damage in Chenyu Vale, and stopped the Xuanwen Beasts from wreaking more havoc.
Ding Jr.: If that rumor's true, the quality of tea will return to normal soon, easy!
Ding Jr.: Maybe it'll even be better than before!
 If you really twist it, it kinda makes sense...
Ding Jr.: Moving, huh?
Ding Jr.: But baking is something I have to do every day, so my days are more or less the same.
Ding Jr.: If only the Carp Adeptus could make tea easier to process... Or improve my techniques...
 I'm more interested in that machine than rumors...
Ding Jr.: A practical one, aren't you? No interest in rumors, all work, work, work... Gah, you're making me feel bad.
