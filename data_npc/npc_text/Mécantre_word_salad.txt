Profile[]
According to Félix Yogue, Mécantre and his brother Babisse are currently working on a "super-sized cannon [...] that [...] shall fire missiles that can fly high enough to touch the stars of Teyvat... all while carrying people inside." Félix also says that they are still searching for a suitable fuel type for their project and notes that they are likely rather downcast at the moment.[1]

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Canticles of Harmony.


Mécantre: I must find a way to resolve these engineering issues, post-haste...
 What issues?
Mécantre: Why that of the high-altitude aqueducts, of course! These will become key arteries for Remuria, allowing purveyors, pedestrians, and pilgrims alike to pass.
Mécantre: But there are still a great many issues to solve. First, materials! Then, the bridge support schematics...
 A high-altitude aqueduct, here?
Mécantre: We're still in the design phase, of course. I shall have to undertake some discussions to perfect the plans before construction begins.
Mécantre: Ah... What an investment of resources and manpower.
Mécantre: Such wonders are only possible thanks to our God King's grace. I am truly blessed to have been granted the opportunity to dedicate my life to this work...
 See you.
Mécantre: See you, outlander. Watch yourself on the road.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Canticles of Harmony.


Mécantre: That's right. You just couldn't learn to "daydream"... There's no lack of reality all around us. You just lacked that power to dream...

Dialogue Set #3[]
Available after completing Daydreams Beyond Space and Time.


Mécantre: Speaking of cannons, the bigger the better, wouldn't you say?
 C—Cannons? What sort?
Mécantre: The sort that'll blast cannonballs up into the skies! I intend to place the gun mount here, um... Well, maybe a bit farther away, but not too far.
Mécantre: After that, we'll have to draw up a restricted zone. When that cannon fires, the spherical blast wave is going to be quite strong.
Mécantre: We'll have to place the audience in suitable positions...
Mécantre: Such that they can view the firing without fear that their hats might get blown clean off.
 I... don't see anything.
Mécantre: Of course. The cannon is still in the design phase.
Mécantre: I am also looking into the materials we'll need to make that cannon. They need to be sufficiently hard and heat-resistant...
Mécantre: Or our cannon would get off one shot, then "boom," it'd be a goner.
Mécantre: I'm even considering placing the cannon in the shallows, or perhaps directly in water! That way, it should be easier to cool off, and we can transport cannonballs by water. Truly, nothing but benefits from doing so!
Mécantre: Of course, I'll have to solve the problem of forging the cannon itself first...
 Looks like you're in good shape now.
Mécantre: Haha! Indeed I am. More experiences mean more inspiration for more research.
Mécantre: I must say that the inspiration I got from "that fellow" is... outdated in some places, but it was useful overall.
Mécantre: Once I'm done with my cannon, I'll draw up designs for that high-altitude waterway.
Mécantre: I doubt I could build a new aquabus line completely... but a scale model should be doable.
Mécantre: I shall show him the power of "daydreams," hahaha!
 See you around.
Mécantre: See you! Do come visit once the cannon is complete — I'll save you a special seat!
