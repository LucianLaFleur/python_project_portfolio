Profile[]
Romeuf is a former Spina di Rosula member. He left the organization following a fallout with Callas over the Aquabus system; Romeuf believed the funds used for its construction would be better off improving Poisson, while Callas believed that the system would pay off in the long term due to its cooperation with the Court of Fontaine and Fontaine Research Institute. When his wife, Clementine, also supported the idea, Romeuf and his followers believed that she had lost her credibility as an impartial mediator due to her pregnancy. They eventually parted on bad terms due to Callas' stubbornness.
Even after both Callas and Clementine's deaths, Romeuf and his followers saw Navia with disdain, believing her to be the same as her father. While desperately low on Mora, Romeuf concocts a plan to kill Navia by collapsing the Clementine Line, resulting in the rubble destroying Poisson in the process. Upon learning of Colter's release from the Fortress of Meropide, he tasks him with killing Navia; however, he could not get the chance with the Traveler around. Following a chance encounter with one of Romeuf's subordinates, Martinat, Colter tips off Romeuf and his subordinates of Florent's check, allowing them to escape and start their plan. He also sends several subordinates to infiltrate the town to sabotage any evacuation attempts.
The plan is foiled by the Traveler and Navia, who stop most of the intended damage on the line and the rubble from destroying Poisson. The Maison Gardiennage, alerted to the attack, soon arrive and arrest Romeuf and all of his subordinates, which Navia has no qualms with despite them being ex-Spina members due to their willingness to harm innocents rather than talk with her.
