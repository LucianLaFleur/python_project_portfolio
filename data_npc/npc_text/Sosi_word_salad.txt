(Condition missing)‍[available during Step 3 of The Splendorous Sky That Day; when does this become available, and when does it stop being available?]
(What's that paragraph supposed to mean...)

(Maybe I should discuss this with someone else... Who should I go to?)

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before beginning The Splendorous Sky That Day.‍[see Dialogue Set #2 remarks]


Sosi: Outlander from afar... speak to the Vijnanapati if you have matters to discuss.
 What are you doing here?
Sosi: I'm... Ahem, you need not know that much.
Sosi: If there's nothing else, please leave as soon as possible.
 I won't disturb you then.
Sosi: Alright. I'll be continuing with my work.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after beginning The Splendorous Sky That Day.‍[This dialogue is (erroneously) available before even meeting Pyrrho, let alone Sorush. But exactly when does this dialogue (erroneously) become available?]


Sosi: Lady Sorush's Yasnapati... Don't give up so easily. You should... try harder.
 Has something happened?
Sosi: Oh, it's nothing. I'm not making much progress in my research, that's all. This is all part and parcel of a researcher's life.
 I won't disturb you then.
Sosi: Thank you for your understanding. I'll be continuing with my work then.

Dialogue Set #3[]
Condition missing


Sosi: ...Oh! It's you, Lady Sorush's Yasnapati. If you have any questions at all, I'll make sure to tell you everything I know.
 About the Khvarena Monument...
Sosi: As you may have noticed, I haven't given up on investigating the Order of Skeptics' documents.
Sosi: Although there had been some discrepancies between the records and the apparent situation...
Sosi: I believe that as long as I look closely enough, the truth will emerge sooner or later.
 About the Fatui...
Sosi: Thanks to you all, Markozov has already withdrawn his troops.
Sosi: However, the Fatui would never give up that easily...
Sosi: Perhaps it's time for the Order of Skeptics to recruit more capable personnel. At the very least, they should do better than Pyrrho.
 About the Order of Skeptics...
Sosi: Our Vijnanapati... No, Nasejuna's actions have been despicable. Yet you were still able to extinguish the Sign of Apaosha... Impressive as always, Lady Sorush.
Sosi: My only regret is that I couldn't participate in such a historical moment myself...
 I won't disturb you then.
Sosi: You're too kind. I'll be continuing with my work then.
