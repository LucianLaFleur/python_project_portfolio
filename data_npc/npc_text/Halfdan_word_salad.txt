Profile[]
Halfdan was one of the elites in the Khaenri'ah's Royal Guards. During the cataclysm, Dainsleif as the "Twilight Sword" ordered him to protect the people of Khaenri'ah at all costs. Halfdan survived, but as with many inhabitants of Khaenri'ah, was affected by an unknown curse and transformed into a Black Serpent Knight: Windcutter.
Even as a Shadowy Husk, Halfdan remembered Dainsleif's orders and protected dying hilichurls who were entering underground areas of the Chasm, protecting them as they were former Khaenri'ah inhabitants. Halfdan would eventually run into Dainsleif, the Traveler and Paimon during their investigation as they believed that the Abyss Order were planning something nefarious. After defeating some Shadowy Husks guarding the hilichurls, more arrived, but Halfdan ordered them to stand down and showed the trio around, indicating them to follow him along a path.
The Abyss Order intended to remove the curse through an amplification device on the water pool found in the ruins, but the process was unlikely to succeed and wreaked suffering upon the former Khaenri'ah inhabitants. Despite the pain, Halfdan stopped the device at the cost of his own life, after which he re-appeared before Dainsleif as a spirit. Dainsleif reassured him with a lie that Khaenri'ah still stood, allowing him to pass on peacefully.

Appearance[]
As one of the elite Royal Guards of Khaenri'ah, Halfdan wore a desaturated purple shirt with a white epaulette on his shoulders featuring a pinned eight-pointed black star in the middle and black pants.
As a cursed inhabitant of Khaenri'ah, Halfdan shares the same appearance as with all other Windcutter knights.
