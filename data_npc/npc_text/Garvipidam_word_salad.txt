Profile[]
Garvipidam is one of the co-creators of Genius Invokation TCG, which he created alongside his friend Gulab to pass the time during the latter's hospitalization. The game soon became popular in the hospital, but Gulab eventually died from complications from Eleazar. Garvipidam tried to play the game with others, but kept imagining that he was playing with Gulab and became depressed, retreating to a small hut in Vimara Village as the game's popularity surged.
Garvipidam cared for Gulab, as he kept visiting Gulab in the hospital whenever he could despite Gulab's insistence that he should focus on his studies. He believed that Gulab would recover from Eleazar despite otherwise, and when Gulab died he became devastated that he found himself unable to play the game the two had created until learning that Gulab had intended to help him make more friends.
Gulab had sent a package through Komaniya Express prior to his passing, but it went undelivered following his death and the company's inability to find Garvipidam, instead tasking Kirara with doing so in her spare time. They would eventually discover him in Vimara Village and after learning of his friend's intentions, began to cheer up again.
