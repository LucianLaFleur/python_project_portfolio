Dialogue[]

Blathine: Up and down the fountain goes — it's like a magic trick.
 Do you like magic?
Blathine: Yup.
Blathine: I've got good enough eyes to catch even the smallest details at a crime scene, but I can't understand the secrets of magic tricks.
Blathine: Magicians really are awesome, to be able to fool even a Melusine's eyes.
 Do you like fountains?
Blathine: Yup, I do. Fountain water never stops — it's full of life!
Blathine: Take these tall pillars of water, especially — sometimes they're up, and sometimes they're down. Aren't they like the music that plays in the background during an opera?
Blathine: That said, I don't really like watching performances at the opera house. They're created, engineered human behavior — they're not real to me.
 See you.
Blathine: Bye! Take care not to let the fountain get you wet.
