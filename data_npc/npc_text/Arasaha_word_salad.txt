Arasaha: Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)...
Arasaha: We will not help you suppress the Bulky Iron Chunk. You will be on your own. Is that okay?
 I'll be fine!
Arasaha: Okay. Be careful.
 I'll need to make some preparations.
Arasaha: Okay. I will wait.
(Fight the Bulky Iron Chunk)
(Talk to Arasaha after defeating the Bulky Iron Chunk)
Arasaha: Impressive, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Arasaha: The Bulky Iron Chunk not suppressed by any Ararakalari has been... defeated...
Arasaha: Mmm... The Bulky Iron Chunk with all Ararakalari lifted... Do you wish to challenge it again?
 Let's go again.
Arasaha: Okay! Here it goes!
 Not now.
