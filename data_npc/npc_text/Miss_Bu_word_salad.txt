Dialogue[]

Miss Bu: I sense that you are searching for someone... Am I correct?
Miss Bu: Or perhaps you come here because of the legend?
 I am searching for someone...
Miss Bu: Then it is as I thought! Though for Miss Bu the Fortune Teller, this was easy to discern.
Miss Bu: People like you I can read like a book... Ahem, I mean, it is easy to tell the fortunes of those such as yourself.
Miss Bu: For example... I know that you hold many secrets in your mind... that you sometimes feel lonely... and that there is someone who holds a very special place in your heart...
 You could say that about anybody!
Miss Bu: Not so! These are specific truths I have clearly discerned about your individual fortune...
Miss Bu: ...
Miss Bu: ...I said too much in one go, didn't I?
Miss Bu: Lesson learnt. I'll know for next time.
 What legend?
Miss Bu: Why, the legend of the conch lodge. It's very popular among the young people of Liyue.
Miss Bu: ...You can hear the sound of the sea in a conch shell. The same is true of the conch lodge...
Miss Bu: Only, the sounds heard here come not from the ocean blue... but from the Sea of Souls.
Miss Bu: If somebody hears sounds from the conch lodge, it could well mean that—
Miss Bu: Sorry! I didn't mean to scare you...
 Is that legend real?
Miss Bu: Why, experience would be a better teacher than I, wouldn't you say?
Miss Bu: Take this starconch with you. Place this to your ear when you're alone...
Miss Bu: Perhaps you'll really hear something. Hehe...
(Obtain  Starconch ×3)
 Goodbye.
Miss Bu: Don't you want to hear what Miss Bu has for you? You're no fun.
