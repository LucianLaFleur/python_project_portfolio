Idle Quotes[]

 ...You buying or not?
Media:VO Jifang 01.ogg "So, are you buying or not?"

Dialogue[]

Jifang: Found one you like? Please pay over here.
 I'm looking to buy some books.
Jifang: Pick them out yourself. When you find one you like, pay here.
(Opens Wanwen Bookhouse shop)
 Adventure Challenge
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Jifang: Hmph, that's what I think about when nobody's buying books. I won't let you win that easily.
(If the player wins the match)

Jifang: How could this be...
 I want to know about the Wanwen Bookhouse.
Jifang: Strange, most people who come here are looking for books, not the bookhouse itself...
Jifang: Anyway, my husband is the one with a bit of a thing for collecting old books. But he doesn't earn any money...
Jifang: That's why I opened this place. Got to make a living somehow.
 Any recommended reads?
Jifang: Let's see... If you like poetry, Humor From Tianheng is selling well at the moment. Seems to have a mass appeal.
Jifang: If you're a visitor in town, you might enjoy Records of Jueyun. It's not for the faint-hearted, tough.
 "Records of Jueyun"?
Jifang: You seem like you could handle it. See what you think of this one: Records of Jueyun - Stone Beasts.
Jifang: Take it with you if you want. Just bring it back when you get sick of it.
Jifang: ...I won't hold my breath, though, I've had plenty of customers who borrow books and don't return them.
(Obtain  Records of Jueyun - Vol. I, Stone Beasts)
 Goodbye.
Jifang: Typical. You sit there reading the book in-store, then as soon as I ask if you want to buy it you're all, "Oh, I'm just browsing" and "Oh, I might come back tomorrow..."

Event Dialogue[]
Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness[]

 We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.
Jifang: A music festival, you say? You know, I actually met my husband because of a song. Quite the coincidence, eh?
Paimon: Ooh! Which song was it? Bet we can play it for you — we're super serious about music!
Jifang: Oh, in that case, could you play it if I were to hum the tune?
 Sure, I'll give it a go.
Jifang: Haha, how exciting!
(After performing)
Jifang: What a wonderfully nostalgic feeling. I was immediately reminded of my studies in Fontaine.
Jifang: I would often go to cafes in Vasari Passage to read, and when I heard this song one day, I asked the barista what it was called.
Jifang: They didn't know, but a large fellow having some cake nearby told me that it was named "Le Souvenir avec le crepuscule." And yeah, later on, he became my husband.
Jifang: He was at the cafe meeting with his friends from a literary club back then. Ah, how nostalgic. We were all so young!
Jifang: Oh, right! Your music festival... I fear I shan't be able to attend, but if needed, I can get my husband to go.
Jifang: He's been fiddling with some old books that haven't been selling well all day, and I haven't been able to dissuade him from doing so.
Jifang: But I'm sure such cultural exchanges would interest him. I'll ask him to bring some souvenirs along that he can give out to boot.
(Talk to Jifang again, optional)
 How was that?
(Same as After performing)
