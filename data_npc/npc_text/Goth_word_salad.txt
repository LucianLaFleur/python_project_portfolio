Goth's location (Daytime)Additional context
Profile[]
Goth is the owner and manager of the Goth Grand Hotel, Dawn Breeze Inn, and landlord of a few other housing accommodations in the city. The Goth family has a long and proud heritage of serving the people of Mondstadt. They have been involved in the hotel and catering industry, serving personal and business guests.
He has a son named Marvin. He opposes his betrothal to Marla, causing Marvin to sneak off to Starsnatch Cliff at nighttime to spend time with her.
Prior to the Traveler's arrival to Mondstadt, Goth accepted a deal with the Harbinger Pantalone to rent out the entire hotel for the Fatui indefinitely; while he was upset at not being able to accommodate anyone else, the Harbinger had offered him a large sum of Mora that he couldn't refuse.
During Mona's Story Quest, Goth is also revealed to be the owner of a house in the city that had been locked up with a Hydro seal. After Mona was forced to stay in Mondstadt to avoid incurring her master's wrath for accidentally reading her personal diary, they are referred to the house by Katheryne. As Mona dispels the seal, Goth appears and thanks Mona, allowing her to rent the place at an "affordable" price.

Dialogue[]

Goth: Excuse me, (‍sirsirText for Aether/ma'amma'amText for Lumine‍)? ...Oh, er, I mean hey there, friend! Sorry, I was in work mode, please excuse my bad manners.
 So, know a thing or two about furnishings?
(After completing A Teapot to Call Home)
Goth: I was originally planning to renovate the hotel, but then the Fatui booked the whole place out. Now I no longer have any needs for these blueprints... Take a look, maybe you'll find one you like.
 About Stormterror...
(After completing A Long Shot)
Goth: To be frank, the Fatui's actions are more concerning to me than those of Stormterror.
Goth: Whenever I pass by, they always seem to be having some sort of meeting. They've even chased all the staff in charge of cleaning their accommodations away...
Goth: What are they planning? I do hope that they aren't hatching some nefarious plot. It will bring the name of the Goth Grand Hotel down for sure...
Goth: Well, never mind. They paid in full, at the very least.
 Who are you?
Goth: I'm Ludwig, but all my friends in the city call me "Goth."
Goth: Goth is my family name. The Goth family has a long, proud heritage serving the people of Mondstadt.
Goth: From the Dawn Breeze Inn to the latest and greatest addition, the Goth Grand Hotel, the Goth family have been involved in the hotel and catering industry serving personal and business guests right from the start.
Goth: We might not be as illustrious as the Gunnhildr family, who defend Mondstadt against invasion, but even so each member of the Goth family is proud of the work we do.
 Tell me about the Goth Grand Hotel.
Goth: The Goth Grand Hotel is part of the Goth family's hotel enterprise. I am the owner and manager.
Goth:  But whatever your requirements are right now, the Goth Grand Hotel will be unable to accommodate them in the short term.
Goth: The reason is that not long ago, the Fatui booked out the entire premises indefinitely.
Goth: If you ask me why... It seems they were dissatisfied with the accommodation provided to them by the Knights of Favonius. I suppose that says something about the luxuriousness of the Goth Grand Hotel... Heh.
Goth: This whole business actually runs contrary to the Goths' spirit of service to the people of Mondstadt... But Master Pantalone of the Fatui offered an unbelievably generous amount for the booking, it was difficult to refuse...
 What other business does your family do?
(Before completing Mona's Story Quest)
Goth: Apart from the hotel, we also offer rental accommodation. It's more cost-effective for longer-term visitors.
Goth: But we don't have any vacancies right now. Since the Fatui booked out the whole hotel, demand for rented accommodation has soared.
Goth: Speaking of vacancies... Technically, we do have one place still available. But someone went and locked the door with some kind of seal, and now it won't open. We can't exactly rent it out when the tenant won't be able to get inside...
Goth: All this is to say that if you're looking to rent, the best I can offer is to put a word in with the folks who deal with that side of things, ask them to keep an eye out for you.
 Tell me about the magic laboratory.
(After completing Mona's Story Quest)
Goth: It's finally being put to use again, thanks to that astrologer.
Goth: The only issue is that the equipment takes up a lot of space. Which is fine if you're just working in there, but not if you want to sleep and eat there too.
Goth: I was going to recommend somewhere more spacious to her, but she flat-out dismissed the idea. "It's easier to focus one's energy in difficult circumstances," she said.
 Goodbye.
Goth: Take care. I'll get back to enjoying my holiday then!

Event Dialogue[]
Invitation of Windblume[]

Goth: Excuse me, (‍sirsirText for Aether/ma'amma'amText for Lumine‍)? ...Oh, er, I mean hey there, friend! Why, this work mode of mine... So, care for a chat?
 About the Windblume Festival...
Goth: Oh, my, if it isn't the Windblume Festival again. The youth of the city have come out to play.
Goth: Haha. I wonder what flower shall be offered up to the Anemo Archon this year? Will it still be a Dandelion?
Goth: When I was a young man, I used to enjoy debating the identity of the Windblume as well. I was quite the dyed-in-the-wool Dandelionite.
Goth: Come to think of it, my wife and I met during the Windblume Festival. It was truly love at first sight...
Goth: *sigh* How the years have gone by since then...
 I've got other things to attend to.
Goth: I see. Be careful out there.

Trivia[]
The Honkai: Star Rail NPC Old Goethe is an allusion to Goth. Both go by their family names instead of their first names, and their family business is hoteliering. In Star Rail, while Old Goethe personally runs the Overworld's Goethe Hotel, the Goethe family's Underground branch runs a hotel called the Goethe Grand Hotel.
Etymology[]
The surname Goth is the anglicized form of the German surname Göth, a variant of Goethe. The family name is best remembered by the poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
The Chinese version in fact uses the transcription of Goethe, not Goth. The Japanese and Russian localizations follow it.
