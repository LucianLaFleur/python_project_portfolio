Sybilla, also known as the Golden Bee and the prophet, is a historical character from Fontaine, most closely associated with Remus and the nation of Remuria.
Originally an envoy tasked with guarding the Irminsul tree in an ancient city located in what later became the High Seas, Sybilla's form and mind were worn down until she remained in the form of a golden bee. Remus discovered her in this state after accidentally entering the city's ruins, and she departed with him to establish Remuria.[1]

Profile[]
As a former envoy, Sybilla had prophetic powers which allowed her to foretell Remus and Remuria's future. Though she played a major role in building Remuria's prosperity and later sacrificed her life for the sake of creating Phobos, Remus' Grand Symphony,[2] her lack of a will ultimately caused the project to fail, as her vague desire to "grant happiness to all in the world who are called humans" caused Phobos to attempt to satisfy "everyone's" desires — including destructive and selfish ones — and set Remuria towards the course of its self-destruction.[3]

Story[]
Sybilla was an envoy who survived the "last deluge that swallowed the earth,"[4] remaining inside an ancient city and continuing to protect its silver-white tree. This lasted for an unknown duration of time until Remus accidentally discovered the city's ruins.[1]
