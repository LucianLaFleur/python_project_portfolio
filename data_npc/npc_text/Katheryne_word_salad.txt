Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild.—Katheryne, upon greeting the player
Katheryne is the receptionist for the Adventurers' Guild. She can be found at the Guild's headquarters located in each of Teyvat's seven nations, indicated by the  icon on the map.

Multiple, identical Katherynes exist, all serving as the Guild's receptionists. It is unknown if they have separate wills and memories, as dialogue in the Archon Quest Chapter II: Act IV - Requiem of the Echoing Depths implies the Katheryne seen in Liyue has a connection with the one the Traveler meets in Inazuma. She is confirmed to be a bionic Snezhnayan puppet at the end of the Archon Quest Dawn in Chapter III: Act II - The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings: Denouement.[5]

Mondstadt[]

Media:VO Katheryne Dialogue 01.ogg Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild.
 Who are you?
Katheryne: I am Katheryne, the receptionist here at the Adventurers' Guild.
Katheryne: It's my job to assign quests to Mondstadt's adventurers and provide intelligence support.
Katheryne: The Adventurers' Guild is open for business all year round.
 What does the Adventurers' Guild do?
Katheryne: The Adventurers' Guild is an organization that was set up to support all of Teyvat's adventurers, all across the seven nations.
Katheryne: We provide a platform to help newcomers adjust to the adventurer lifestyle, while also supporting veteran adventurers and allowing them to adventure more freely...
Katheryne: The Guild collates all the complex word-of-mouth information it receives and redistributes it in the form of quests and adventures assigned to adventurers.

Liyue[]

Media:VO Katheryne Dialogue 01.ogg Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild.
 ...Katheryne?
Katheryne: That's right. I am Katheryne, the receptionist here at the Adventurers' Guild.
Katheryne: It's my job to assign quests to our adventurers and provide intelligence support. Our service is all year round.
Katheryne: Is there something wrong, Adventurer? You seem... surprised?
 ...What are you doing here?
Katheryne: I'm sorry, I don't quite understand your confusion?
Katheryne: All Guild members should be well aware that Katheryne is the receptionist of the Adventurers' Guild. The Liyue branch can't go without a receptionist, can it?
Katheryne: Therefore, Katheryne is here.
Katheryne: ...Do you have any further questions?

Inazuma[]

Media:VO Katheryne Dialogue 01.ogg Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild.
 Why, hello there...?
Katheryne: Hello, I am Katheryne, the receptionist of the Adventurers' Guild. My job is to provide the adventurers with quests and intelligence support.
Katheryne: This service is available around the clock, so there is no need for concern.
 Another Katheryne...
Katheryne: Another? Hehe, have you ever seen more than one Katheryne at once?
Katheryne: If not, you have probably seen the same me each time. To meet the demands of the adventurers from all over the world, I use a special tool to teleport myself and work in multiple places simultaneously.
 I'd love to teleport, too!
Katheryne: Oh dear, you actually believed that?
Katheryne: Sorry, that was a joke. Please don't take it to heart.
Katheryne: In any case, you probably know how to use the Teleport Waypoints, right?

Sumeru[]

Media:VO Katheryne Dialogue 01.ogg Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild.
 Katheryne, it's you again!
Katheryne: Hello, it is indeed me, Katheryne, the receptionist of the Adventurers' Guild. My job is to provide the adventurers with quests and intelligence support.
Katheryne: Since it looks like you're already familiar with the Adventurers' Guild's modus operandi, I'll leave it at that.
 Have you been following me this whole time?
Katheryne: Hehe, if all expenses are covered, I won't refuse.
Katheryne: But unfortunately, being a receptionist is a year-round job, so I don't get vacation opportunities like that.
(Unlocked after completing The Gaze From a Certain God)
 How are you feeling now, Katheryne?
Katheryne: How am I feeling? ...Was I unwell?
Katheryne: I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that I can't quite remember what happened before... But since I'm here, I suppose it was no trouble in the end.
 (So Katheryne doesn't remember... Has the previous puppet been replaced?)

Fontaine[]

Media:VO Katheryne Dialogue 01.ogg Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild.
 We meet again, Katheryne.
Katheryne: Hello there. The pleasure is mine.
Katheryne: I am Katheryne, the receptionist of the Adventurers' Guild. My job is to provide the adventurers with quests and intelligence support.
Katheryne: May my services be of help to you, and may your journey in Fontaine be a memorable one.
 Are you also a clockwork puppet, Katheryne?
Katheryne: Haha. I wonder?
Katheryne: Do I appear like a masterpiece of the Fontaine Research Institute to some?

Trivia[]
"Ad Astra Abyssosque," which she always says when you first speak to her, is Latin for "To the Stars and the Abyss."
Before confirmation of her identity as a bionic Snezhnayan puppet by Nahida,[5] it was highly implied that she may be an android, or some other kind of artificial being, based on her idle quotes (i.e., where she robotically says "Error" and "Rebooting"), identical appearance regardless of location, and a keyhole-shaped embellishment on the back of her collar.
Katheryne bears a strong resemblance to the Fatui Harbinger, Sandrone. Considering Sandrone's interest in mechanical research, and Katheryne being of Snezhnayan origin, this may mean that Sandrone was involved in Katheryne's creation.
Katheryne is mentioned in the description of the following Furnishing: Errands in the City of Wisdom
