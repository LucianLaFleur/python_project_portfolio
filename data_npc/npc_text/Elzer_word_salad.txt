Elzer's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Elzer served the Dawn Winery while Crepus was still alive, and says that the man was like a father to him. For that reason, after Crepus' tragic death, Elzer decided to assume most of the Winery's affairs while Diluc, in his grief and rage, eventually departed from Mondstadt and left the Winery to Elzer and Adelinde.
Since then, Elzer has become the Executive Chairman of the Mondstadt Wine Guild. Upon learning about Diona's talent for mixing drinks, which resulted in a massive popularity boost at Cat's Tail, Elzer attempted to headhunt her to Angel's Share. Unfortunately for him, he was unaware of Diona's hatred of alcohol — and the attempt ended with him getting bitten.
Elzer is one of the few who is aware that Diluc is the rumored "Darknight Hero."

Dialogue[]

Elzer: Oh? Distinguished guest, may I ask, are you here to discuss business?
 Who are you?
Elzer: I am Elzer. Under his grace, when the master of the house is away, I take care of the most major affairs.
Elzer: Master Diluc... Does not tend to worry himself too much with the affairs of the winery.
Elzer: So, whatever business you are here to discuss, is probably best discussed with me directly.
 You have another identity, don't you?
Elzer: My, you have a keen eye for detail.
Elzer: It is true that my other role is Chief Executive of the Mondstadt Wine Appreciation Guild.
Elzer: But I do not do it for appearances, nor do I seek to hide it, my liege.
Elzer: The simple fact is that given Dawn Winery's standing in Mondstadt...
Elzer: There is barely any distinction to be made between managing the affairs of the winery and managing the affairs of the whole industry.
 Tell me about your past.
Elzer: My past? That's something I can talk freely about.
Elzer: I trust you know of the winery's former owner, Master Crepus? He was Diluc's father.
Elzer: Master Crepus was like a father to me, too.
Elzer: He was in the prime of his life at the time of his tragic accident all those year ago...
Elzer: Master Diluc spent a long time grieving. It was during that time that I started taking care of some of the winery's affairs.
Elzer: I thought that rather than be overcome by sorrow, it was better for me to share some of Master Diluc's load. It was also the only thing I could do.
Elzer: Thought it was a little presumptuous of me to act beyond my role, I do think perhaps that's what Master Crepus would have liked to see.
Elzer: *sigh* Sorry, that got a bit deep and depressing, didn't it.
 Goodbye.
Elzer: Farewell, honored guest. Please come again.
