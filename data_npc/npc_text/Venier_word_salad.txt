Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available after completing Trial of the Nameless Stone Statue and before completing Canticles of Harmony.


Venier: A hundred and thirty-six... Alright, fourteen more times, and we'll take a break!
 What are you doing?
Venier: Hehe, training, of course! Only through constant exercise of the body and soul can I defend this city and destroy the detestable barbarian invaders.
Venier: And at the same time, prove myself to the Sebastos as worthy of ascension!
 Eligibility of ascension, you say?
Venier: That's right. Those who wish to ascend must either possess extraordinary musical talent, or have proven themselves through equally outstanding achievements and loyalty.
Venier: I've not demonstrated much musically in my life, so I can only secure ascension through ceaseless training!
 I wish you success!
Venier: Haha, thank you for the encouragement, friend! I, too, wish for the Sebastos to choose you to ascend to immortal form!
 Goodbye.
Venier: See you. Careful out there, now!

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Canticles of Harmony.


Venier: So tired... My arm hurts... It's like someone hit it, or something.
 Would anyone dare to fight you?
Venier: Ah, my friend! Where did you learn to judge a book by its cover so?
Venier: I am a musician, you see! These arms are most elegant when they pluck a lyre's strings, I assure you.
Venier: Although I do not know why, though I was exhausted after waking up from a lengthy dream, my arms now feel like they have been granted manifold strength.
Venier: I've never been this tired, not even when I would play the lyre without rest or sleep.
Venier: It seems that I shall have to return to Capitolium to get some rest...
 What's the Capitolium?
Venier: Capitolium? Why, it's... it's... Wait. Where is it again?
Venier: Strange. Why did that word suddenly leave my lips? It's as if it was my hometown, where my family is.
Venier: *sigh* Alas, but I no longer have any family.
Venier: If this Capitolium is some dream world or the afterlife, may I reunite with them there!
 Sorry for your loss...
Venier: Grief will not simply disappear. We can only let it slowly fade.
Venier: I once thought the world unjust for this reason, but will any amount of that change the past?
Venier: The more I can commit to the Iridescence Tour, the fewer opportunities there will be for sorrow.
Venier: Perhaps Dvorak, bless his good heart, was just trying to help me get on my feet when he asked for my assistance with the festival!
 Could you tell me about your family?
(Unlocked after completing Transcription missing‍[Possibly As Light Rain Falls Without Reason])

Venier: My daughter inherited my musical gifts, and we were to perform at the Opera Epiclese together.
Venier: But I... lost her in the dissolved young women case...
 Goodbye.
Venier: Goodbye. Sorry, but I can't even... wave goodbye to you properly.
