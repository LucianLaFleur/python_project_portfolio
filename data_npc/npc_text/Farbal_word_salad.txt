Event Dialogue[]

(Before completing Opening Festivities)
Farbal: *sigh* Everyone's just too sensitive about academic issues. It's just a toy. Come on...

(After completing Gathering of Stars)
Farbal: I wish the older students would stop coming over to ask. This really, truly is just a toy.
Farbal: Ah? Oh... It's you, Traveler. Would you like to play a round or two of "Gathering of Stars"?
 I'd like to give this a try.
Farbal: Sure. The astrolabe is over here.
 I've got other things to do right now, sorry.
Farbal: Well, I'll be here at the booth throughout the Gala. If you're of a mind to play, just hit me up.
