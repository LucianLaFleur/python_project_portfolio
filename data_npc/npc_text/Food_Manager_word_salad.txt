Dialogue[]

Food Manager: (A Hydro Eidolon that seems to be up to something in the corner. According to Chief Director, its nickname is "Food Manager.")
Food Manager: (But... isn't that a bit strange? What do Hydro Eidolons even eat? Or maybe... it's responsible for feeding those ghost mechanisms?)
