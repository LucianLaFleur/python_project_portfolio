Appearance[]
Sanada wears a standard uniform modeled from the ashigaru (Japanese: 足軽) of feudal Japan. He wears a purple-gray shitagi, gray kobakama, white socks, and waraji sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with gray accents consists of dou (breastplate) with the Inazuma Shogunate's crest, han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves). He is equipped with a juumonji yari (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead.

Dialogue[]

Sanada: Ah, why am I the only one left here again... Hello, how can I help you?
 The only one left?
Sanada: I have a comrade who was supposed to stand on guard with me, but he always abandons his post. If I don't pay special attention, he tends to just leave me on duty here alone.
Sanada: I'm debating if I should report this to our superior...
 You should report him.
Sanada: If this gets out, everyone will think that I'm a snitch. What if they ostracize me from now on because of that?
Sanada: I don't want to have a bad reputation at the Police Station. It will affect my chances for a promotion...
 Best keep it to yourself...
Sanada: But what if there is trouble? How am I supposed to handle it myself?
Sanada: I have to patrol this whole area. This is too difficult. Ah, so annoying...
 Have you ever seen someone who looks like me?
Sanada: I can't really say. There are way too many people coming in and out of Hanamizaka. And I'm usually the only one on duty. How can I possibly remember that?
Sanada: Gee, can't people just do their job properly...
 Goodbye.
Sanada: Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign! Let me think...
