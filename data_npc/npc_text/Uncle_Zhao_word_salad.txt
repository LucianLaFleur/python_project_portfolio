Dialogue[]

Uncle Zhao: It's as I thought. We're missing another one tonight...
 You were saying?
Uncle Zhao: You heard? Well, it's nothing. It's just that we're missing another one of our regular customers.
Uncle Zhao: They... probably disappeared.
Uncle Zhao: Nonetheless, there's no need to think much of it. Someone new will be introduced to this place soon, anyway.
 What do you mean, "disappeared"?
Uncle Zhao: Exactly what it says on the label. They've disappeared from the face of Liyue.
Uncle Zhao: Some guests will party lavishly one day, and then be gone without a trace the next — as if they never existed at all.
Uncle Zhao: I've served as a guard on board this ship for over a decade now. Such occurrences are hardly new.
Uncle Zhao: This Pearl Galley is dazzling to gaze upon, but there won't even be bones left by the time it's done picking you clean.
Uncle Zhao: If you've nothing else to do, don't stick around these parts. Eyes on the prize, traveler.
 Goodbye.
Uncle Zhao: Mm, see you.
