Dialogue[]

Bhabha: I wonder if my friends from when I was young are doing alright now...
 And you are...
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Bhabha: I'm just an old-timer with too much free time on his hands. Not like before.
Bhabha: I once crossed the rainforest and the desert when I was young. I adventured all over Teyvat, saw plenty of things, and made many friends...
Bhabha: I didn't have much money then, but what I did have was vigor and courage.
Bhabha: Then... Then I happened to dig up some treasure on one of my adventures. Some people said it was a fairy's treasure, while others said it was the legacy of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata...
Bhabha: I was just a kid then who didn't know any better, so I sold it to the highest bidder.
Bhabha: Thanks to that income, I'm able to clothe and feed myself even in my old age, hehe.
 You are...

Bhabha: Then... Then I happened to dig up something precious on one of my adventures. Some people said it was one of the treasures of the spirits, and some said that it must be a relic of the Dendro Archon...

 Your friends from when you were young?
Bhabha: I was an energetic and tireless adventure in my youth. I may have gotten myself into my fair share of trouble, but that's also how I made friends.
Bhabha: I remember that lad Roald would lose things all over the place. I once lent him shoes, notebooks, and a mountaineering pickaxe... before he lost them all, that is.
Bhabha: And there was that chatterbox... Cyrus? Was that his name? He had a booming voice, like to go on and on and on, but would never listen to what anyone else had to say...
Bhabha: I hear he's the branch master of the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild now, and that he's got a beautiful daughter.
Bhabha: I suppose that means he's grown up a fair bit now, that's good...
 See you.
Bhabha: Safe travels.
