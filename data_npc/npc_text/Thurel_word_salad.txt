 I can't believe it...

Dialogue[]

Thurel: My, oh my. How many years have I been retired again?
 What were you working as before?
Thurel: I was previously with the Gardes, and later, my technique with a gun saw me join the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol for a time.
Thurel: Still later, I switched departments several times. I no longer remember what happened exactly.
Thurel: *sigh* The older I get, the less able I am to remember things that happened recently...
Thurel: The thing that left the deepest impression, surprisingly, was the job I was at the shortest — that happened when I was sent underwater as a guard by the Palais Mermonia.
 By underwater, you mean. [sic]
Thurel: Yes, I refer to the Fortress of Meropide.
Thurel: Well, it is true that those who have never been there would never use such terms as "above water" or "underwater" in that fashion. Few guards sent down there last very long.
Thurel: The environment there really cannot be called good, and there are conflicts between gangs of criminals, too, so we don't integrate well.
Thurel: I've heard that a new manager was appointed who laid down a great number of new rules that have made the guards' jobs much easier.
Thurel: But I'd long transferred out by then — Guess you could say that the timings didn't match up.
 Do you need help counting?
Thurel: Haha, no, no, I'm just reflecting on certain realities, that's all. Thank you.
