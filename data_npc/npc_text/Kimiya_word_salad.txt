 I don't get it...

Media:VO Kimiya All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Kimiya: (Is there really no future for Alchemical Divination?)
Dialogue[]

Kimiya: Is this interpretation based on...
 May I use the Crafting Bench here?
Kimiya: Ah, sure, go ahead. I was thinking about something else anyways...

(If the player loses the match)

Kimiya: I won, haha! If only I could perform divination using Genius Invokation TCG cards...
(If the player wins the match)

Kimiya: Well... Is this what the bad omen that I read today meant?
 What are you doing?
Kimiya: Lately, I've been studying something called "Alchemical Divination."
Kimiya: You rely on intuition to randomly choose some things to conduct alchemy on. If it fails — and, of course, most of the time it does fail — the ashes are used in divination.
Kimiya: It's pretty much the same principle as divination of coffee grounds or leftover tea leaves.
Kimiya: I've noticed that the girls in my class are really interested in that sort of thing, so there's no reason that Alchemical Divination shouldn't be just as popular, right?
(Before Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

 Is this a personal interest or is it purely academic?
Kimiya: Ahem... Can't it both?
Kimiya: My mentor kept shaking their head after I said that according to legend, Alchemical Divination was invented by Lesser Lord Kusanali. But I don't think it's time to give up yet.
Kimiya: I just need to workout the rationale for this interpretation, even the tiniest one. Then I can go back and discuss it with my mentor!
(After Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

 Is this interest personal or academic?
Kimiya: Ahem... Can't it both?
Kimiya: When I said that "legends hold that this was invented by Lesser Lord Kusanali," my mentor did have a doubtful look, but I didn't get rejected outright, so I reckon that it's too early to give up yet!
Kimiya: I just need to work out some rationale for this interpretation, even if it's a flimsy one. Then I can go back and discuss it with my mentor!
 See you.
Kimiya: Ugh, but why?
