Dialogue[]

Cornelia: Hello there. Where are you going, if I might ask?
 I—I'm just looking around...
Cornelia: Ah, so you're just a visiting guest.
Cornelia: My apologies, I thought you were a citizen here on business.
Cornelia: Since I've been placed here closest to the gate, people always ask me for directions.
 That sounds like a tough job.
Cornelia: It's fine. I don't think so.
Cornelia: Interaction brings color to an otherwise ordinary life, and it helps to make your mind more agile.
Cornelia: The longer you work here, the more you realize how important this agility is.
 I shan't bother you, then.
Cornelia: See you, in that case.
