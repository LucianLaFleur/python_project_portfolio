Dialogue[]

Khayyam: Hello, child! How can I help?
 About Irfan...
Khayyam: Oh, him... We are childhood friends. He went to Port Ormos and became a merchant, then got married and lived well...
Khayyam: I haven't had drinks and talked with him in a long time... We didn't get to see each other before he died a few years ago...
 About Siman...
Khayyam: ...
Khayyam: Hm...? Oh, her...
Khayyam: "The child born in the middle of sands cherishes green more than anyone else." This sentence probably is about her...
Khayyam: She should have followed in her father's footsteps and become a mercenary, adventuring in the vast desert... But she chose the path of a researcher.
Khayyam: She was born cut out for a mercenary, through and through. To achieve her goals, she'd act regardless of the cost or the consequences, even her own life...
Khayyam: I tried to understand her, but I was too young, and it turned out quite unpleasant... So, it is as you see. We have been apart for many years... many decades, actually.
Khayyam: I hope she is doing well.
 About the medical history... (Only available after interacting with the Medical History of Giyath Khayyam)
Khayyam: Medical history? Medical history...
Khayyam: Oh! You saw it? My medical history?
Khayyam: Haha... You saw it, huh... You saw it.
Khayyam: They said I would forget everything in the end. I would forget everything I learned in my life, forget my best friend... everyone and everything.
Khayyam: When that day comes, I will lose my memory, my everything, my sense of being alive. Then I'll forget why I exist. I am destined to be like that... sooner or later...
Khayyam: So until then, at least until then... I want to do what I want. Just stay in the place I want to die in.
Khayyam: Forgetting cannot stop my steps, and neither can Siman...
 Goodbye.
Khayyam: Haha, don't let me keep you for too long, child!

Trivia[]
His name likely derives from the poet Omar Khayyam, whose poetry he quotes in Aranaga's Memory.
