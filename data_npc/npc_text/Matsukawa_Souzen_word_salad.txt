Dialogue[]

(Before completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
Matsukawa Souzen: *sigh* ...Hello, do you need something?
 You seem upset.
Matsukawa Souzen: As an officer with a duty towards Inazuma, I should naturally be upset about the current state of the nation.
Matsukawa Souzen: *sigh* ...When I think about the endless fighting between the Shogunate and the rebels, I can't even sleep or eat.
Matsukawa Souzen: If it keeps going on like this, Inazuma's finances will continue to worsen with each passing day. It's only a matter of time before it starts to affect the lives of the people...
Matsukawa Souzen: I hope that Her Excellency can act soon and fix the situation from the root of the problem herself...
 Goodbye.
Matsukawa Souzen: *sigh* ...Goodbye.
(After completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
Matsukawa Souzen: *sigh* ...Hello, do you need something?
 Something seems to be troubling you.
Matsukawa Souzen: Inazuma has just gone through a series of changes. A new era is coming.
Matsukawa Souzen: To be honest, all this has made me too busy to have time for anything else, but I don't think that this is a bad thing, necessarily.
Matsukawa Souzen: Her Excellency has seems to have had something of a change of mood. I can only hope that...
Matsukawa Souzen: Ah, I shall not speak of this now. Whatever the case, our work in clearing our accounts is far busier than usual. Perhaps we can chat again some other time.
 Goodbye.
Matsukawa Souzen: Indeed. Farewell.
