Profile[]
Nelson enjoys eating cat food, and no matter how much he is fed, he will still get excited at the sight of food. The customers at the tavern forget about their drinks after seeing him. They all love him, and fight over who gets to feed him. Diona suspects that he pretends to be hungry to get taken care of by the customers.[1]

His full name was Prince Rogers Nelson and Paisley Park is the name of his recording studio/residence and one of his songs. Margaret, the owner of the Cat's Tail, also owns another cat named Prince.
