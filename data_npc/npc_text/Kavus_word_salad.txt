 About Aranara...
Kavus: No... I won't say anything... We agreed to keep it a secret, even from (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
 About the tale of the giant sea serpent...
Kavus: Yes, the giant sea serpent in (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)'s story sounds amazing. But there's nothing more to it now that it's already been taken down.

 I've got other things to do right now...

Kavus: Let's play with Rana once she gets back!
 Take good care of Sudabeh and Iotham.
Kavus: I will. I'm gonna be a good big brother, and I'll never leave them behind! Otherwise, Rana will criticize me.

Kavus: Um... By the way, Sudabeh said recently she's been learning to cook on her own so that she can be a big girl soon. So if you happen to eat something suspicious she made... well... please don't be hard on her, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!

 About Aranara...

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
Kavus' name may be derived from Kay Kāvus, a mythological Persian king who is best known for building a flying throne, on which he managed to fly all the way over to China before the vultures carrying his throne became too tired to fly and dropped him and his throne.
