Story[]
Early life[]
Arundolyn was born from a long line of knights and formed a friendship with Rostam based on their shared dream of heroism.[1] At one point he and Rostam snuck out at night into the wolves' forest, chasing boars with slingshots and fighting imaginary monsters with sticks. They followed a seelie and found treasure that had been buried for a thousand years, a small yellow flower. Another time they went into the forest acting out the battle between Vennessa and the champion knight of the Aristocracy, fighting each other with sticks and toy swords until Arundolyn won and they acted out the fall of the aristocracy.[2]
As young men, they became fellow knights[1] and Arundolyn used a greatsword modeled off the one wielded by Ravenwood, the Knight of Boreas.[3]

Later life[]
Arundolyn was given the lion title and became the Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, while his friend Rostam gained the wolf title and supported him from the shadows as his assistant. The two of them defended their home and each other during those turbulent times.[1][2]
Eventually the Kingdom of Khaenri'ah fell during the cataclysm, with black curses pouring forth and roots of disaster infesting the earth. Arundolyn led his knights on an expedition to fight the monsters that threatened Teyvat, spilling black ichor from their enemies with their swords.[2] Unfortunately Rostam died during the expedition to Khaenri'ah, leaving Arundolyn inconsolable, and he gave up both his title of Grand Master and his weapons.[1]
He returned to his childhood home and looked through the belongings from his first adventures, finding the yellow flower as the only thing in his life that was unchanged since his childhood.[2] It is unclear how he spent the rest of his life or how he died.

Legacy[]
His particular style of swordsmanship died out due to it requiring great strength to wield both a greatsword and longsword at once.[1]

Trivia[]
Ferrous Shadow is a replica of Arundolyn's greatsword, which itself was a replica of the greatsword wielded by Ravenwood, a Knight of Boreas.[3]
The Brave Heart artifact set descriptions talks about Arundolyn and his friendship with Rostam.
