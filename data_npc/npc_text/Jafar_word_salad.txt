 The atmosphere here...

Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Jafar: Even researchers should have a life that's their own.
 Are you a researcher?
Jafar: I am, unfortunately.
Jafar: What is fortunate, however, is that I understand one thing better than the rest of my colleagues — research isn't the end-all and be-all of life.
Jafar: If you slog away at work all day, you'll get left behind in life, no matter how brilliant your research is.
Jafar: So, you've got to engage more with the people around you. Some drinking and chatting is the way to keep well, physically and mentally.
Jafar: Even if the price you pay is doing twice the work in the evenings. But you see, students are always coming to the office during the day to ask this and that, so I might as well do my research at night to get some peace and quiet.
 Take care of yourself.
Jafar: *sigh* I know, I know. But I just can't see myself spending my whole life on research.
Jafar: It's fine. I'll try to drink more milk and sleep better. The same goes for you.
(Obtain  Milk ×4)
 See you.
Jafar: Bye now. Keep in mind to enjoy your life!

Nighttime[]

Jafar: Let me think... How many days do I have before the deadline?
 The deadline?
Jafar: Yeah, that's the last day I can submit my paper.
Jafar: I'm a night owl whose mind only works sharply at night. That means I have 50% less research time than others.
Jafar: As for during the day, if you ask me, it'd be a waste not to go out and enjoy the warm sunshine.
Jafar: I always make some time to rest and relax. My mind would become too stiff to think straight if I focused on research every hour of every day.
Jafar: Enough chit-chat. I'm going to use the remaining 50% of my time efficiently. I have to come up with something before the deadline...
 I'll leave you to it, then.
Jafar: Hmm... It's not too bad. I still have enough time, I suppose...
