Profile[]
Jack is a novice member of the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild and a former member of Bennett's Adventure Team before leaving due to Bennett's contagious bad luck. While his family does not support his choice of becoming an adventurer, he tries his best and finds every opportunity to prove himself.[2] He greatly idolizes Cyrus and Stanley, taking their tall tales to heart.[3]

Appearance[]
Jack has short brown hair and green eyes. He carries a beige rucksack filled with leeks. Onion and garlic bulbs hangs by a rope tied to the side of the bag. He wears the standard male uniform of the Adventurers' Guild. The uniform consists of two layers of shirt (a long-sleeve white shirt with mandarin collar and a green laced up vest), a green dixie cap with a red cross on the left, green vambraces, a red necktie, a green cape collar with a ruffled trim and a triangular back flap, a buckled belt, knee-length green pants with red accents, brown stockings and laced leather shoes. The Adventurers' Guild logo, an eight-pointed star, is printed on the right and back flaps of the collar.

Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Jack: Hey! Are you a new adventurer? Wanna join my adventure team?
 About Stormterror...
(After completing ???)
Jack: To tell the truth, I was worried at first. But I was also excited.
Jack: This was my first time seeing a dragon. Just thinking that I might be able to face such a fearsome opponent gets me pumped up!
Jack: If I could finish a commission of that rank, I would definitely rise to prominence throughout the entire Adventurers' Guild.
Jack: *sigh* But as it stands, I can only take some commissions to clear out a few slimes here and there. I'm going to have a work a lot harder if I'm to take a dragon on...
 Tell me about yourself.
Jack: I'm Jack. Just Jack. No need to be formal with me, since we're all friends here.
Jack: I joined a few months ago, and people here helped me out lots.
Jack: Especially those stories! Oh, they are so exciting and always get me pumped up!
Jack: Hahaha... So far, I've only completed small commissions like clearing the sewers of a few slimes...
Jack: *sigh* When can I be like the others...
 Adventure team?
Jack: Yeah, people here usually band together in groups of four to go on adventures.
Jack: You seem to be in good company.
Jack: I once belonged to a rather nice brigade... But "Unlucky Bennett" was also there...
Jack: We all thought it was just a joke about him being "unlucky," but...
Jack: All the commissions he took on, somehow always failed in the least expected way...
Jack: Come to think of it, it is rather strange.
 Goodbye.
Jack: Ad astra abyssosque! May Lady Luck smiles upon you, friend.

Nighttime[]

Jack: Hey, I'm doing some adventurer's training... alcohol tolerance training, to be precise... Wanna join me?
 You seem to have had one too many.
Jack: Really? Let me see... eight beers, five wines, seven ciders... Not so much!
Jack: I'm no match for those legendary Mondstadt adventurers who can drink half of Cider Lake's worth of wine.
Jack: ...Only a figure of speech? Really? No wonder... I could never figure out how they could afford so much wine on an adventurer's income...
 What kind of liquor do you prefer?
Jack: Me...? Beer. I don't like it that much though...
Jack: It's just that... beggars can't be choosers...
Jack: As long as it gets me drunk, it's all good... Don't you agree?
 Goodbye.
Jack: Laters! Happy adventuring!
