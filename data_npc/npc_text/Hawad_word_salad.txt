(If the player loses the match)

Hawad: I won? Uh... Thanks for going easy on me, dear guest?
(If the player wins the match)

Hawad: You're really good! If I had your skills, I'd be able to talk business with just about anyone!
 You are...
Hawad: Hello, I'm a traveling merchant who sells desert specialties. Unfortunately, I only brought a few items with me this time, and they've been booked.
Hawad: But if you're interested, you can take a look for the moment.
 What are your best sellers?
Hawad: Ajilenakh Nuts have been the most in demand lately.
Hawad: Ajilenakh Nuts are a common crop that the people of the desert used to plant. They make pretty good desserts and candy because of their high sugar content.
Hawad: Sweets make people happy, so I guess that's where its popularity comes from.
Hawad: I heard researchers from the Akademiya are even trying to find out which type of light produces sweeter Ajilenakh Nuts. I really look forward to their results.
 What flower?
Hawad: Ah... I mean a girl from here. She is the flower of this place. I only have to look at her smile from a distance and I feel cleansed already.
Hawad: But I heard that she's gone to Sumeru City to look for her lover.
Hawad: What a pity... I don't even know her name...
 See you.
Hawad: See you.
