  Open-World NPCs 




Moco is an open-world NPC in Dawn Winery, Mondstadt. She can be seen with her fellow maid Hillie. In the morning, they can be found outside the winery; at night, they are found inside the winery.
The two are always found conversing with each other, and head maid Adelinde is often less-than-pleased with their work, which perhaps stems from their tendency to chatter. They have two versions of their dialogue, which play at random.

Dialogue[]
Version 1[]

Moco: D'you know what?
Hillie: No, what?
Moco: We have one less key than Adeline... uh-huh...
Hillie: *gasp* Does that mean... There's a secret room?
Moco: Right! You got it!
Moco: And so this one time, when I was waxing the floors, I noticed that right down the far end of the corridor on the second floor... there's a hidden room!
Hillie: Really!? So that's really the room that...?
Moco: Well. I crept up to the door and as soon as I got close, I heard this "thud... thud... thud" sound getting closer and closer!
Moco: I was like, sooo scared... and then just as I was about to run away... Adeline was behind me!
Hillie: Yikes!
Moco: The weirdest thing is that she didn't even tell me off; instead, she was all polite and asked me nicely to go back to my room...
Moco: But when I got back to my room, that's when I realized--
Moco: That thudding sound... it was exactly like how Adeline's boots sound when she walks!

Version 2[]

Moco: *gasp* No way... So that guest really?
Hillie: Totally! Shh...Not so loud!
Hillie: I was on duty that morning, and it seemed like no one had left.
Hillie: But I cleaned all the guest rooms on the second floor, and guess what I noticed? All the rooms were empty...
Moco: *gasp* No. Friggin'. Way! That's sooo creepy... So what happened then?
Hillie: Then I asked Adelinde... Like hey, what happened to the guest who arrived last night!?
Hillie: And she totally ignored me! She was just like, watering the flowers in the garden and talking to herself...
Moco: What was she saying?
Hillie: She was all like, "Next year when these flowers are in season they will look gorgeous."

Notes[]

↑ In Chinese, her line is better translated as "How terrifying!", which makes more sense with her and Hillie's dialogue.
