Dialogue[]

Lynn: Knowing how to cook is essential to survive in the wild, don't forget it!
 Who are you?
Lynn: I'm the Survival Expert of the Adventurers' Guild! Nice to meet you!
Lynn: I'm currently trying to complete the "Survive in the Wild" challenge. I don't even remember when I last set foot in Mondstadt...
Lynn: Actually, surviving in the wild isn't that hard, you just need to monitor your stamina, stay hydrated, and keep track of your temperature.
Lynn: Naturally, it's a bit lonely out there... So I appreciate our conversation.
 Tell me about cooking.
Lynn: Cooking is one of the most important skills needed in life! Don't skip the lesson!
Lynn: If there's a cooking pot on your way, you can try to cook some dishes you've learned.
Lynn: The food you've cooked does not only restore health, it can also grant you special bonuses.
Lynn: Of course, everything depends on your cooking skills, so learn your recipes!
 Tell me about ingredients.
Lynn: Collecting ingredients is all about using your talents as an adventurer!
Lynn: Harvest, hunt, or even find them in ordinary places! You're always in for a nice surprise!
Lynn: Too hard? How can you complain? We're talking about your own survival there!
Lynn: Okay, if you say so. There's a restaurant called "Good Hunter" in Mondstadt. They sell lots of ingredients, you can check it out.
 What if you can't find ingredients?
Lynn: Haha, it's at moments like these that you'll need the Teyvat Wilderness Survivalist's Recipes!
Lynn: This contains many summaries on how to whip up survival meals, even though it may be hard for some to accept...
Lynn: All in all, you should take a look at it if you have the time. Who knows, you might need it someday.

 Have you seen someone who looks very much like me?
Lynn: Oh. Well, I often help hungry adventurers by sharing a little something with them, so I might have seen the person that you want to find.
Lynn: Hmm, let me see. Well, your face does look familiar...
Lynn: Huh. Were you the one who had some barbecue lizard with me that other time?
Lynn: Speaking of which, you do look like that person I had chilled slime with! No, maybe you were the one with the frog soup...
Lynn: I... I'm sorry, I can only seem to remember the food I had with other people. I don't recall what they looked like very well...
 Goodbye.
Lynn: Remember to start your journey with a full stomach!
