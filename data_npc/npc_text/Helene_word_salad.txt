Dialogue[]

Helene: Even though they promised to help with the testing, I still feel a little on edge...
Helene: This restless feeling... Just as I thought, getting over my client-phobia won't be as simple as that!
 Are you alright?
Helene: Ah! You're back! I—I'm so sorry, I must have zoned out...
Helene: I've been thinking, is there really no way for me to escape the shadow of my clients?
Helene: Could it be that the only solution is, as you implied, to come up with a way of "getting rid" of my boss?
Helene: I—I need to think this over!
 About the stabilization platforms...
Helene: Huh? You, the miracle worker... You're interested in mechanical principles?
Helene: Actually, there isn't anything novel about the technology itself. I just happened to make some technical breakthroughs based on some previously abandoned research...
Helene: I've heard that there was a bunch of very talented engineers way back when... who wanted to make cannons that could fire stably even amidst towering waves.
Helene: To that end, they worked day and night to invent a device that could stabilize weaponry on a vertical axis.
Helene: Such projects were ultimately abandoned, sure, but I was able to restore the stabilizers based on some fragmentary documents.
Helene: After scaling it down, the end result was the current "Stabilization Mek."
Helene: I wonder whether there's really a market for this type of machine...
 (Quietly leave...)
Helene: Oh no, what am I going to do...
