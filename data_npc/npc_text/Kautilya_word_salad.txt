Profile[]
Kautilya is an Amurta researcher who was interested in Fungi, entering an agreement with Elchingen to host the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament. The tournament was actually a guise as he had discovered the "Capturing Device" and "Withering Potion", which were failed attempts to control dangerous monsters. He began to work on the experiment himself, modifying them into the Wisdom Orb and Floral Jelly. At the end of the tournament, he is arrested by the Matra for academic misconduct.
