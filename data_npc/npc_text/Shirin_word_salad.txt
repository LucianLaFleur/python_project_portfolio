 Look along the way...

Dialogue[]

Shirin: Lucky me! I've found another Nilotpala Lotus habitat.
 Are you picking Nilotpala Lotuses?
Shirin: Not yet, I'm just marking their locations for now.
Shirin: Nilotpala Lotuses are common medicinal plants, but they work best when they're fresh.
Shirin: As the Forest Rangers' doctor, I must do my best to mark areas rich with herbs so that I can pick them easily when they're needed.
Shirin: The rainforest may seem quiet, but its dangers cannot be underestimated. If you do enter the forest, try to stay on the main path and pay attention to your surroundings.
 I will.
Shirin: Okay. And on top of common emergency medicine, it's best to have a handy weapon.
Shirin: Something that can be used for hunting, or against monster attacks. Ranged weapons like bows are quite ideal. They're also a common choice for us Forest Rangers.
(Obtain  Recurve Bow)
 See you.
Shirin: Goodbye. Stay safe.
