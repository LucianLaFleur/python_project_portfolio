Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(If Hautemontagne is in Qiaoying Village)
Hautemontagne: I'm really enjoying this life...
 This is an order from Choiseul, Hautemontagne!
Hautemontagne: *cough* *coughing fit*
Hautemontagne: What are you doing, using his name? Don't scare me like that! I'm on the application side, so only Raimondo can fire me!
Hautemontagne: You got me good there. For a moment, I thought they needed people so badly that they'd sent someone to come kidnap me!
 Feeling guilty, aren't you?
Hautemontagne: Guilty? Nonsense. I'm here on official business! Look, Qiaoying Village sent someone to the Institute because they needed someone to repair something. The Institute couldn't find anyone, and when they noticed I was twiddling my thumbs in Lumidouce Harbor, they ultimately decided to send me...
Hautemontagne: Right, I know what you're going to ask next. I was working on applying the Multi-Phase Tuner to hydrology, so I'm more on the application side.
Hautemontagne: My head hurts just looking at the theoretical discussions. We don't get a lot of opportunities to be in the spotlight, but I'm satisfied just looking at my results being implemented and in operation.
Hautemontagne: Oops, I accidentally said things that I shouldn't have. Please don't take what I said seriously, Honorary Senior Researcher. I'm begging you! Please don't rat me on me to Choiseul or Raimondo.
 When are you planning on returning to the Institute?
Hautemontagne: Returning? Well... When the repairs are done, of course. The Three-Phase Asynchronous Elemental Tuner is not something that can be fixed in a day.
Hautemontagne: I also have to design a comprehensive maintenance plan for the folks here. It requires taking the environment, the people, changes in the geography, and available materials into consideration.
Hautemontagne: See, all this takes time, so I won't be able to go back for quite a while.
 Goodbye.
Hautemontagne: Wait! Wait! I'm begging you, Honorary Senior Researcher. Please don't rat me out back at the institute! Please!

Dialogue Set #2[]

(If Hautemontagne and Little Mao are in Yilong Wharf)
Little Mao: Listening to Mountain, it sounds like Fontaine's operas are pretty similar to ours!
Little Mao: Knights, magicians, brave warriors, and evil dragons, you kill me, I kill you, and in the end, everyone winds up dead!
Hautemontagne: What's important isn't the ending! It's the process — how you get there! Not every tragedy can be seen as a mere sequence of fight scenes!
Little Mao: Oh, oh! And the "Ray-more-young Golems" Mountain was just talking about sound really, really cool too! I wonder if they're bigger than Bluey?
Hautemontagne: Eh? Bluey?
Little Mao: Oh, right! I never told you about Bluey, did I... How about this? You tell me more about "Ray-more-young Golems," and I'll tell you about Bluey!
