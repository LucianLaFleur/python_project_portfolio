Dialogue[]

(Before unlocking Just Wushou Dance!)
Xiaqing: Just bit more prep, and this event will be even doper!
(TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler): (This person seems to be busy preparing an event, and doesn't have much time for idle banter...)
(After completing Just Wushou Dance!)
Xiaqing: (‍DudeDudeText for male Traveler/DudetteDudetteText for female Traveler‍) of legendary deeds, you're positively glowing. Looks like you're rarin' to go! Ready for a round of "Just Wushou Dance!"?
 Yes, I will have this dance.
Xiaqing: Rock on, have fun!
(Opens the Joyful Beasts and Their Auspices interface)
 About the props and venue for "Just Wushou Dance!"...
Xiaqing: Not bad, eh? All the mods were made by yours truly!
Xiaqing: I added several kinds of special talcum powder to the dance suit, and it all gets mixed together when you pull the rope! The mixture releases a bunch of gas, which helps the outfit suddenly stiffen, solid as a rock and proud as a lion!
Xiaqing: So no matter how much you jump and dance, or bump and prance, you won't get hurt none! Fun and safety, all in one!
Xiaqing: The technique's been used on ships for a long time now, y'know. Sailors use it to protect cargo! No matter how the waves toss around the boxes, the stuff inside won't get smashed to smithereens.
Xiaqing: Anyway, as for the venue, I rented it from the shop! A big ol' empty basement like that, just sitting there unused and wasted. Well, it's sure being put to good use now!
Xiaqing: The boss of this shop is pretty dope, too! Me promoting the Wushou Dance game helps bring in big business, so he didn't ask for much rent!
Xiaqing: Depending on how things go, maybe I'll even be able to get Gaming over to put on a real show here!
 Happy Lantern Rite! Don't forget to rest!
Xiaqing: No prob! Play hard, eat harder!
