Dialogue[]

Yunyun: Moo!
 Rub-rubs!
Yunyun: (Yunyun sticks out its tongue without comprehension, but lets you rub its cheek anyway.)
 Pinches!
Yunyun: (Yunyun tilts its head doubtfully, but goes along with you anyway...)
 See you later, Yunyun!
Yunyun: (Yunyun lazily swings and stomps its feet. You suppose this can be considered a farewell.)
