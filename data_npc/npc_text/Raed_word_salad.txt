Profile[]
Raed is a researcher from the Vahumana Darshan of the Sumeru Akademiya. He is the leader of an archaeological expedition to collect relics in the Great Red Sand, with Bakr and Bandak as bodyguards. However, they have secretly been selling off the relics they find on the black market, with their most recent "product" being a construct they call the Ruin Wanderer, which they seek to replace with broken machinery in order to hide their illicit deal. However, this is interrupted by Faruzan and the Traveler, who come in search of a Restitution Module for Karkata and end up exposing Raed's misdeeds. Raed and his guards are soon frightened away when the Ruin Wanderer (actually a mechanical companion of Faruzan from the past) suddenly reactivates.[2]

Appearance[]
Raed has blonde, slicked-back hair. He wears the blue-and-green robes of an Akademiya scholar.
