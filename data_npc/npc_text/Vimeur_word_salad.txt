Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Before completing Masquerade of the Guilty.


Vimeur: Hello there. Is anything the matter? I can help you with it — so long as it doesn't involve performances.
 Is there something wrong with performances?
Vimeur: Not that, per se. I'm just not all that interested in operas, plays, or magic, and the like.
Vimeur: Speaking of which, I was only sent here because when asked "do you like theater?" I answered "no."
Vimeur: I suppose they don't want Gardes posted here to be distracted by performances or trials. We do need to focus on work, after all.
 A trial that looks like a performance?
Vimeur: It's just a metaphor. Since the Hydro Archon would be present, we usually add some dramatic elements, like those found in plays.
Vimeur: But the trials themselves are legitimate. Thanks to the Chief Justice and Oratrice's just verdict, every trial will come to a successful conclusion.

 I'm fine at the moment, thanks.
Vimeur: Alright then, see you.

Dialogue Set #2[]
After completing Masquerade of the Guilty.


Vimeur: Hello there. Is anything the matter? I can help you with it — so long as it doesn't involve performances.

Vimeur: I suppose they don't want Gardes posted here to be distracted by performances or trials. We do need to focus on work, after all.
Vimeur: They've made big changes in how they publicize the performances and trials as if they're trying to differentiate more between them. That's a good thing, for me at least.
 I see...
Vimeur: Um, it seems that Lady Furina has left the Palais Mermonia and no longer involves herself in trials.
Vimeur: Oops, I guess it's easy to slip into old habits when addressing her... Well, not that it matters. Whatever the case may be, she has dedicated herself to serving Fontaine for hundreds of years.
Vimeur: And even if she's not present, the trial will proceed without issues. You should have faith in the impartial judgments of our judges.

 I'm fine at the moment, thanks.
Vimeur: Alright then, see you.
