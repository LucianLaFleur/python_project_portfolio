Qiuyue: Dear guest, would you like to purchase some minerals from Liyue?
 Let's see what you've got...
(After completing Chisato's Letter)
Qiuyue: Come on in then, and take a look. These are all the finest!

 Adventure Challenge
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Qiuyue: How about that? I'm unbeatable at Genius Invokation TCG!
(If the player wins the match)

Qiuyue: ...How could I let you get away with that... I need to think about it...
 Do you have any information about Inazuman ores? (Unknown trigger condition)
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Qiuyue knows; Version 1)

Qiuyue: Hmm, come to think of it, I've heard that some people saw some ore resembling purplish crystals nearby.
Qiuyue: That said, I'm just a businessperson, and I'm not in the mining business either. And it's not like I can leave my store so easily, anyway...
Qiuyue: I'd say that they saw it around... here. There, it should be marked on your map now. If you think it'll be of any use to you, feel free to take a look.
(Rich Ore Reserves marked on the map)
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Qiuyue knows; Version 2)

Qiuyue: Hmm, now that you mention it, I've heard that someone found some ores nearby that are of better quality than usual.
Qiuyue: That said, I'm just a businessperson, and I'm not in the mining business either. And it's not like I can leave my store so easily, anyway...
Qiuyue: I'd say that they saw it around... here. There, it should be marked on your map now. If you think it'll be of any use to you, feel free to take a look.
(Rich Ore Reserves marked on the map)
(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Qiuyue knows)

Qiuyue: Well... I'd say that things are the same as always. The flow of goods from Liyue is as bottle-necked as ever. No special change on that front.
 Is there anything of note nearby? (Unknown trigger condition)
(Same as before, Ore Vein condition)
 Is there anything of note nearby? (Unknown trigger condition)
Qiuyue: Hmm. It does seem like more and more people have decided to come to Ritou to set up shop.
Qiuyue: There'll be more competition, but more customers as well, so I suppose it's a net gain.
 About this shop...
Qiuyue: This shop is the Inazuma franchise of the Chuyu Trading Company. We mainly sell minerals, jewelry, and jade artifacts.
Qiuyue: We offer the finest materials from Liyue. Each piece is a gift from Rex Lapis.
Qiuyue: Although we don't boast the same reputation as those classic brands like The Jade Mystery or Mingxing Jewelry, the quality of our products is definitely on par with theirs!
 How's business been?
(Before completing Transient Dreams)

Qiuyue: We're doing okay. After all, there is always demand for minerals no matter where you go.
Qiuyue: ...If there is demand, there is a market, and Liyue merchants will never miss a business opportunity!
Qiuyue: The only problem here is the Sakoku Decree. Our import channels were still affected by it in the end... Ah, it's such a headache.
(After completing Transient Dreams)

Qiuyue: It's been great, recently. I mean, ore is always in demand, you know? And where there's demand, there's a market, and we Liyue merchants will never miss a business opportunity!
Qiuyue: The other thing is the opening of the trade roads, which has resulted in increased channels and buyers alike.
Qiuyue: Once I scrounge up some more capital, I'm opening up a branch in Inazuma City!
Qiuyue: Gotta take advantage of the situation before someone sets themselves up as my competitor here, you know?
 About Rex Lapis...
Qiuyue: Do you mean the passing of Rex Lapis? I've already heard about that.
Qiuyue: When that incident took place, the lockdown of Inazuma had already happened, so I also missed the Rite of Parting.
Qiuyue: *sigh* I'm still broken up about it. I'm sure every Liyue citizen would've grieved too.
 I've seen the Rite of Parting...
Qiuyue: Wow! So you are the rumored foreign Traveler that assisted with the Rite of Parting!
Qiuyue: I apologize for my rudeness. As one of Rex Lapis' subjects, I need to properly show you my gratitude.
Qiuyue: Please accept my humble gift. Make sure you take it.
(Obtain  Prithiva Topaz Fragment ×1)
 Goodbye.
Qiuyue: Take care! Come back anytime!

Event Dialogue[]
Hues of the Violet Garden[]

(After completing Festive Elegance)
Qiuyue: People have been asking me lately if I know where to find Mr. Zhenyu from Liyue, but I've never heard of this person in my life.
Qiuyue: Is he some kind of superstar, even more well-known than the Qixing somehow?
Qiuyue: Ah, sorry for the wait, dear customer. Would you like some ores from Liyue?
