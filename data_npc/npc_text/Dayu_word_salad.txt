Profile[]
Dayu is a young but capable carpenter that becomes officially apprenticed to Master Lu of Fanmu Carpenter. While eager to earn that apprenticeship by doing jobs on Master Lu's behalf, he had also taken available jobs under other carpenters, and worked for the carpenter that built the temporary stage at the reconstructed Jade Chamber for Yun Jin's premiere performance of The Divine Damsel of Devastation. This experience worked well in his stead when Master Lu gives him his first official job, namely rebuilding the stage of Heyu Tea House.
