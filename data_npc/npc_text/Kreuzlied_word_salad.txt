Kreuzlied was an alias[Note 1] ascribed to a member of the Wanderer's Troupe who wielded The Bell.
Originally born to the Lawrence Clan, he turned his back on the clan and was disowned in turn. At some point either before or after he was disowned, he became the last known member to join the Wanderer's Troupe.[1]
After the Troupe's failed uprising against the aristocracy, Kreuzlied was spared from severe punishment thanks to his privileged origins, despite being disowned. The deaths of his companions did not deter him, however, from establishing an underground organization dedicated to undermining the aristocracy and later aiding Vennessa's rebellion.[2] Both his true name and his ultimate fate are left unknown.

↑ It is not clear in the English version, but the Chinese description for Goblet of the Sojourner makes it clear that Kreuzlied was an alias, not his real name.
