Iron Ingot is an open-world NPC in Liyue. He is a miner, but due to the mine at the Chasm being sealed off, he has some free time. He can be found at nighttime in Dunyu Ruins, near to the Statue of The Seven statue, "studying" astronomy with Ziwei.
Following a certain dialogue branch for the first time gives the player five Enhancement Ores.

Dialogue[]

Iron Ingot: Hello, how are you?
 What are you doing?
(Before completing Condition missing)

Iron Ingot: Actually, the mine at the Chasm has been sealed off. I have nothing to do at the moment.
Iron Ingot: So I came here to study some astronomy from this nice lady. Learn something new, you know.
Iron Ingot: Take a look... Doesn't it look amazing from this angle...
(After completing Condition missing)

Iron Ingot: Actually, the mine at the Chasm hasn't been fully reopened yet, so I have nothing to do at the moment.
Iron Ingot: So I came here to study some astronomy from this nice lady. Learn something new, you know.
Iron Ingot: Take a look... Doesn't it look amazing from this angle...
 You like star gazing too?
Iron Ingot: I sure do! Just because I'm a miner with not much education doesn't mean I'm any less curious about the night sky than you!
Iron Ingot: Look at this one... So exquisitely composed, so graceful and lovely... Awesome.
 Are you talking about the constellations?
Iron Ingot: Nah, who's looking at the constellations...
Iron Ingot: ...I mean, yes! That's right, the constellations!
Iron Ingot: Look at that constellation, Mysterious Adeptus of the Highest Heaven Soaring Across the Skies. Don't you think it looks like... Y'know?
 You're not talking about the constellations, are you?
Iron Ingot: Hey, cut that out! Can't you see I'm watching the... uh, stars, very intently!?
Iron Ingot: Or would you like to follow... I mean, would you like to learn about astronomy from this lady?
Iron Ingot: Shoo, shoo! First come, first served, don't you get it? Now take these ores and scram, and stop disturbing our star-gazing!
(Obtain  Enhancement Ore ×5)
 ...Bye.
Iron Ingot: Goodbye, take care now!
Iron Ingot: It's so beautiful...
