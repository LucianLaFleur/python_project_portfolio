Dialogue[]

Nawaz: Scarabs~ Oh, Scarabs~ Where are you~?
 Scarabs?
Nawaz: Huh, you don't know what Scarabs are? They're the most awesome bugs ever!
Nawaz: They have the coolest shells, the coolest patterns, and they shine the coolest gold under the sun!
Nawaz: I've heard the adults say that Scarabs contain something truly amazing, put inside them by King Deshret himself so that they can protect us.
Nawaz: I mean, doesn't that just sound like the best thing ever?
 Could you tell me more about King Deshret?
Nawaz: Well, I don't actually know that much myself. Some adults say that we should believe in the Dendro Archon, and others say that we should believe in King Deshret...
Nawaz: Do those gods just not get along or something?
Nawaz: King Deshret has the coolest Scarabs, but those adults who tell me to believe in King Deshret always sound so annoying... I don't like them.
Nawaz: I've heard that King Deshret once had loads of awesome animal friends! Sheep, wolves, and... and... what was that again...?
Nawaz: Well, whatever the case, how could he be an unfriendly god if he was such good friends with the animals?
Nawaz: But if that was true, why are the people who believe in him so unfriendly?
 Make sure to be friendly to others.
Nawaz: Yeah, that's what I think, too!
Nawaz: A friendly person has gotta have the coolest bug!
Nawaz: Speaking of which, you don't have any Scarabs yet, do you? C'mon, I'll give you a few — and may they protect you and those around you!
(Obtain  Scarab ×4)
 Where are they?
Nawaz: Where are they~?♪
