Profile[]
Hongdou, nicknamed Doudou by her mother, Chenxiang, is a chronically ill girl who lives in Liyue Harbor. Apparently Hongdou's condition is chronic and incurable, but medicine from Bubu Pharmacy is able to keep the symptoms at bay. During the commission Good Medicine Tastes Bitter, the Traveler can bring Chenxiang some Almond Tofu to bribe Hongdou to take the bitter medicine.

Dialogue[]

Chenxiang: Doudou, be a good girl, let's go pick your medicine. You'll only get better if you take your medicine.
Hongdou: I'm not going, I'm not going! I hate the medicine at Bubu Pharmacy. I hate it!
Chenxiang: You need to do as you're told, Doudou... And hey, if we go to Bubu Pharmacy, you'll get to see Baizhu. How about that?
Hongdou: Wow, really? ...Mr. Baizhu is so nice, I'm sure just seeing him will make me better. Then I won't need any medicine!
Chenxiang: Hmm, but if poor Mr. Baizhu found out you didn't like his medicine... You wouldn't want to make him mad, would you?
Hongdou: Erm... erm... What about if we just pick the medicine, but I don't take it?
