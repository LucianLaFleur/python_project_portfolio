Dialogue[]

Remande: Once we're done preparing the film, we can continue taking boat-tos!
 Is there anything of note nearby?
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Remande knows)

Remande: Er... Does "the aquabus repairman might've been put in a bad mood by my many questions" count?
Remande: I'm kidding! The repairman was great. He told me that there's a place nearby that produces Condessence Crystals and Magical Crystal Ore, which I can use to make models.
Remande: That said, I don't think I'd be any good at excavation by hand — might be better to just buy the ore pre-processed. But if you have need of them, you can check the place out.
(Rich Ore Reserves marked on the map)
(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Remande knows)

Remande: Not that I remember... Certainly not anything worth taking pictures of.
 Boat-tos?
Remande: Boat-tos! Photos of boats. Boats, photos — by which I mean pictures of the aquabuses.
Remande: I absolutely adore the aquabus network — really, I'd take a picture of every last detail if I could.
Remande: My dream is to someday recreate a scale clockwork model of an aquabus without needing to refer to the real object, or even pictures of it.
Remande: At this moment, I've reached the phase where I'm taking photos daily, and familiarizing myself with them. Wish me well, friend!
 Sounds impressive.
Remande: Of course it does! If you are interested as well, you are welcome to join us aquabus enthusiasts.
Remande: However, I have a few reminders for newcomers.
Remande: While admiring the aquabuses, do not behave in any way that might interfere with the normal functioning of aquabus facilities or disturb the tour guides on the aquabuses.
(Obtain  Teachings of Order ×3)
 See you.
Remande: See you — be sure to take a trip onboard yourself!
