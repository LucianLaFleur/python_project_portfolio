Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Raef: Not here yet, huh...
 What are you waiting for?
Raef: To tell you the truth, I'm not sure either.
Raef: It might be those who left the village to buy some daily essentials, and it might also be the goods that our Eremite friends are sending over.
Raef: Who knows? We might even receive guests from Shamaniyya.
Raef: Alright, alright. In truth, my role is that of a lookout. I warn people of hazards that arise from the desert.
Raef: That said, though, the desert around Aaru Village is a place of relative quiet, so what I usually end up reporting is the arrival of goods from outside the village.
Raef: But thanks to that, I also get to hang out and chat with those who often travel outside, you know, maybe ask them to get me some seeds or a pot of flowers.
 Fond of planting flowers?
Raef: Well, uh, I... I just like having some to send to my girlfriend, you get what I mean?
Raef: She's never been the healthy sort, so she's always at home resting and can't come out often... But she always looks way better when she has some plants for company.
Raef: I mean, Aaru Village is as you see it... It's no haven for plants that need water.
Raef: Many times, those flowers that do get sent over don't live long even when given a lot of loving care.
Raef: That's why I ask my fellow workers to get some of that stuff whenever I get the chance.
 Sha-what-yya?
Raef: Oh? Are you interested?
Raef: According to legend, they are a group of people who dwell in the depths of the desert.
Raef: Some say that they were not on good terms with the Akademiya, and thus fled deep into the desert to avoid them.
Raef: Others say that they are an investigation team sent into the desert by the Akademiya.
Raef: As for the details, I'm not very sure, but it's all hearsay. No one has ever seen them.
Raef: But between you and me, I do hope that this legend is in fact real. It would be nice to see them and hear their tales from far away someday, you know?
 See you around.
Raef: See you. Be wary of any changes in the environment when you are out in the desert!

Nighttime[]

Raef: Dear, why did you sneak outside again?
Nermin: Oh, uh, don't worry! The night's not quite as hot, so it's perfect for getting some fresh air outside.
Raef: The night is much cooler than the day, which makes it all the more reason to take better care of your health. Besides, you should stay where there's more greenery...
Nermin: Yes, I know, I know. I just need to get out sometimes, you know? Just sometimes.
Nermin: Look at you! You're so young, but already sound like my folks.
Raef: Wh—What? ...I mean, anyone who cares about you would say that! ...Ahem, anyway. How's the pot of flowers I gave you?
Nermin: Um, yes, thanks for sending me the flowers. They are very beautiful. But the leaves are starting to turn yellow...
Nermin: Sorry for not taking good care of them...
Raef: N—No, don't apologize! It's fine, it's not your fault!
