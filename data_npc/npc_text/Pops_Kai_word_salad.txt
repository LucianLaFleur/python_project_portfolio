Dialogue[]

Pops Kai: Here for some tea? Please take a seat!
 What do you have to sell, sir?
Pops Kai: Please have a seat and stay for a while. You can try some of our very own Qingce Village tea.

 Tell me about your tea store.
Pops Kai: I set up shop here to provide some respite from the grueling and relentless farm work, both for old friends and for anyone else passing by.
Pops Kai: But as you can see, business could be a little better, hehehe.
Pops Kai: Still. Every time someone comes to me for a cup of tea and a chat, I think to myself, this is worth my while.
 Do you run the place on your own?
Pops Kai: That's right. My son and his wife are off elsewhere, chasing their dreams. It's just the grandkids and I who are left in the village.
Pops Kai: *sigh* If only I had an assistant. I could keep the place open while I was working in the fields.
 Goodbye.
Pops Kai: Leaving so soon? Have a safe trip.

Unreconciled Stars[]

Pops Kai: Would you like some tea? Come sit, sit. These meteorites have really gotten everyone worked up. The number of people who come here to chat have grown fewer in number.
