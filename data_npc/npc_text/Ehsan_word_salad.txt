Dialogue[]

Ehsan: Hello, are you a guest invited by the Lord? Do you need help with your luggage?
 About the Lord...
Ehsan: Oh, you're here to pay the Lord a visit? Then please inquire about it with the butler.
Ehsan: I'm just hired by the butler to carry goods. To be honest, I haven't even met the Lord myself, so I really can't help. Sorry.
 Not at the moment.
Ehsan: Alright, let me know if you need me.
