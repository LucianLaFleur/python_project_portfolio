Media:VO Tuman All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Tuman: (Looks like reselling mushrooms isn't so easy, either...)

Dialogue[]

Tuman: Chin up! For Rukkhadivine Mushrooms...
 Rukkha... divine?
Tuman: Ahem, yes, those huge mushrooms on the trees. Everyone's seen them.
Tuman: Huh? They're called Rukkhashava Mushrooms?
Tuman: Fine, if you say so. It doesn't make a difference to me, it's still some divine thingy I can sell.
 Sell?
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

Tuman: Yeah, don't you know? These huge mushrooms that grow in the rainforest can be sold for quite a bit in the city.
Tuman: Seems like the Akademiya's always in need of a huge amount of these great mushrooms, so they probably wouldn't mind a nobody like me making a little money, right?
Tuman: Anyway, my plan to resell — I mean, my plan to sell these mushrooms is perfect, but there's just one problem, The Withering.
Tuman: *sigh* How strong must my desire to sell mushrooms be in order to get a Vision?
Tuman: Dealing with The Withering will be a piece of cake once I have a Vision.
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

Tuman: Yeah, don't you know? These huge mushrooms that grow in the rainforest can be sold for quite a good sum in the city.
Tuman: Seems like the Akademiya's always in need of a huge amount of these great mushrooms, so they probably wouldn't mind if a nobody made a little sum off 'em, right?
Tuman: Anyway, my plan to resell— I mean, my plan to sell these mushrooms is perfect! There's just one problem, though. The Withering.
Tuman: Wait, what? The Withering isn't cropping up everywhere anymore? But I've heard that it's still out there in the forest... you aren't trying to trick me, are you?
Tuman: *sigh* Do you know how strong my desire to sell mushrooms must be in order to land a Vision?
Tuman: The Withering would be a piece of cake if I had one of those.
 Bye.
Tuman: Good luck! Oh, I meant for myself...
