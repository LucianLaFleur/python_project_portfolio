Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Marvin: Ahhh! Father, please...
Marvin: ...Oh. You gave me a real fright... Who are you? *yawn*
 About Stormterror...
(After completing A Long Shot)
Marvin: I dare not even think of it. When the storm came, a huge rock came hurtling towards me. Fortunately, it missed, smashing into the ground next to me.
Marvin: At that instant, all I could think about was my girlfriend. That was when I realized she means the world to me.
Marvin: Even if my father opposes us being together and tries to meddle into our affairs, our relationship will survive!
Marvin: Yes. We will be together. I just... need some time to persuade my father...
 Are you... sleeping with your eyes open?
Marvin: I was... until you woke me up!
Marvin: This is an act, you know. Something to fool my family, so that this night's rendezvous will not be exposed... Ahem.
Marvin: It's very impolite to wake someone when they're sleeping, so please refrain from doing it again. You won't find me to be as agreeable as my father... *yawn*
 Who's your father?
Marvin: My family name is Goth, get the picture?
Marvin: My father is the general manager of the Goth Grand Hotel.
Marvin: Don't be fooled by his Mr. Nice Guy act — he's being completely obstinate and unreasonable on the matter of my marriage!
Marvin: That's why all I can do in the middle of the night is to... to— Wait a moment, you haven't been sent by him to get me talking, have you?
Marvin: Go away, get out of here. I am wide awake, I'm not in the slightest bit sleepy... *yawn*
 Goodbye.
Marvin: *yawn* What were... you... say— *snoring*

Nighttime[]

Marvin: You came to me again, my darling Marla!
Marla: Oh, Marvin; how could I ever let you go! I don't care what your father thinks about our being together, my love for you is like... like the ice at the river's source in Springvale...
Marvin: Marla, no... Your love should not be a thing so cold...
Marla: I mean not that; I mean that my love will become a sweet spring of live-giving water with which to quench your thirst for a thousand — nay, for ten thousand years...
Marvin: Oh, Marla, my love! Then my love for you is like the eyes of the eagle who soars over Falcon Coast...
Marla: Marvin, no... Your love should not be a thing so shrewd...
Marvin: I mean not that; I mean that I could not bear for you to disappear from my gaze, even for a moment; and if ever there came one who sought to steal you away from me, I would surely make known unto them the sharpness of my talons and the hardness of my beak...
Marla: Oh, Marvin!
Marvin: Oh, Marla!

Event Dialogue[]
Invitation of Windblume[]
Daytime[]

Marvin: Ugh, should I tell my father or not?
Marvin: No, I suppose it would be best if I didn't. But if I don't tell him, I...
 Something on your mind?
Marvin: I... I have a friend. Yes, a friend...
Marvin: He's very taken with a certain girl, but unfortunately, she doesn't come from a particularly wealthy family, so my friend's rather worried that his father will oppose their marriage.
Marvin: Thing is, he truly loves that girl and wants her to be his wife.
Marvin: So I... well, he, is wondering if he should simply come clean with his father...
 You sure you're talking about a friend?
Marvin: Ahem! *cough* D-Don't you dare say such scurrilous things...
Marvin: Wait a moment, you haven't been sent by the old man to test me, have you?
Marvin: Hmph, whatever. I said nothing. Just go.
 I don't think you should...
Marvin: Hmm, is that so...
Marvin: *cough* Ah, uh. I said nothing. You don't hear anything from me!
 I'll leave you to it, then.
Marvin: Yes, alright. Please don't disturb me any further...

Nighttime[]

Marvin: Marla, the Windblume Festival is here, and yet, it holds no meaning for me...
Marla: Oh, Marvin, say not that!
Marla: We do not have your father's approval, but this time for lovers is ours also...
Marvin: No, what I mean is that as long as I am with you, every day may as well be the Windblume Festival.
Marla: You're right, Marvin. Our love is like the dandelions that bloom on Cape Oath...
Marvin: Marla, no... Our love should not be a thing so fragile...
Marla: No, I mean to say that though the dandelions are scattered by the wild winds, their lives will not thusly end.
Marla: Dandelion Seeds will fly to distant places, take root, and sprout there... One day, they will cover the length and breadth of Teyvat.
Marvin: Oh, my darling Marla...
Marla: Oh, Marvin! My love...

Of Ballads and Brews[]

(Nighttime; After Aroma of the Past)‍[verification needed]
Marla: There you are, dear Marvin.
Marvin: Oh, Marla! I can't turn my back on you, not when you're inviting me to Weinlesefest!
Marla: No matter what your father thinks of us, my love... is like wine made from Mist Flowers...
Marvin: Marla, no... Your love should not be a thing so cold...
Marla: No. I mean that, my love will turn into burning liquor to warm you for a thousand —& nay, for ten thousand years...
Marvin: Oh, Marla, my love! Then my love for you is like the bitter north wind that follows the west wind...
Marla: Marvin, no... Your love should not be a thing so chilly...
Marvin: No. I mean that, I don't want you out of my sight, not even for a moment. I want to turn into a full season of Mondstadt's wind, always by your side...
Marla: Oh, Marvin!
Marvin: Oh, Marla!

Windblume's Breath[]

(Nighttime)
Marvin: Marla, the Windblume Festival is here, and yet, it holds no meaning for me...
Marla: Oh, Marvin, say not that!
Marla: We do not have your father's approval, but this time for lovers is ours also...
Marvin: No, what I mean is that as long as I am with you, every day may well as be the Windblume Festival.
Marla: You're right, Marvin. Our love is like the dandelions that bloom on Cape Oath...
Marvin: Marla, no... Our love should not be a thing so fragile...
Marla: No, I mean to say that though the dandelions are scattered by the wild winds, their lives will not thusly end.
Marla: Dandelion Seeds will fly to distant places, take root, and sprout there... One day, they will cover the length and breadth of Teyvat.
