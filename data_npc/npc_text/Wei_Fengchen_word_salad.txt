Idle Quotes[]

 This is your destiny...
Media:VO Wei Fengchen 01.ogg "When you stand for justice, this is your destiny..."

Dialogue[]

Wei Fengchen: The good, the bad, the ugly... You name it. I've seen it all.
Wei Fengchen: You... got a score you need me to settle?
 How can you tell?
Wei Fengchen: The web of gratitude and grievances... it ensnares us all. When it comes to debt, you're either owed one, or have one to pay.
Wei Fengchen: As a martial nomad, I've been fighting against the injustice in this world for over ten years now. Sure, you can get vengeance for some, but in most cases, the vicious cycle goes on and on... In the end, you get caught up in it yourself..
Wei Fengchen: Maybe that's just destiny for people who choose this path. I've come to accept it. There's just... one tiny issue...
 Which is...
Wei Fengchen: Just that... Um, I haven't eaten in days. Could you get me something to eat?
Wei Fengchen: If it's alright, I'd like some Mora Meat, Squirrel Fish, Fullmoon Egg, Matsutake and Cured Pork Dry Hotpot, Jueyun Chili Chicken, Jewelry Soup...
Wei Fengchen: ...Ah, which one do I choose? I need to think about this...
 About martial nomads...
Wei Fengchen: The way the world is now, martial nomads who perform heroic deeds have grown few and far between, and those who seek justice like myself are fewer still.
Wei Fengchen: Do not believe those stories written by that village bumpkin in the mountains. Those are not real heroes...
Wei Fengchen: I have written my experiences down here. Have a look — they should be enough to clear my name.
(Obtain  Wanderer's Advice ×7)
 No.
Wei Fengchen: That is a good thing. If there were no injustice in this world, I could quietly return to a more normal life...

Trivia[]
The "village bumpkin" he talks about is probably Chang the Ninth, an aspiring author who is currently penning the story First Apprentice of Guhua.
