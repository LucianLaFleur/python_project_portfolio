Profile[]
Futsu Minori was a talented swordsmith of the Futsu School and forged Hasui Geppaku Futsu, a blade worthy enough to be wielded by the Raiden Shogun's valet. She had a son, Futsu Hiroyoshi, and also took in a mute orphan who would take on the name Futsu Masayoshi. Hasui Geppaku Futsu was eventually destroyed in a certain battle to "decide the fate of the oni people." It was sent to the Futsu School to be reforged, but because Minori was no longer in physical condition to forge blades, Masayoshi took the up the task and forged Haran Geppaku Futsu.[1]

Story[]
Little is known about Futsu Minori's past, but she told Masayoshi about her mother and brother's wishes. She was afflicted by an old wound on her side and owned a crimson hakama that she could never wear. Likely as a result of past woes, Minori was also something of an alcoholic, which contributed her physical decline in the later stages of her life.[1]
Minori had a reputation for capriciousness and arrogance, but Masayoshi was close with her because she had taken him in when nobody else had and gave him his nickname, Masagomaru. She, in turn, confided in him and told him many things about herself that she normally did not divulge, joking that his muteness meant he would not spill her secrets. Masayoshi's talent for bladesmithing led Minori to recommend him as fourth-generation head of the Futsu School multiple times, but he declined every time. After her death, Masayoshi taught Hiroyoshi her techniques and departed from the school after seeing that Hiroyoshi could lead the school on his own.[1]
