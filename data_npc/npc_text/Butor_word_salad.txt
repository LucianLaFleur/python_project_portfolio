Monsieur Butor was one of Fontaine's leading researchers of traditional clockwork machinery. He was the director of the Institute of Clockwork Applications, a program within the Fontaine Research Institute. However, this field of research was slowly growing obsolete, and traditional clockwork technology was becoming less practical. Nacker states that funding for Butor's program was cut, and he struggled to recruit new researchers for his team.[1] 
Butor had at least three subordinates: Clynes, Teilhard, and one other person who was fired from the Institute, possibly Coutrot.[2]
Butor was the inventor of the Cipher Letters, though he never found a practical use for the technology, and the Institute's executives also ignored it.[3] Teilhard and Clynes ended up using them to leave messages around the Institute against Butor's wishes.[4] He also developed a chemical solvent which would erase the Cipher Letters, but all traces of the formula were erased by Teilhard.[5][6]
Butor ultimately died of an illness.[2][3] Clynes and Teilhard tried to carry on his field of research through projects such as Initial Skill Sample No. 2, but faced setbacks including possible sabotage by Maillardet.[7] Their efforts ended for good after the Arkhium explosion caused by Edwin Eastinghouse: Teilhard died in the explosion, while Clynes lost hope and exiled himself to the Fortress of Meropide.[2][6] Sometime after the explosion, the Fontaine Research Institute planned a memorial service for Butor.[8]
