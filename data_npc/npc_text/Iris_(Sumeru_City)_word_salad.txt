Iris is an open-world NPC located in Sumeru City, Sumeru who comes from a lineage of scholars. She and her younger sister Hawa are both researching material related to King Deshret, while their father is away on an expedition in the desert.
During daytime, she can be found at Puspa Café, sitting across from Nayab. During nighttime, she can be found inside The Akademiya, discussing King Deshret's ancient runes with Hawa.
Following a certain daytime dialogue branch for the first time gives the player one Guide to Ingenuity.

Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Iris: I'll think about my research topic before Nayab finds a new counter card.
 About your research topic...
Iris: I come from a family of academics. Everyone has either worked at the Akademiya or continued their studies there. So, research has become an essential part of my life.
Iris: I'm from Vahumana, and am currently conducting research on the history of the desert and King Deshret.
Iris: One of my younger sisters also happens to be researching the semantics of the ancient King Deshret runes, so occasionally we'll discuss our findings together.
Iris: But she has to instruct new students during the day, so we can only talk at night.
 About that countermeasure card...
Iris: Well, you know the popular card game "Genius Invokation TCG"? It was invented in Sumeru and then spread throughout Teyvat via Inazuma.
Iris: I'd only heard about this game before, but never tried it. Then one day, I came here to have a coffee and Nayab invited me to play a round.
Iris: I was scared out of my wits at first. I thought I'd inadvertently let slip some forbidden knowledge about the King Deshret and that the matra had found me.
Iris: But it was fine in the end. After this matra came over, it was just a few bizarre deck questions from there.
Iris: That isn't the sort of thing I'm good at. I just ask the questions. As for the solutions, I let him work them out for himself.
 It's pretty hard.
Iris: Tell me about it. By the time he comes up with a solution, my sisters and I might have already finished our researchers.
Iris: However, doing research is similar to playing cards. You need to think out of the box to make a breakthrough.
(Obtain  Guide to Ingenuity)
 See you.
Iris: See you later. I'm going to order another cup of coffee and think over the problem.

Nighttime[]

Iris: Are you sure you've found the correct semantic field for these ancient runes?
Hawa: Of course I'm not sure. I'm only speculating.
Hawa: Besides, I discovered that there are overlapping marks on the ancient runes on this stone wall.
Hawa: So, I have reason to suspect that they may have been carved by people over several generations.
Iris: Well, that complicates things... In my history researches, the meanings of runes like these can differ significantly from era to era.
Iris: When will Father finish his desert expedition again? We should ask him what he thinks when he gets back.
Iris: Or ask Rifaet. Maybe he has some leads.
