Profile[]
Sage is fascinated by the fairy tale The Fox in the Dandelion Sea, particularly by the talking foxes mentioned in the story, and dreams of visiting the Dandelion Sea one day so that he can talk to animals. Neither Parsley nor Rosemary believe this Dandelion Sea truly exists or that it is possible to talk to animals, but are split over whether to urge Sage to face reality or allow him to keep his childish fantasies for a little while longer.

Dialogue[]

Sage: Heya!
 Hey there, kiddo.
Sage: Mm! Say, have you heard of the Dandelion Sea?
 The Dandelion Sea, you say?
Sage: Uh-huh! There's this book I read, it says that somewhere in Mondstadt, there is a biiiiig sea of dandelions!
Sage: It even has little talking foxes in it!
 Little talking foxes?
Sage: Yup! I wanna know what talking to animals is like!
Sage: Hmm... But I've only seen a guy in green clothes and white socks talk to animals before. Happened to bump into him.
Sage: I told Mom how awesome he was, but that guy said that I was mistaken.
 See you, kiddo.
Sage: Seeya!
Sage: Tell me if you ever see the Dandelion Sea!

Trivia[]
Parsley, Rosemary, and Sage are all named after herbs. This may be a reference to the lyrics of some versions of the traditional English ballad, Scarborough Fair, in which the line "Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme" form part of the refrain.
