Dialogue[]

Choudy: I can drink more! Boss... I mean, Captain! Chief Mate! Second Mate! Where's the booze?
 Are you alright?
Choudy: Who are you? "Bournonville" is no good... I want "Vedrenn." Where...
Choudy: I got it! You're "Augier"! Hahaha! Come on, give me a sip.
 Y—You just stay away from me! Stop acting so weird!
Choudy: ...Huh? Who are you? Not drinking with me? Fine by me, I'll drink alone... *hic*...
Choudy: Why isn't my wine here yet...
 What are you doing?
Choudy: Can't you see I'm drinking? I'd rather you not join, at least not for now.
 Bye.
Choudy: *hic*... Wine... not here yet...
