Dialogue[]

Vile: Still she refuses to admit it, despite being confronted with all the evidence...
Vile: Oh, it's you traveler.
 What were you muttering to yourself about?
Vile: Sara decided she wanted to import Liyue chili peppers recently. Allegedly, they're hot enough to reduce even Mondstadt's die-hard spice lover Barbara to tears.
Vile: My view is they'd be nigh on impossible to sell, seeing as eighty-six percent of Mondstadters won't touch them.
 ...Barbara is a die-hard spice lover?
Vile: Oh, you hadn't heard? It was my understanding that everyone in Mondstadt knew.
 Tell me some more things that everyone in Mondstadt knows.
(Version 1)

Vile: Things like when Outrider Amber volunteered to cook at the last Knights of Favonius get-together, burnt the steak, and smoked out the whole kitchen?
Vile: Even though Amber made everyone there promise to never tell a soul...
Vile: ...I think you might be the last person in Mondstadt to hear about it.
(Version 2)

Vile: Sure. Besides for just political purposes, they say that merchants were also among the diplomatic mission that came to Mondstadt from Snezhnaya. They came bearing "Fire-Water," a kind of specialty alcohol from Snezhnaya, with aims of starting a partnership with Dawn Winery.
Vile: During the banquet that was held at Dawn Winery, Master Diluc raised his glass filled with the exotic Snezhnaya Fire-Water and asked a maid to fill the glasses of the Snezhnaya merchants with Dawn Winery's own finest Dandelion Wine.
Vile: To show his respect, Master Diluc followed the Snezhnayan custom and downed the entire glass of Fire-Water.
Vile: The Snezhnayan guests then fervently applauded his heroism, and he nodded politely in response, but it wasn't long before he felt as if the world was spinning around him.
Vile: He managed to maintain his calm demeanor as owner of the winery to the end of the banquet. But once the festivities were over, Master Diluc passed out in his quarters for the next three days.
Vile: Everyone in Dawn Winery was worried if Master Diluc had actually fallen victim to some Snezhnayan plot.
Vile: Adelinde, who regularly tends to Master Diluc's daily needs, reassured everyone saying, "Master is fine. Although, I've never seen someone get drunk like that before..."
Vile: Once Master Diluc regained consciousness, this first thing he did was refuse the partnership with the Snezhnayan merchant — "The people of Mondstadt can't handle this."
(Version 3)

Vile: Certainly, I'm sure everyone knows about Librarian Lisa's habit of drinking afternoon tea.
Vile: Well, one day, a traveling merchant from Liyue saw Lisa using some special web-shaped things to filter her tea.
Vile: Although the merchant never saw exactly what it was that Lisa was using, nevertheless a new drink known as Earl Stocking Tea was later released imitating Lisa's own technique.
Vile: Shortly after the matter, some people claimed that what Lisa was using for her tea was just an ordinary filtration material, used all the time in alchemy. But even I'm not entirely sure what the truth of the matter is...
Vile: Over time, that ambiguously named tea drink started to gain popularity, even in Mondstadt, a city that's known for its wine culture more than anything else.
Vile: I can't help but admire the entrepreneurial minds of the people of Liyue. They're always coming up with something bound to catch on with people... Hmm...
 You should tell her about your concerns.
Vile: Oh believe me, I've tried.
Vile: If I can't think of anything better, I may have to send in Prince Charming...
Vile: Kaeya's got a certain way with words; he would only need to drop a few subtle hints and the whole thing would be sorted.
Vile: Ahem. Anyway. Thanks for the chat.
 Seen anyone who looks a lot like me?
Vile: Oh, so you're looking for family.
Vile: While I know most anything about Mondstadt, I have to admit that this is one thing I'm not apprised of...
Vile: There's just been no time — too much on my plate, lately.
Vile: When I'm done settling those things, I'll help you look.
 Goodbye.
Vile: See you soon.
Vile: If you hear any funny stories on your travels, do share!

Hidden Strife[]

(Talk to Vile seated beside Angel's Share)
Media:vo hyeq002 9 vile 01.ogg Vile: Huh? Why are you visiting me at this hour... not trying to buy intel from me, are you?
Media:vo hyeq002 9 vile 02.ogg Vile: I've been very busy lately, you know. A major client has booked two full weeks of my time.
 A major client, you say?
Media:vo hyeq002 9 vile 03a.ogg Vile: Yes. I can't disclose any details, but suffice to say he's exceptionally rich — so don't even think about trying to out-bid him.
 You trade your time...?
Media:vo hyeq002 9 vile 03b.ogg Vile: Of course I do. All work is just selling your labor hours. The intelligence business is no different.
Media:vo hyeq002 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wait, but... shouldn't informants only share their intel with one person?
Media:vo hyeq002 9 vile 04.ogg Vile: Maybe in an ideal world, but business is business at the end of the day, and if you only have one partnership, you'll eventually starve to death.
Media:vo hyeq002 9 vile 05.ogg Vile: The Knights of Favonius are sticklers for a principle, but even they have a practice of obtaining intelligence from a minimum of two sources during large-scale operations.
Media:vo hyeq002 9 vile 06.ogg Vile: They've suffered badly from incomplete intelligence in the past. That's why people like me are so important — I'm there when they need the extra support, and I'm free to find other work when they don't.
Media:vo hyeq002 9 vile 07.ogg Vile: Here's an analogy. Imagine the Abyss Order has set up an ambush in the wilderness — a simple scouting team is unlikely to detect it.
Media:vo hyeq002 9 vile 08.ogg Vile: Next thing you know, a knight on patrol passes by, completely unsuspecting, when suddenly "Waah!" A monster jumps out and clubs him over the head with a "bish" and a "bash."
 ...Why the sound effects?
Media:vo hyeq002 9 vile 09.ogg Vile: Well, I just thought they might make the whole thing sound more realistic.
Media:vo hyeq002 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Nope, not even close! Monsters go "Yaah!" not "Waah!" And it's a "swish" and a "smash," not a "bish" and a "bash!"
Media:vo hyeq002 9 vile 10.ogg Vile: Don't be so single-minded... You can think what you want, of course, but it can't hurt to keep my version on file as alternative intel.
Media:vo hyeq002 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh? Hmm, guess that makes sense...
Media:vo hyeq002 9 vile 11.ogg Vile: Anyway, to get back to the point... buyers are demanding multiple sources, and it's only fair that informants are free to serve multiple clients too, don't you think?
