Dialogue[]

Shani: Ah, it's you. We meet again.
 Same as always?
Shani: You could say so, but it does also feel like something has changed.
Shani: I mean, I still talk and do things the same way, but I feel a lot more relaxed, you know?
Shani: Take what's happening now, for example. I can say this, and I really mean it — I really envy you for your traveling lifestyle.
Shani: If I had the chance to go to a place where no one cared about the Dendro Archon or King Deshret, I think I would have been a lot freer.
 You'll get the chance one day.
Shani: Perhaps.
Shani: Part of me thinks that the misconceptions of our history and belief were built up over so many years that it's become difficult to change... But another part of me wishes for a change to happen.
Shani: ...Heh, let's not dwell on such heavy topics.
Shani: Let me give you some good news. Due to the previous incident, the village head has arranged a night watch at the Village Keepers' dwelling.
Shani: They have helped Aaru Village, after all. It's only right that the village also does its part to ensure their safety.
 I wish you luck.
Shani: Yes, thank you for your well wishes.
