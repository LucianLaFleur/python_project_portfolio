 The work...

Dialogue[]

Maupoil: How come there are so many people working, and yet there's still so much work to do?
 About a guard's duties...
Maupoil: Oh, I don't have any complaints about working as a guard. I just wish people would be more diligent in their work, that's all.
Maupoil: Estienne in particular... I sometimes feel scared he's going to have another one of his so-called "bright ideas." If he has to have them, I wish he'd do it while I'm on vacation... a long vacation.
 Why not take a vacation?
Maupoil: But I haven't finished my work yet... I know that everything in the Fortress will keep running without me. But I can't stop worrying...
Maupoil: I need to see everything resolved with my own eyes, and ideally solve each problem personally! It's the only way I can get a good night's sleep.
 But will the work ever be finished?
Maupoil: Of course not. So I can't stop working and I can't get a good night's sleep either.
 Thanks for your time.
Maupoil: I'd better get on with my work.
