Appearance[]
Takahashi wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the ashigaru (Japanese: 足軽) of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient shitagi with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray kobakama, and waraji sandals without the socks. Although not visible, the Sangonomiya Clan's crest is imprinted on the back of the shitagi, below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with sode (shoulder armor), han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it. Oozumi is equipped with a juumonji yari, whose shaft is colored with a red-white gradient and has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest under the spearhead.

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing Warriors' Dreams Like Spring Grass Renewing)
Takahashi: Ah, when do you think this war will end, eh...
Takahashi: I am willing to do anything to keep my sister safe, but I don't want to fight this war.
 About your sister...
Takahashi: Yeah, I have a very cute little sister. She is currently back home on Watatsumi Island.
Takahashi: My sister is still young, but she is very clever and understanding. As her big brother, I hope that she can remain innocent and pure, I really don't want her to find out about the ugly side of this world.
Takahashi: Didn't someone say that there is no winner in a war? As long as there is conflict, people will get hurt.
Takahashi: Therefore, I have to stay here and fight for the sake of my sister's safety even though I hate fighting. I shall not let the Shogunate's army set foot upon my homeland.
 About your homeland...
Takahashi: My family spent many generations in Bourou Village on Watatsumi Island. It's a small village with beautiful scenery, and people lead peaceful lives there.
Takahashi: When I was small, I would often listen to the sound of waterfalls nearby. I would stay there for the whole day...
Takahashi: If it wasn't for this war, I probably would never have left my home and would have just spent a quiet, peaceful life there instead...
 Goodbye.
Takahashi: Goodbye. I hope my little sister at home is doing well...

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After completing Warriors' Dreams Like Spring Grass Renewing)
Takahashi: Sangonomiya and the Shogunate have signed their ceasefire agreement. Guess we shouldn't expect a resumption of the conflict any time soon.
Takahashi: I just hope I can return to see my sister soon.
 About your sister...
Takahashi: Yeah, I have a very cute little sister. She is currently back home on Watatsumi Island.
Takahashi: My sister is still young, but she is very clever and understanding. As her big brother, I hope that she can remain innocent and pure even as she grows up healthy and strong.
Takahashi: I will do my best to keep the peace for her sake as well. The Shogun's Army will not set foot on our homeland — not if I have anything to say about that!
 About your homeland...
(Same as before)
 Goodbye.
