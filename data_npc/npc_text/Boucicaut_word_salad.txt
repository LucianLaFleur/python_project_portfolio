Dialogue[]

Boucicaut: Do you need something, dear customer? Say the word, and I shall procure it through my connections — anything you wish.
 Let me see your wares.
Boucicaut: Of course, of course — worry not, everything you might need can be found here.
 Do you know a lot of people?
Boucicaut: Indeed, and not merely people from Fontaine, no — I have many friends from abroad.
Boucicaut: I've been a traveling merchant since I was young, but as my journey wore on, I felt that spending my days peacefully at home suited me better.
 What connections have you got?
Boucicaut: Well now, if I did tell you, I'd have another competitor in this world, now wouldn't I?
Boucicaut: Anyway, I know a friend or two in almost any corner.
Boucicaut: But don't worry, every nook is safe, and none of them are the Fortress of Meropide. A peaceful life is what I desire, not one afoul of the law.
 I'll pass for now.
Boucicaut: Alright, but I do hope that this will become your one-stop-shop someday.
