Dialogue[]

Glory: I don't recognize that voice... Are you a traveler from afar?
Glory: Though I can't see, I'm always here to listen if there's anything you need.
 About Stormterror... 
(After completing A Long Shot)
Glory: I obviously couldn't see what happened in Mondstadt when Stormterror attacked, so I only know what other people have told me.
Glory: People's voices were full of fear during that time, but recently the sounds of anguish have finally died down.
Glory: Mondstadt's wind, too, has finally calmed down again.
 Who are you?
Glory: Sorry, where are my manners! Allow me to introduce myself — I'm Glory.
Glory: I come here often, waiting for Godwin to come back... I pray he manages to avoid those rotten hilichurls and the Abyss Order on the way... so he can come back and be with me soon.
Glory: Ah, I'm rambling again... Sorry, it's just so nice having someone to talk to.
 Who is Godwin?
Glory: He's the man I love. He's with the Knights, and he's away with Grand Master Varka's expedition.
Glory: It was hard to let him go, but I was so proud of him managing to join Varka's expedition party.
Glory: ...Sadly, I don't know when the expedition is supposed to end. All I can do is wait here for him.
 Tell me more about the hilichurls and the Abyss Order.
Glory: You must find them a nuisance too? All they do is go round [sic] causing mischief.
Glory: I heard that most of the hilichurls suddenly appeared in Teyvat out of nowhere several hundred years ago... And the same for the Abyss Order, actually.
Glory: Some said they were borne of some great catastrophe that descended on Teyvat... But I think they probably came from outer space!
Glory: ...Sorry, because I can't see my imagination sometimes runs a bit wild. Just ignore it.
 It must be difficult not being able to see.
Glory: Yes... Especially at the beginning, it was hard to adjust.
Glory: But when you can't see, your sense of hearing becomes stronger. Now, when the wind brushes past my ears, I can almost picture certain things in my mind's eye...
Glory: And since putting my faith in Lord Barbatos, I sometimes hear the whisper of a soothing voice carried on the wind.
Glory: My mother — or "Sister Grace" to everyone else — always tells me that Mondstadt is looked after by the Anemo Archon. I think she's right, you know.
 Goodbye.
Glory: Bye-bye.
Glory: Hope you enjoy your stay in Mondstadt.

Event Dialogue[]
Invitation of Windblume[]

Glory: Huh? I recognize that voice... Traveler?
Glory: The Windblume festivities are in full swing! If you get time, do make sure to roam around. You'll find a very different Mondstadt.
Glory: Even better, if there's someone important to you, you should spend the festival with them. That's where the Windblume feeling truly resides...
Glory: I always used to spend the Windblume Festival with my family and my darling Godwin. How I cherish those sweet times...
Glory: I still don't know how he's getting on... May the winds protect him.

Of Ballads and Brews[]

Glory: I've never heard your voice before... Are you a traveler who came here to participate in Weinlesefest?
Glory: Welcome. I hope you enjoy the festival as much as I do.
Glory: Although I can't see to celebrate with everyone else, this festival brings me the best news of all: that all is well with the Knights of Favonius'  expedition...

Windblume's Breath[]

Glory: Huh? I recognize this voice... Traveler?
Glory: The Windblume festivities are in full swing! If you get time, do make sure to roam around. You'll find a very different Mondstadt.
Glory: Even better, if there's someone important to you, you should spend the festival with them. That's where the Windblume spirit truly resides...
Glory: The Windblume Festival is a celebration of comfort and warmth. If possible, I wish I could spend this time with my beloved, Godwin...
Glory: I still don't know how he's getting on... May the winds protect him.
