Profile[]
Hiiragi Shinsuke is the head of the Hiiragi Clan and is the Kanjou Commissioner. When the Fatui arrived on Inazuma to cause havoc, they also conspired with Kujou Takayuki, the Tenryou Commissioner to manipulate the Raiden Shogun to enact the Vision Hunt Decree and Sakoku Decree to create a market for Delusions. Shinsuke was also roped into the plot and promised power and wealth, which he accepted by stockpiling Crystal Marrow for the Fatui.
Shinsuke met with Signora prior to the Traveler's arrival on Ritou and plotted with her to keep them indefinitely stuck on the island to prevent them from meddling in their affairs. This failed due to his daughter, Chisato, who overheard them and snuck the Traveler off Ritou under the guise of an escort. After the Traveler unraveled the plot, Shinsuke was imprisoned for his role and is awaiting punishment from the Shogun.

Appearance[]
Shinsuke wears a gray kimono with a black hakama (trousers) and a red haori (jacket worn over a kimono).
