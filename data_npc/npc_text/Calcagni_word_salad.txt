Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Masquerade of the Guilty.


Calcagni: You may easily have time, but you will not easily obtain perfume made by Ms. Emilie.
 Perfume?
Calcagni: Fragrance is no mere scent. It is a lifestyle. It is what we leave behind in living's wake.
Calcagni: Do you think such aromas dissipate all too easily? I will not deny that.
Calcagni: But why, then, do they find new life within our dreams?
 Tell me about Emilie.
Calcagni: She moves much like perfume herself. You cannot reach her, nor can she be stopped.
Calcagni: She is not employed by the Confrerie of Cabriere, nor does she work with any fixed brand.
Calcagni: But still, she remains the most famous perfume designer in Fontaine. The elegant, fashionable ladies of Fontaine would even give a precious gem for her perfume.
Calcagni: Too exaggerated for your ears?
Calcagni: Hmm... in that case, simply take it as if I added a "so I've heard" to that statement.
 I've no use for perfume for now...
Calcagni: The tide is ever-changing, but fragrance ever lingers.
