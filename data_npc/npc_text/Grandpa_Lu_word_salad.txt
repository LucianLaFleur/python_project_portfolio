Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

Grandpa Lu: The tea doesn't taste right.
 What's wrong with it?
Grandpa Lu: Hmm... I don't know how to describe it, but there's been something missing in the tea in our village recently.
Grandpa Lu: I don't know much about growing tea, but Luo has been worried sick. He's been running between the field and the warehouse, trying to find out what's happening. He's also been yelling at Jin quite a bit, poor guy...
Grandpa Lu: Well, it's almost time to make the tea offering to the adeptus, and the merchants are coming, too. Not a good time for us to have trouble with the tea...
 Um, those who drink it aren't going to get sick, right?
Grandpa Lu: No, nothing like that. It's just lacking in flavor.
Grandpa Lu: Even so, our tea leaves are still loads better than those you'll find in other places.
Grandpa Lu: But knowing Luo... He won't let anything below his standards enter the warehouse.
Grandpa Lu: He's going to be tea-wrangling for a couple of days.
 Goodbye.
Grandpa Lu: Take it easy, alright? The passages in the mountains are treacherous, so be careful.

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After completing An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade)
Grandpa Lu: Greetings! Thanks to you, our water and soil can grow delicious tea again!
 You will be able to enjoy the tea, too.
Grandpa Lu: Indeed! And good tea makes for a happy me, hahaha!
Grandpa Lu: And I suppose Luo can finally get a good night's sleep...
 How has Uncle Luo been?
Grandpa Lu: Luo? He's been going down to the fields, making business deals, checking inventory... Basically, he's either sleeping or working.
Grandpa Lu: And he still takes it out on Jin all the time.
Grandpa Lu: I have to say, though, that while he might make mistakes from time to time, he's willing to learn, and that makes him a good egg. Luo can be mean sometimes, but he's training Jin as his successor in earnest.
Grandpa Lu: It's up to Jin himself whether he can stand Luo's temper or not.
 Please take care of yourself.
Grandpa Lu: Don't worry about me. I'm doing great. I can probably stir-fry tea leaves for another ten years, at least.
Grandpa Lu: But you... Always working, rushing from one place to another. Do you even have time to drink water? Let alone tea...
Grandpa Lu: The way I see it, you young people should be working hard, but not at the cost of your health.
Grandpa Lu: Come see me in the village whenever you're free. I've got several compressed teabricks that have been aging for decades, and I haven't sold them, no matter what price was offered. When you come back next time, we'll drink from that stash! How about that?
 Goodbye.
Grandpa Lu: Leaving already? Alright, sure, but take care on those treacherous mountain roads!
