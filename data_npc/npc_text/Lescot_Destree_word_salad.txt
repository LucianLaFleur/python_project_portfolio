Profile[]
According to accounts heard by Delaroche, Lescot was only 8 when he tied a bunch of heavy seashells to his body and walked into the water, never to return again. This occurred a month before the events of Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures. His family took on the name after moving into the city as they originated from a place called Destree. His father passed away in an accident years ago too.[1]
