Dialogue[]

Soheil: Young scholars are so impetuous these days...
 Still all hot and bothered over here?
Soheil: Why, yes! And what do I have to blame for that, but young researchers continuing to try to worm their way into the desert?
Soheil: Thanks to them, Hulwani and I have to do a few rounds around this place every single day. The heat's turning my legs to jelly over here — and I haven't had any time to really look into the stone slates you brought back. For shame!
Soheil: *sigh* When can I get back to the Akademiya...
 See you.
Soheil: See you. May you have safe travels.
