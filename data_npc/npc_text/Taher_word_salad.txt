Dialogue[]

Taher: Is doing business really all that great?
 Perhaps.
Taher: I don't get what the point of selling this useless, gaudy stuff is. Maybe that's because I'm a bumpkin from the desert.
Taher: Besides, these city folks doing business don't look too happy to me, either.
Taher: Nine out of ten people who come out of the exchange look miserable, and the tenth will be bawling their eyes out.
Taher: I also hear that there are students who think they can make it big by learning a few things. They come to try their luck, but end up forking over a year's worth of living expenses. Don't be like them!
 I'm not sure.
Taher: Well, I'm not keen on trying to figure them out either.
