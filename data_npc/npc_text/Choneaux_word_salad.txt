 Not a bad headline...

Dialogue[]

Choneaux: What are you doing, eavesdropping on me? Beat it!
 Adventure Challenge
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Choneaux: Please state your full name and title. The results of our duel will be published in next issue's Genius Invokation TCG column.
(If the player wins the match)

Choneaux: I lost... Hmm, perhaps it'd be best if this one stayed out of the papers?
 I didn't even hear what you said.
Choneaux: Phew... Last time, some punk stole my exclusive scoop!
Choneaux: That was gonna net me a whole lotta Mora! Once I catch him, I'll make sure to send him to the Fortress of Meropide.
Choneaux: It doesn't matter. I already have something new, and this one's gonna belong to me and me alone for sure!
 You really care about exclusives...
Choneaux: Exclusives mean a big payout. You're not in our line of work, are you?
Choneaux: As long as I'm the only one with the scoop, I can negotiate and sell it to the highest bidder.
Choneaux: There were even some media folks who came to find me, hoping to buy out my info.
Choneaux: They said something about... how it would tarnish their reputation and cause trouble if it got published...
 And what did you do?
Choneaux: Hahaha! I made a handsome profit off it, that's for sure! But I'm not totally without moral scruples. Once someone buys a story from me, I won't turn around and try to sell it to someone else under a different name.
Choneaux: Alright, I've talked enough. I need to think about how to make this report connect with more readers.
 ...Bye.
Choneaux: How should I revise this report...
