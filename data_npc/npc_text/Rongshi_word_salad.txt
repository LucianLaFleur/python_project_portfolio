Profile[]
Rongshi partook in the Crux Clash, but only in the hopes of finding a worthy opponent to battle. He is the Traveler's opponent in the semi-finals of The Crux Clash. Despite outmatching them in sheer strength, he is ultimately bested by the Traveler's quick thinking. Rongshi concedes, happy to have found a worthy opponent and wishes to challenge them sometime again in the future.
