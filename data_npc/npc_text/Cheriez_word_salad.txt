Dialogue[]

Cheriez: That gentleman from Sumeru seems to be a real careful sort. He'll be fine even if I don't guide him, I reckon.
 Is there anything of note nearby?
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Cheriez knows)

Cheriez: I just bumped into an old friend, who said he saw a place with loads of Condessence Crystals on the way here. There was even some Magical Crystal Ore!
Cheriez: Now, I was in the ore business for a while myself, but not any longer. If you need some, I'd say... this place is a good shout.
(Rich Ore Reserve marked on the map)
(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Cheriez knows)

Cheriez: If you're not here to hitch a boat ride, there really isn't any reason to stay. How about sailing to the city?
 A gentleman from Sumeru?
Cheriez: Yes. He seems to work at the Akademiya, and decided to travel here during a vacation.
Cheriez: I've heard that he's very meticulous in research and in life. He found me through several layers of relationships, and invited me to be his guide.
Cheriez: Which is fine, of course. I've got lots of free time, so I can accompany him anywhere.
Cheriez: But compared to traveling itself, he seems to enjoy designing itineraries more — he even wanted to carefully calculate the length of aquabus rides.
 I can help to speed him up.
Cheriez: It's okay. I don't mean to rush him. It is a good thing to think carefully while making plans for the future and then slowly enjoying the rest of it.
Cheriez: It's just that he seems to be a bit too preoccupied and forgot to have some of the bread that I brought for him. I can't finish the bread alone. Would you like to share it with me?
(Obtain  Garlic Baguette ×3)
 See you.
Cheriez: See you.
