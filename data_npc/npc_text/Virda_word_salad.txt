Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

Virda: I've got to do my best in training... Huh? I don't think I've seen you before. Who are you? Ah, wait, no, let me guess.
Virda: You're tall, and you look completely different from us Melusines... I know. You must be from outside the village!
 A deduction most brilliant...
Virda: I—I mean, I'm just a trainee... That's why my skills are still lacking.
Virda: But I've been training diligently every day. One day soon, I'll be able to officially join the Marechaussee Phantom!
 Why do you need to do special training?
Virda: Well, to join the Marechaussee Phantom, of course. Monsieur Neuvillette says that we all have the potential to become Marechaussee agents...
Virda: But you have to undergo strict assessments to become a member for real, so I have to work hard!
 Why do you want to join the Marechaussee Phantom?
Virda: Because I want to defend justice as one of their members — and also, their official uniform is super cool.
Virda: Oh yes — my favorite character in "Great Detective Hurlock" is Agent Gina of the Marechaussee Phantom.
Virda: Although her deductions are often full of holes, the effort she puts in to catch criminals for the sake of her future is very inspiring indeed!
Virda: So yes, I dream of becoming a member of the Marechaussee Phantom!
 You can do it!
Virda: Yup, I'll do my best!

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Ancient Colors.


Virda: It seems I'll need to try harder... Ah yes, thanks for your help previously!
Virda: Hehehe, I was able to help everyone out, and Sedile even praised me — is this my special training paying off?
 Why do you need to do special training?
(Same as before)
 Could you tell me what happened to the Eremites from earlier?
Virda: Oh, sure. Sedile contacted the Gardes. They should be in the Maison Gardiennage's custody by now.
Virda: Sedile said that the Marechaussee Phantom is in charge of finding the bad guys — and in the cases that they've been found, we can just directly hand them over to the Maison!
 Why do you want to join the Marechaussee Phantom?
(Same as before)
 Keep up the good work.
Virda: Yup, I'll do my best!
