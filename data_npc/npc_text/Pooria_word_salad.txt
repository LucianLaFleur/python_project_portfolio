Dialogue[]

Pooria: There is nothing more enjoyable than making matching jewelry for newlyweds.
 And you are...
Pooria: I live near the market. I'm a craftsman who works with gold.
Pooria: I've been doing this my whole life, and I created all sorts of gold pieces, big and small, of various values, but I like making jewelry for newlyweds the most.
Pooria: When a young couple holds the newly-made gold jewelry, their faces shine brighter than gold. I feel happy watching such moments.
Pooria: It's just that I'm a little short-sighted lately, so I can't see well when drawing... Do you think I should take on an apprentice?
 See you.
Pooria: Farewell. It's nice to be young.
