Event Dialogue[]

(Before completing Opening Festivities)
Bahar: Are... these stories still too complex?

(After completing In Truth's Steps)
Bahar: Well then, would you like to give "In Truth's Steps" a go?
 Yes.
Bahar: Good, good. In that case, lend me your ears.
 I've got something else to do at the moment.
Bahar: That's alright. I'll be here, and you can come back whenever you'd like to have a go.
