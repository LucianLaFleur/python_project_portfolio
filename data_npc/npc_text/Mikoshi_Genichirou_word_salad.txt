Mikoshi Genichirou's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Genichirou is a member of the Mikoshi Clan, a clan with oni heritage, and the older brother of Mikoshi Genjirou. Considered to be dull, simple and sluggish by those familiar with him, he chose to open up Netsuke no Gen Crafts to help his neighbors out with his handiwork. By the time the Traveler arrived, his store had just run out of stock for the time being. Part of the reason for this is likely because Netsuke no Gen Crafts does not have much storage space, which results in frequent supply shortages.[1]

Dialogue[]

Mikoshi Genichirou: Hello, see anything you like? If you can't find the right one, I can have one custom-made for you.
 I'd like to buy a few things... (Before reaching Sakura Level 50)
Mikoshi Genichirou: Let me see what you need, dear customer...
Mikoshi Genichirou: Ah, my sincere apologies, but we are still in the midst of arranging for the goods that you require.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Our capacities are limited, and it will take some time for the goods to be restocked, so please do come again then.
 I'd like to get some souvenirs. (After reaching Sakura Level 50)
Mikoshi Genichirou: Be my guest. Just let me know when you see something you like.
(Opens Souvenir Shop)
 Do you have any special goods here?
Mikoshi Genichirou: I do have some consignments that I was given. Will they be to your liking, I wonder?

Mikoshi Genichirou: It looks like you missed a few details...
(If the player wins the match)

Mikoshi Genichirou: Haha, impressive. I didn't expect you to be so adaptable..
 Tell me about your store...
Mikoshi Genichirou: You mean where the name of this store came from?
Mikoshi Genichirou: Haha, I see you're not from Inazuma.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Netsuke is a kind of small craftwork that the Inazumans carry with them as pendants. Generally, they are carved into different shapes based on the owner's preference.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Take this one for instance. If you cross the rope from the inner side of the belt and then hang a coin pouch, seal or stamp on it, the netsuke will be stuck onto the belt. Convenient, eh?
Mikoshi Genichirou: As for the "Gen" part of the name... Well, it's my name, actually.
 What can you make to order?
Mikoshi Genichirou: What would you like? Just tell me, and I will do my best to make it happen.
Mikoshi Genichirou: This store may not be as famous as those old family stores on this street, but we are still proud of our fine craftmanship.
Mikoshi Genichirou: To be honest, I'm actually the eldest son of my family, but people always say that I am simple and dull, and that I probably won't be able to carry on with the family business.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Haha, that's why I would rather start a small store here and help the neighbors out with my handiwork.
 Thank you! Goodbye.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Goodbye! Come back next time if you need anything.
