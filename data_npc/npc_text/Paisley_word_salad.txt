Profile[]
Unlike Roger and Nelson, Paisley likes neither cat toys, nor cat food. He doesn't fancy anything special, and does whatever he's in the mood for. At the tavern, he doesn't interact much with the customers and ignores strangers, preferring to play with the other cats instead. Diona calls him a self-centered little cat.[1]
