Dialogue[]

Fodil: Hello.
 Adventure Challenge
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Fodil: It's alright. I play pretty often in my downtime. Losing to me is no big deal.
(If the player wins the match)

Fodil: Not bad! I'd say you're one of the best players out here in the desert!
 So, what's up ahead?
Fodil: It depends what you mean by "up ahead."
Fodil: On one side, you have Aaru Village. As you can see, it is a village bordering the desert, and is home to us, the people of the desert.
Fodil: Though we are cut off by the Wall of Samiel, this is still a safe place that welcomes those who wish for rest.
Fodil: Travel can be exhausting, and the desert is perilous. If you wish to stop for rest during your journey, this is the place to be.
 What about the other side?
Fodil: That place is unfamiliar to me.
Fodil: When I was still working with the Eremites, I did go to Port Ormos several times, but all the work we got usually involved... kicking people while they were down.
Fodil: I decided it wasn't for me, so I left. I've never left the village since then.
Fodil: The only things I learned there that are worth mentioning are things I learned from the school of hard knocks.
Fodil: And well, now I use them to protect the village. That suits me just fine.
 Could you tell me more about yourself?
Fodil: If you're looking to get some intel on the pretext of small talk, then you've come to the wrong person.
Fodil: In any case, Aaru Village has never been home to any secrets.
Fodil: This is a place of exile for the Akademiya. Most people struggle to even make ends meet — never mind have any manner of strange thoughts.
Fodil: Secondly, we, the desert people, consider this place our final home. We will defend it no matter the cost.
Fodil: So it doesn't matter what your reasons are — if you threaten the stability of the village, we, the Aaru Village guards, will take action against you without a second thought.
 Yeah.
Fodil: Good. Safe travels, then.
