Dialogue[]

Master Lu: Welcome to the Fanmu Carpenter's, one of the oldest carpentry workshops in Qingce Village!
Master Lu: You name it, I build it, whether it's a yo-yo or a new house!
 Could you help me with some furnishings?
Master Lu: Hmm? You want some furnishings made? Well, it just so happens that the Fanmu Carpenter's have got some new blueprints in. Feel free to take a look through them...

(If the player loses the match)

Master Lu: Playing with you was rather relaxing indeed. Let's have another round sometime!
(If the player wins the match)

Master Lu: Good, good! Young people are indeed good at cards!
 A carpentry workshop?
Master Lu: That's right! It began as my grandfather's grandfather's workshop and it's stayed in the family ever since.
Master Lu: Chang the Ninth's residence? The Fanmu Carpenter's built that. The village mill? We built that too!
Master Lu: Even the Qixing come to us when they need some new furniture built to order.
 About apprenticeships...
(Before completing On the Stage, Behind the Stage)
Master Lu: *sigh* You must have overheard me grumbling then...
Master Lu: I'm getting old now, and a lifetime of toiling away in this workshop has started to take its toll on the old joints...
Master Lu: Lately I've been thinking — it's time for me to take on an apprentice. Pass on what I've learned. Secure the future of the Fanmu Carpenter's.
Master Lu: Don't s'pose you have any interest in woodwork yourself? The thought of turning a chunk raw timber intro a polished masterpiece by your own handiwork... appeal to you at all?
 Yes, Master!
Master Lu: Really? Do you mean it?
Master Lu: I don't know... You seem to me to have itchy feet. Places you have to go, things you have to do.
Master Lu: How about you do what you've gotta do first. If when you come back I'm still around, then as long as I've got strength in my bones I'll be glad to take you on.
Master Lu: When that time comes, I will devote myself fully to passing on everything I know. All the tricks of the trade of the Fanmu Carpenter's will be yours.
 No thanks
Master Lu: What a pity. You'll never know the joy of working with wood.
Master Lu: Well, never mind. It's clear that you've got places to go, things to do.
Master Lu: When you've done what you've gotta do, though... do come and find me if you change your mind.
Master Lu: I'd devote myself fully to passing on everything I know. All the tricks of the trade of the Fanmu Carpenter's they're yours to take if you want them.
(After completing On the Stage, Behind the Stage)
Master Lu: Ah, you must have overheard me grumbling, then?
Master Lu: Haha, my new apprentice, Dayu, is quite quick with his hands, and he's hardworking enough. He just talks too much.
Master Lu: Carpenters like us should just focus on getting the work done with our own two hands. No need to flap those lips unnecessarily.
Master Lu: That kid is pretty unreliable in that regard. Perhaps I should get myself another apprentice...
Master Lu: I mean, with the two of them helping and covering for each others' weaknesses, the future of Fanmu Carpenter's will be secure.
Master Lu: ...Speaking of which, would you be interested in carpentry?
 Yes, Master!
Master Lu: Really? Do you mean it?
Master Lu: I don't know... You seem to me to have itchy feet. Places you have to go, things you have to do.
Master Lu: How about you do what you've gotta do first. If I'm sill around when you come back, then I'll be glad to take you on, so long as I've got strength in my bones.
Master Lu: When that time comes, I will devote myself fully to passing on everything I know. All the tricks of the trade of the Fanmu Carpenter's will be yours.
 No thanks.
Master Lu: What a pity. You'll never know the joy of working with wood.
Master Lu: Well, never mind. It's clear that you've got places to go, things to do.
Master Lu: When you've done what you've gotta do, though... do come and find me if you change your mind.
Master Lu: I'd devote myself fully to passing on everything I know. All the tricks of the trade of the Fanmu Carpenter shall be yours to take if you want them.
 Goodbye.
Master Lu: Leaving so soon? *sigh* Seems like for every new customer I get, I lose another one...
