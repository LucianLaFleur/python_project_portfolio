Idle Quotes[]

 You can find everything...
Media:VO Aoi 01.ogg "You can find everything and anything in Tsukumomono Groceries."

Dialogue[]

Aoi: Tsukumomono Groceries. All your wishes granted in this one place!
 I'd like to make a purchase.
Aoi: Your wish is my command. Please, pick anything you like.
(Opens Tsukumomono Groceries wares)
 You sell everything here, you mean?
Aoi: That's right. "Tsukomomono" itself means "having almost everything." Similarly, our shop is dedicated to fulfilling the wishes of every customer.
Aoi: Which means that as long as can you [sic] offer the right price, you can buy anything.
Aoi: Hehe... and as for how we got the goods. I'm afraid I cannot disclose that.
 One new Paimon, please.
Aoi: Pai... mon? Oh, what is this? A flying doll that makes noises? Is... is this some antique imbued with genjutsu, by any chance?
Aoi: Sorry, this is indeed a little... Please wait, dear customer. I shall have to consult my sources...
 See you.
Aoi: Goodbye! Tsukumomono Groceries will be at your service anytime.

Event Dialogue[]
Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness[]

 We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.
Aoi: How strange. No one's ever invited me to go attend such an event before.
Paimon: Well, that's why we're here! Hehe.
Paimon: You must have music you really love, right, Aoi? We could play it for you — we're serious musicians!
Aoi: Music, you say? Well... There is one that I heard a long while back. I was your height when I last heard it, I believe.
Aoi: I only remember bits and pieces of it, but could you play it for me all the same?
 Sure, I'll give it a go.
Aoi: Thank you.
(After performing)

Aoi: Ah... Lovely. It seems you're quite the dab hand at making others' wishes come true.
Aoi: It's been almost twenty years since I last heard this tune. It was a boy in the neighborhood who played it for me.
Aoi: His wish was to travel and see the outside world... It's just a shame that I couldn't have been the one to help him.
Aoi: Heh, well, would you look at that? I've strayed from the topic. I'm afraid I can't help with this music festival. Tsukumomono Groceries can't do without me right now.
Aoi: Still, I'm glad to have heard this once more. Thank you so much.
(Talk to Aoi again, optional)
 How was that?
(Same as After performing)
