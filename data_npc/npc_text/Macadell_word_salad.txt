Macadell: *sigh* There's no way I'm modifying the prototype with how things are now...
 About the Portable Mini Pneumousia Storage Device...
Macadell: This Portable Mini Pneumousia Storage Device prototype is the result of the research of my project team.
Macadell: Our team's research went swimmingly at first, and everything was normal... But who could have guessed that an explosion would suddenly rock the Fontaine Research Institute?
Macadell: Many researchers from our group were caught in the blast, and the majority of our research materials were a complete loss...
Macadell: Now, apart from me, there's basically nobody else who can continue the work and push the research forward.
Macadell: To save our project, I've got to prove the value of this prototype as soon as I can.
Macadell: But... who knew something like this would happen? Just where is the issue...
 About the machine's output issue...
Macadell: Because this Portable Mini Pneumousia Storage Device prototype is having a few minor issues...
Macadell: It's [sic] external power output fluctuates when connected to the Pressurized Impactor.
Macadell: This kind of unstable energy output is even destabilizing the Pressurized Impactor's output strength.
Macadell: When the output is high, this machine can easily crush rocks. But when output is low, even drilling a hole in mud is challenging.
Macadell: Ugh... Although, I must stress that even though this machine is having output stability issues...
Macadell: It is still extremely safe. Even if you don't turn it on during the energy output peak, at most the Impactor will also have low output.
Macadell: There is absolutely no chance of it exploding, catching fire, leaking energy, the casing melting, or anything else of the sort... so please don't worry.
 See you.
Macadell: See you later. Please don't forget to help me test the device! Thanks!
