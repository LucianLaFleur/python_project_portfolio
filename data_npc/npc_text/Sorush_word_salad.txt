Profile[]
Sorush is one of the Pari, a race of avian, flower-like creatures. She was born after the cataclysm. Pari came to work with the Order of Skeptics, believing Nasejuna's claims that by sacrificing herself, she would be able to quell The Sign of Apaosha that appeared over the Harvisptokhm. However, to do so, she would need to become the Bloomguard, which was only possible when she acquired the Chaplet. However, she failed to acquire it from Zurvan, but was still persistent. This would change once she met the Traveler and Paimon, where she declared them her Yasnapati. By saving two other Pari, Mihir and Rashnu, Pari was eventually granted the Chaplet and became a Bloomguard.
Sorush, the Traveler and Nasejuna would discover the remaining Great Song of Khvarena that had been scattered across the area. When they acquired the last one, Nasejuna revealed his treachery and attacked with Klingsor, but the Traveler repelled both. She was initially shocked by his treachery, but was cheered back up by the Traveler and Paimon. With their help, Sorush was able to conduct the Rite of Ab-Zohr and awoke the consciousness of the god in the Gaokerena and successfully purged the Sign of Apaosh, purifying Tunigi Hollow and restoring the Harvisptokhm to its original state.
Zurvan later had several trials set for Sorush to ensure she knew the responsibilities of a Bloomguard, with the Traveler assisting her. Though she was conflicted during some of the trials, she ultimately came to realize that they were also meant to understand the mistakes she made in the past.
