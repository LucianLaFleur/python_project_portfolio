Change is the only constant.—Cyrus, Bimarstan's Proverb Column
Cyrus was a sage of great renown in Sumeru Akademiya, even having a quote on Bimarstan's Proverb Column, which contains quotes from the Akademiya's greatest scholars. As a professor, Cyrus had several students, including Lisa, Cyno, and Gafoor.[1][4]
Cyrus nearly died while exploring the Great Red Sand for research, but was saved by the Temple of Silence. Upon learning of Bamoun's plan to implant two Ba Fragments into children — Cyrus disagreed with his opinion. The two children, Cyno and Sethos, successfully resonated with the fragments, but when they began to show signs of instability, Bamoun had the fragments implanted in them before they dissipated for good. Cyrus disagreed with this and subsequently left with Cyno, damaging the organization's plans.[1] He would later raise Cyno while attending to his studies and lectures.
When Lisa entered Sumeru Akademiya, he took a liking to her work early on and deemed her to be the greatest scholar the Akademiya had seen in 200 years.[5] He invited her to join several major projects, but most of them ultimately failed due to trying to attain "wisdom beyond mortal understanding" at great cost. Disillusioned by the "lunacy" of these projects, Lisa decided to leave the Akademiya after she graduated a mere two years later. Cyrus evidently sympathized with her decision and never tried persuading her to stay.[2]
In the manga, Lisa sent a letter to her "teacher" at Sumeru Akademiya regarding an ancient language she could not decipher, found in a Fatui document pertaining to the god remains inside Collei.[6] Cyno was dispatched to Mondstadt in response,[7] and he successfully sealed the remains. Afterwards, he took Collei back to Sumeru and left her in Tighnari's care.
Following his retirement, Cyrus now resides in the Bimarstan area. His residence is seen in the Wondrous Times in Kaveh's Hangout Event: Act I - The Pendulum of Weal and Woe, where Zaha Hadi is found angrily accusing Cyrus of sabotaging her tomato plant for a competition between fellow retired professors.
Bamoun, desiring revenge against Cyrus for the damage he caused to the Temple of Silence, devised a plan with Sethos in order to lure him back and claim Cyno's fragment. They convinced a student, Urraca, to bring a damning letter to the Akademiya accusing Cyrus of fraud. The letter was also dotted with motifs of the desert, which he would recognize. As expected, Cyrus realized the intent behind the letter and set off to the desert alone, with Cyno chasing after him in the process. Cyno's friends — the Traveler, Paimon and Tighnari, went after Cyno and discovered the Temple of Silence, where they learned of Cyrus' past with the organization. Cyno, unwilling to let his foster guardian be harmed, offered to engage in a duel with Sethos for his safety, which he agreed to. Cyno and his friends ultimately won the duel, and Cyrus returned to the Akademiya afterwards, only to be scolded by Naphis for his recklessness.
After catching up with his workload, Cyrus discovered several photos of him and Cyno when they were younger, which had been taken by Lisa. After some reminiscing, Cyno suggests paying a visit to Lisa, and he agrees to do so next week, only to remember about his contest with Zaha Hadi and his desire to beat her.

Trivia[]
     Faranak's drawing; Cyrus appeared as the rightmost figure  
During Wondrous Times in Kaveh's Hangout Event: Act I - The Pendulum of Weal and Woe, Kaveh and the Traveler find Faranak's drawing of her husband with three other male acquaintances, two of whom are heavily implied to be Tighnari's and Alhaitham's fathers.  Cyrus is the rightmost man, given several context clues:
The man wears an Akademiya uniform that shows off his association with the Spantamad Darshan, the same Darshan Cyrus mentored for.
Earlier in the quest, Tighnari explains that Cyrus is Cyno's adoptive father, while Faranak's notes about the drawing notes that there were three couples present at the gathering and one single man. The three couples would be Tighnari, Kaveh, and Alhaitham's parents, while Cyno was adopted by Cyrus and thus, Cyrus does not necessarily have a wife.
Based on the above, the authorial intent is that Tighnari, Kaveh, Alhaitham, and Cyno are the "next generation" of their parents' friend group, even if by coincidence. This is reinforced by the quest's ending illustration, Leisurely Gathering, which depicts the four sitting in the same order as their fathers did in Faranak's drawing.
Etymology[]
Cyrus is the Latinized form of Greek Κῦρος Kȳros, from Old Persian 𐎤𐎢𐎽𐎢𐏁 Kūruš. The modern Persian name کوروش Kourosh, which is also the name of another Sumeru NPC, is related. Many notable Persian figures are known as Cyrus in English, including Cyrus the Great, his grandfather Cyrus I, and Cyrus the Younger.
While Mondstadt's Cyrus and the Sumpter Beast named after him use the English Latinized form or its equivalent across all localizations, Sumeru's Cyrus does not.
His name in Chinese, 居勒什 Jūlèshí, is a variation of 居鲁士 Jūlǔshì, the Chinese version of Cyrus in real life as seen in the names of Cyrus the Great, Cyrus I, and Cyrus the Younger.
His name in Japanese, ジュライセン Juraisen, is derived from a rough phonetic reading of his name in Mandarin Chinese rather than the Japanese version of Cyrus in real life, which is キュロス Kyurosu as seen in the names of Cyrus the Great, Cyrus I, and Cyrus the Younger.
His name in Korean, 키루스 Kiruseu, is the Korean version of Cyrus in real life as seen in the names of Cyrus the Great and Cyrus the Younger.
His name in Spanish, Ciro, is the Spanish Latinized form of Cyrus in real life as seen in the names of Cyrus the Great and many others.
