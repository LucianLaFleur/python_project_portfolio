Dialogue[]

Yuewen: This is such a great place to vacation in. Don't you think so?
 Did you come from Liyue?
Yuewen: Yes, I did. You can get to Port Ormos by traveling along the waterway.
Yuewen: I just unloaded a batch of cargo there and made a little money, so I planned to rest in Vimara Village for a while before traveling back to Liyue.
Yuewen: But I realized this place is such a paradise to relax in... I really can't bear to leave.
 Do you want to settle down?
Yuewen: I've been thinking about this, too.
Yuewen: Perhaps the busy old days have made me become used to running one errand after another...
Yuewen: But I heard the villagers say that there's an old saying in Sumeru — Ingenuity leads to truth and knowledge.
Yuewen: Maybe a change of mindset or lifestyle would suit me better?
(Obtain  Teachings of Ingenuity ×3)
 Indeed.
Yuewen: I see you're of the same mind. Excellent.
