Profile[]
Indarias was among those who answered Morax's summons to aid his fight against the demons that spawned from the remains of defeated gods during and after the Archon War. Of the many yakshas, Indarias was one of the five strongest alongside Bosacius, Bonanus, Menogias, and Alatus.[2]
Indarias and Bonanus appeared to be close, appearing next to each other in Bosacius' memories.
Indarias eventually succumbed to the karmic debt accrued from endless slaughter and perished. It is implied she went mad with fear and grief.
