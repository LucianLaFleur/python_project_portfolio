Profile[]
Originally hailing from Mondstadt, Werner went into the shipping business for trade between Liyue and Inazuma.[3] After the Sakoku Decree was declared, Werner was stuck on Ritou. He originally joined the International Trade Association, but soon left as he felt that he was unable to contribute.
Soon after he left, he conspired with Keijirou to sell Crystal Marrow to the association at an inflated price. Despite playing the role of seller, Werner was barely given any compensation for his activities. Kurisu sent the Traveler to investigate on his behalf, but only after advice from Thoma did the Traveler learn of his origins. Giving him items from both Mondstadt and Liyue, Werner soon admitted he was wrong and exposed Keijirou's misdeeds to them. While not known, it is suggested that he later reconciled with the International Trade Association as he felt ashamed of conning them at the time.
