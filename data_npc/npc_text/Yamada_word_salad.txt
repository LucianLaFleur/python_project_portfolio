Idle Quotes[]

 What? Another bad one...
Media:VO Yamada 01.ogg "What? Another bad one? No, let me try again."

Dialogue[]

Yamada: Hmm? Is there something you need? If not, I need to get back to my slips.
 What are you doing?
(Before completing Transient Dreams)

Yamada: I am drawing fortune slips. I wish that the Almighty Shogun will change her mind and lift the Sakoku Decree soon...
Yamada: But I have already drawn slips several times. They either read "Misfortune" or "Great Misfortune"! Alas, what an awful day!
Yamada: Because of the restrictions of the Sakoku Decree, I can no longer sail out for business. The goods I have now are all stuck.
Yamada: Business has not been smooth at all, and even the Grand Narukami Shrine can't save me... Is it because my luck can't get better after I witnessed that event?
Yamada: No, no way! I can't give up now! No matter how many times it takes, I will get a good slip before I leave!
(After completing Transient Dreams)

Yamada: I'm here to get a fortune slip to see what the future holds for my business...
Yamada: Originally, I thought that I'd now be able to leave the country and make a big profit doing business, but all the slips I've drawn have "Misfortune" on them...
Yamada: Business has not been smooth at all, and even the Grand Narukami Shrine can't save me... Is it because my luck can't get better after I witnessed that event?
Yamada: No, no way! I can't give up now! No matter how many times it takes, I will obtain a positive sign before I leave!
 What event are you referring to?
Yamada: It's something that happened after the Vision Hunt Decree came out. Someone bit off more than he could chew by challenging the Vision Hunt Decree enforcers from the Tenryou Commission to a duel before the throne.
Yamada: Naturally, this imprudent guy was promptly defeated and received divine punishment from the Almighty Shogun... *sigh* What an awful way to go, now that I think about it...
Yamada: But to everyone's surprise, the Vision that the defeated man had lost was taken away by another young lad who barged onto the scene!
Yamada: That Vision, which should have become part of the statue of the Almighty Shogun, is now in the hands of some unknown ronin... Alas, what a terrible omen!
 I won't disturb you then.
Yamada: Please, oh please, let the next slip be good...
