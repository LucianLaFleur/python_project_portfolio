Rostam was a knight in the Knights of Favonius around 500 years ago, famed as the "Wolf Pup." He developed Favonius Bladework, the Knights of Favonius' sword style which is still practiced to this day.[1][2]
Rostam was the close friend and rival of the Grand Master of the time, Arundolyn, the mentor of the Bloodstained Knight,[3][4] and the lover of Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter. Arundolyn and Rosalyne were greatly affected by Rostam's untimely demise during the cataclysm 500 years ago.
Rostam is the central character of the artifact set Defender's Will and partially narrates the description for Elegy for the End.

Profile[]
Rostam was friends and rivals with Arundolyn, forging a bond strong enough that, after he was slain in battle, Arundolyn never entered combat again out of grief. He was in mutual love with Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter. later known as the Crimson Witch of Flame and after that, joining the Fatui as the Eighth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, La Signora.
Rostam wielded a sword in battle, and his combat style is still practiced by the Knights of Favonius to this day.[2] He also mentored the White Knight, whose pursuit of uncompromising justice eventually turned him into the Bloodstained Knight.[4]

Story[]
Early Life[]
Rostam and Arundolyn spent most of their childhood together, first as playmates and then as fellow knights and close friends.[5] After joining the Knights of Favonius, Rostam mentored the White Knight. He also fell in love with a maiden named Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter, who often sang in the city square,[3][6] and gifted her with a Hydro timepiece before she left to study at Sumeru Akademiya.[7]
Despite being a Knight of Favonius, Rostam did not shy away from doing dirty work in the background — it is said that he even inherited Kreuzlied's secret society, which was formed 1,000 years ago to help Vennessa overthrow the Aristocracy.[8]

Death[]
After the fall of Khaenri'ah's Eclipse Dynasty and the cataclysm that followed, Rostam embarked on an expedition with the Knights of Favonius to exterminate monsters that spewed forth. However, he died in battle, ending his career as a knight of Favonius after 23 years of service.[5][9]
Following his death, Arundolyn never took up the sword again. Meanwhile, Rosalyne returned to her hometown in Mondstadt only to find it destroyed by monsters and Rostam dead. Out of a desire for revenge, she used liquid fire to transfigure herself and became known as the Crimson Witch of Embers.[6][10] Rosalyne would later eventually join the Fatui and become La Signora.[11]

Trivia[]
In Elegy for the End's description, Rostam names an individual named Roland. While Roland's identity has not been divulged, it may be the Bloodstained Knight's name by process of elimination.
In The Bell's description, it was implied that there was a popular rumor which says that Rostam helped run a secret society that aimed to bring down the Aristocracy, without notifying Arundolyn.
Etymology[]
Rostam was a mythical Persian hero. Among the mythical figure's achievements is slaying an azhdaha; however, there is currently no known link between Genshin Impact's Rostam and Azhdaha.
