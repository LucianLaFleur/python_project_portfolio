Dialogue[]

Moyan: Greetings, guest from afar! If you're looking for Qiaoying Village, just keep walking north on this road.
 You are...
Moyan: I'm Moyan, the village accountant. I sometimes also help the others with odd jobs here and there.
Moyan: Our merchants often pass through here, and I ask after their businesses every day.
Moyan: I also visit every family in the village every month, so I have a good idea of how we're doing financially.
 Sounds really tough...
Moyan: Thank you for asking!
Moyan: My job's not that difficult, especially when compared to taking care of tea trees, drying tea, and stirring them in a hot pan. After all, tea is our most important commodity.
Moyan: The tea farmers get up while it's still dark and work year-round to make sure that people everywhere get to enjoy it at a fair price.
Moyan: I've never heard them complaining about their work, either.
Moyan: They love tea, and they make the most out of their days. That must have rubbed off on me, I guess, 'cause I'm pretty proactive myself.
(If the player has not completed An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade)

 How are things lately?
Moyan: It's a long story...
Moyan: For some reason, the first harvest this year is yellower than usual, and didn't fetch a good price.
Moyan: Most of the villagers live off of the money we make growing tea, so we need to figure out what happened as soon as possible.
(If the player has completed An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade)

 About your income...
Moyan: It's not all stormy clouds. The first harvest wasn't great, but the second was better.
Moyan: When you grow things, you're bound to have a bad year here and there. I just hope next year will be better.
 About Qiaoying Village...
Moyan: We're already within Qiaoying Village's borders. Welcome to the home of Liyue's most famous tea!
Moyan: Qiaoying Village is not as bustling as Yilong Wharf, but a quiter, more relaxed place has value all its own.
Moyan: If you like tea, please give our Sunglo Tea and Single-Origin Yauwan Tea a try, You'll love them!
 Goodbye.
Moyan: Please take care.
