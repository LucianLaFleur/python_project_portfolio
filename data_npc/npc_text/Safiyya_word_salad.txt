Dialogue[]

Safiyya: Hello, please do not touch the plants in the garden. Especially the plants in the laboratory.
 Because they are rare?
Safiyya: I guess it's part of the reason? I'm just a merc guarding this place, so I don't really know much about these plants.
Safiyya: But tragic incidents where researchers lost months or even years of progress have occurred quite a few times here in the past, and they were all because some plants were accidentally damaged.
Safiyya: It sounds really sad, right? I would go mad if all the money I made over the years was lost overnight.
Safiyya: So, when I think of it like that, I pay extra attention to the safety of these plants.
 Got it.
Safiyya: Thank you for your cooperation.
