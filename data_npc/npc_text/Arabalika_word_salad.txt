Arabalika's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Arabalika has a very powerful Ararakalari, as witnessed by the Traveler when he defeated a Ruin Guard by himself. They were sent to Ruins of Dahri to help heal the Varuna Contraption's "branch" in the area and sensing Arapandu's scent on them, Arabalika remained composed. As the roots are underground, The Traveler and Arabalika had to defeat Ruin Guards in the area to go down. He told Paimon to be careful since she does not fight and "mushrooms might eat her," where she added that Aradasha can beat a Ruin Guard in a blink of an eye. Arabalika mentioned that they were indeed powerful in the past, but they are not in the "now," so he has to train harder for his Ararakalari to be stronger. The Traveler and Arabalika fought two activated Ruin Graders shortly after adjusting the "leaves" mechanisms. He then awakens the stone by singing and they returned to the "rest stop" in Apam Woods.[1] Arabalika, alongside Arapandu, Aranakula, and Arakunti, fixed the spore-covered Varuna Contraption once the Traveler got rid of the Fungi in the underground space below Varunastra.[2]

Appearance[]
Arabalika has a light green oval body with a whitish spiral on his chest and two pairs of pointed protrusions on the upper half. He has two smaller green leaves with triangular symbols on his head, with two darker green leaves as a propeller. He holds a brown hooked staff with a white tip in his right hand.

Arabalika: Arama is on an adventure with Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Ararakalari match with Arama, Arabalika wants.
 About Arama...
Arabalika: Big Iron Chunk is no match for Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), and Arama is no match for Vanagni.

Arabalika: Then Arabalika can continue the Ararakalari training, without leaving Vanarana.
 About Ararakalari...

Arabalika: Later, when Arabalika finally beats running mushroom, Aradasha is nowhere to be found.
Arabalika: That's bad. With no Aranara to kick the Big Iron Chunks over, the Big Iron Chunks will stomp their feet and turn Vanarana into a huge mess.
Arabalika: Luckily, the Big Iron Chunks now can't beat Arabalika. It must be blessings from Aradasha.
