Dialogue[]

Nabiya: Temptation triggers love, but too much love triggers disaster...
Nabiya: Luckily, they don't care too much for you.
 Who are "they"...?
Nabiya: Harut and Marut. They're the shadows of nimble demons, free and unfettered creatures...
Nabiya: ...They're also my cats.
 Then "temptation" and "love" are...?
Nabiya: Cats are curious creatures. They have many strengths, but curiosity is not one of them.
Nabiya: Their curiosity and penchant strand fish on the shore and trap birds on the ground...
Nabiya: That means disaster for the fish and birds, no?
 That's a shame.
Nabiya: Perhaps, perhaps not.
