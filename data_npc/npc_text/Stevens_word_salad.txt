He is a researcher specializing in ancient history. After reading a "truly enlightening" document that Iris sent him, he decided to come to the Dragonspine Adventurer Camp believing that the mountain has more to offer than what we see. He even tried to scale the mountain, to no avail.

Dialogue[]

Stevens: *sigh* If only someone could help me out... Oh, sorry, didn't mean to be talking to myself like that.

(If the player loses the match)

Stevens: Thanks for such an enjoyable time. I'm all pumped up now! I'm sure it'll be all smooth sailing for my research from here on out!
(If the player wins the match)

Stevens: I've lost the game and made no progress in my research. Ugh... What should I do!?
 What's the matter?
Stevens: Well, here's how it is: I'm a researcher specializing in ancient history...
Stevens: Thanks to Ms. Iris, I received and read a truly enlightening document recently.
Stevens: She found it here on Dragonspine, and I believe that the mountain must be home to more lost texts...
Stevens: If we had more of them, I would definitely make progress in my research.
Stevens: Never mind weapons or ancient currency, these texts are the true treasure here!
 Have you gained anything from your trip so far?
Stevens: Ugh, don't get me started. Iris is far too busy, so I've had to scale the mountain myself...  Almost lost my life in the process, never mind finding any ancient texts.
Stevens: But wouldn't say that I gained nothing from all this. I did find some other things, such as this crown.
Stevens: My guess is that this was left behind by those who once wanted to conquer Dragonspine, One can only wonder as to the trials and tribulations they must have encountered.
Stevens: ...I fear we can only discover a few things about the past through these relics...
Stevens: Ugh sorry, I'm rambling... I've already gleaned all I could from this item. From the looks of you, you must be an adventurer, so why don't you take this with you?
Stevens: Don't stand on ceremony — it's no use to me anyway, and what's more, I may require your assistance in the future, too.
(Obtain 4★  Broken Rime's Echo)
 Well, I'll leave you to it.
Stevens: Goodbye. Be careful, this is an uncannily perilous place.
