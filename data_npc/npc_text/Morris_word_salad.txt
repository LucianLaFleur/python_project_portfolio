Profile[]
Morris came from an aristocratic family in Fontaine. Morris eventually fell in love with a maid named Elisa and eventually got her pregnant. He tried to keep this relationship a secret as revealing it would strip him of his status and inheritance, and thus sent her away with a large amount of Mora while ordering her to terminate the pregnancy.
Elisa would eventually give birth to two children and sent a letter and photo to Morris sometime afterwards. At the same time, Morris entered a relationship with another woman, and fearing the damage that would be caused if the photo was leaked, hired an assassin from Fleuve Cendre to assassinate her. The assassin successfully killed Elisa, but not her two children, Baptiste and Veronique, who she had saved by hiding them underneath the floor when the assassin came. The two would be traumatized by the event and swear revenge for her death.
During the Roses and Muskets event, Morris invested in Xavier's film but stripped him of the funding once hearing that Xavier wanted to recreate "The Two Musketeers" stating the reason was financial issues. He had hoped that with no expenses, the film's production would be ground to a halt. Unfortunately, the plan was dashed when Xavier manages to get a crew to produce the film at little cost, thus forcing him to attempt to sabotage production by dumping the film in the sewers. At the same time, the assassin he had hired was killed by the now-grown Baptiste and Veronique, who were trying to reach him. The murder would be noted by the Maison Gardiennage, particularly Chevreuse, who managed to learn of the true mastermind after confronting Baptiste in his house.
Chevreuse proceeded to concoct a plan to expose the culprit following the information given to her by Baptiste; looking through the records about their past, she is able to pinpoint Morris as the true mastermind, having Yoimiya assist her in nabbing him. After "celebrating" with the others on the film's success, Yoimiya drags Morris with her to collect fireworks, only to be "shot" and killed by her. Morris, unaware of Chevreuse's identity, panics at her apparent death and confesses to having Elisa killed in a pitiful attempt to save his life. Rather than killing him, Chevreuse decides to arrest him, enraging Veronique, who was in the room and attempts to kill him, but Chevreuse blocks her shot. As the two are taken into custody, Chevreuse decides to give Wriothesley a "heads-up" about their arrival; though he does not accept or deny it, he does agree to give everyone a copy of The Steambird once the case was published to ensure that Morris would be seen as a villain and not live a comfortable life in the prison.
