Dialogue[]

Najat: Let me see... As for the stuff we put in storage today... Yup, the numbers are correct.
 Hey. Are you...
Najat: Ah, sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to ignore you — I was just doing a mental tally of some goods.
Najat: This is where we store necessities for the rest of the village. We have to check the number of goods here every day to ensure that nothing is missing.
Najat: Not to worry, though. Habachi may be a little strict, but we do not simply grill everyone who passes by for no good reason.
 Seems like this warehouse is a big deal.
Najat: That's right. Everyone can see that as well, so there's no real point intentionally hiding it.
Najat: If the village were ever to be in peril, we will immediately stop the White Lift, cut the suspension bridge, and defend the warehouse at all costs.
 Well, see you around.
Najat: ...Eh? Ah, right, see you!
