Chuyi's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Chuyi appears as a silhouette in Tartaglia's Character Tale, Childe: Sigil of Permission, set shortly before the Liyue Archon Quests. As Chuyi discusses the Teahouse's finances with its owner, Tartaglia and Javert confront them about the owner's debt to the Northland Bank. Tartaglia easily defeats the guards and discovers a Sigil of Permission in the owner's possession, which he takes for the Fatui's use.
After ransacking the Teahouse, Tartaglia exposed the owner's accounting fraud and got him arrested. After the events of the Liyue Archon Quests, Yelan takes over Yanshang Teahouse as her base of operations.[4] With Yelan's change in the Teahouse's policies, Chuyi's attitude towards the Traveler makes a similar change.

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Farewell, Archaic Lord.


Chuyi: This is the Yanshang Teahouse.
Chuyi: Now that you're here, are you mentally prepared? Did you bring enough money?
 It sounds like the tea here must be quite expensive.
Chuyi: Who said that a teahouse must only sell tea?
Chuyi: Someone stupid like you shouldn't be out making a mess of our city. Your time would be better spent listening to an opera or sitting in a restaurant.
Chuyi: There're some places you don't belong, and you're most certainly not needed around here.
Chuyi: If you don't leave, I will have to ask security to "escort" you out.
 No, thank you. Goodbye.
Chuyi: Oh, so you do have some manners...
Chuyi: I'll return the courtesy by not calling our security. Good day.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Farewell, Archaic Lord.


Chuyi: This is the Yanshang Teahouse.
Chuyi: The new owner says that all who approach are guests, so you might as well head up for some tea.
 You're under new ownership?
Chuyi: The previous owner sold this property due to debt problems.
Chuyi: The new owner made some adjustments to how we operate after taking over...
Chuyi: ...But not that you'd understand, anyway. Just treat this place like any other "teahouse." Heh.
 Not going to "escort" me away?
Chuyi: No idea what you're talking about. Of course not.
Chuyi: Our new owner also hopes that more people will come to drink tea... As long as they behave, drink tea, and chat, they are welcome here.
