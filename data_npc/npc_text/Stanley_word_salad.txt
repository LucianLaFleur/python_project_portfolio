Profile[]
Stanley is allegedly an amazing adventurer who made it all the way to the scalding, windless Mare Jivari. He tells many long stories about himself to the people in Mondstadt, particularly Jack. However, his tendency to call himself "Stanley" in third person strikes people as odd.
It turns out that "Stanley" is not, in fact, the real Stanley. His real name is Hans Archibald, a companion of Stanley's during their trip to Mare Jivari. To save Hans' life, Stanley sacrificed his own — an act that haunts the man to this day. Desperate to keep the memory of Stanley alive, Hans took up Stanley's name and started spreading stories of him as if they were his own.
At the end of "Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land," Venti frees the real Stanley's spirit, releasing Hans from his emotional burden. Since then Hans only vaguely remembers the events of that day, but has become significantly more relaxed.

Appearance[]
Hans has short copper hair, a beard and a moustache. He wears the standard male uniform of the Adventurers' Guild. The uniform consists of two layers of shirt (a long-sleeve white shirt with mandarin collar and a green laced up vest), green vambraces, a red necktie, a green cape collar with a ruffled trim and a triangular back flap, a buckled belt, knee-length green pants with red accents, brown stockings and laced leather shoes. The Adventurers' Guild logo, an eight-pointed star, is printed on the right and back flaps of the collar.

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Daytime, before completing Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land)
Stanley: I'm Stanley. Remember my name. You're also here for my stories, aren't you?
 Who are you?
Stanley: Stanley! It's Stanley! Some adventurer you must be if you don't even know my name!
Stanley: I'm a living legend among adventurers! The man who waded through the Mare Jivari and Geyser Realm!
Stanley: I have enough stories to tell for three days straight...
 The Mare Jivari?
Stanley: Sharp! That's the best out  of all my legendary stories.
Stanley: On the other side of this continent, there's a barren domain where nothing grows.
Stanley: A sea of ashes, with nothing but silence that will make your ears ring...
Stanley: ...*goes on and on*
Stanley: ...And the monster created a vortex in the Mare Jivari, so I held tightly onto my friend's hand...
Stanley: ...*goes on and on*
Stanley: ...Sadly, I was the only one who returned home to Mondstadt with tears in my eyes...
Stanley: Are you guys falling asleep!?
Stanley: Wake up! You!
 Sorry for bothering you.
Stanley: Wait, you're leaving? I'm not even halfway done!

(Nighttime, before completing Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land)
Stanley: Stanley... Stanley... Your name shall never be forgotten...
 About Stormterror...
(After completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
Stanley: If only that fellow Stanley were here now...
Stanley: I mean, Stanley's, uh, companion.
Stanley: Indeed! If that fellow were also here, we would be enough to take Stormterror on, just the two of us!
Stanley: I really miss him. If only he were still with us...
 Why are you repeating your own name?
Stanley: Oh, you heard that? Ah, it's nothing.
Stanley: I'm simply lamenting the past, lamenting a friend that has passed...
Stanley: That's exactly what I'm doing, why should I lie about it?
 Sorry for bothering you.
Stanley: Please, leave me. I need to be alone.

Dialogue Set #2[]

(Daytime, after completing Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land)
Stanley: Want to hear the tale of yours truly, the great adventurer Stanley?
Stanley: Oh? It's you.
 You're still calling yourself Stanley.
Stanley: So you already know about the fact that Stanley was actually my friend. You must have heard the truth at the bottom of my bottle, I suppose.
Stanley: ...I do remember that I did meet you — and someone else to boot — while drunk one day...
Stanley: Hmm, I can't quite remember why, but I've felt much more relaxed ever since then.
Stanley: I only call myself Stanley today in order to ensure that his tales will remain on everyone's lips.
Stanley: Haha, I imagine that if this were me from before, being exposed like this would have frustrated me for sure...
 Let's hear a tale then.
Stanley: Haha, so you'd like to hear some more? Well then, I'll make this an occasion, and tell you the real version.
Stanley: On the other side of this continent, there's a barren domain where nothing grows.
Stanley: A sea of ashes, with nothing but silence that will make your ears ring...
Stanley: ...*goes on and on*
Stanley: ...the monster created a vortex in the Ashen Sea, and I would have been sucked into it, if Stanley had not held tightly onto my hand.
Stanley: ...*goes on and on*
Stanley: Sadly, I was the only one who returned home to Mondstadt with tears in my eyes...
Stanley: Hey. Hey! Are you falling asleep? Wake up!
 See you.
Stanley: Bye. I trust that you will not forget Stanley's tale.

(Nighttime, after completing Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land)
Stanley: *sigh* What I would give to have another mug with you, Stanley...
 Are you feeling alright?
Stanley: Ah, I... I'm fine, don't worry.
Stanley: I just get sentimental sometimes on nights like this, as I listen to the din in the tavern.
Stanley: It brings me back to the days when I and Stanley had just started adventuring together. We'd always drink ourselves under the table the night before setting out.
Stanley: *sigh* It's alright. I'll get up. For his sake, I definitely will.
 Sorry for bothering you, then.
Stanley: No problem. I just need to be alone for a while...
