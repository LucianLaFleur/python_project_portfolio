Sasayuri (Japanese: 笹百合 Sasayuri) was a cherished tengu general from Inazuma who served the Raiden Shogun and was known as the Great Tengu of Yougou.[1] Sasayuri was killed during a civil war between the Shogun and the people of the Great Serpent Orobashi from Watatsumi Island.[2]
Sasayuri is depicted alongside the Raiden Shogun, Mikoshi Chiyo, and the Kitsune Saiguu in Character Teaser - "Raiden Shogun: Nightmare." Of them, Sasayuri is the first to disappear from the picnic ground after Raiden recollects the battle against Orobashi.

Story[]
The exact circumstances of Sasayuri's death are unknown. Before the invasion of Yashiori Island, Akuou — the champion of Watatsumi Island — made a bet with Mouun that he would duel Sasayuri over Tenshukaku.[3] While the duel over Tenshukaku never occurred, they indeed battled on Yashiori Island, during which Sasayuri's tengu mask "shattered."[1]
After Sasayuri's death, the position of Great Tengu of Yougou eventually changed hands to Reizenbou,[4] although it is unknown whether the title changed hands between them.
