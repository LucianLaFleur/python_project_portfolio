Dialogue[]

Zhihua: Madam Qiming, this time I should like for you to read my fortune on the matter of... my love life.
Qiming: Love life... again? This must be the tenth time this month...
Zhihua: I only keep coming because your predictions are so accurate! Especially that one thing that you keep telling me, "Being preoccupied with the outcome of a divination is not conducive to finding true love."
Zhihua: That's why from now on, my focus will be solely on the divination itself, not the outcome.
Qiming: I see. Well, let me try to explain this differently...
Qiming: True love may be impossibly far away, or it may be right under your nose. You cannot force it. But when its day comes, it will reveal itself to you right before your very eyes... and who knows, maybe today will be that day.
Zhihua: Aha! I understand. I understand it now!
Qiming: Pray tell what you presume to have understood...
Zhihua: You DO feel the same way! From this day forth I will live solely to bring you happiness. Will you marry me!?
Qiming: ...No thank you.
Zhihua: Well, are you free tonight?
Qiming: No. And now I'm calling the guards.

Trivia[]
As to his name, each of its characters per se has positive meanings: "will, determination, and ambition" (Chinese: 志 zhì) and "splendor, brilliance, fame, and beauty" (Chinese: 华 huá). However, the combination of these characters may imply he is merely seeking vanity,[2] and it is the opposite of the Confucian virtue zhixue (Chinese: 志学 zhìxué, "to devote oneself to the pursuit of learning"). Note that the name of Qiming, a fortune-teller on whom he has a crush, likely means "beautiful destiny".
He shares his English VA Alejandro Saab with Cyno.
