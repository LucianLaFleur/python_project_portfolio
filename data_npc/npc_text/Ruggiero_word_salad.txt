Profile[]
Ruggiero was on a quest to obtain proof of the Grand Symphonies' existance and collected special conches to do so. He sensed a mysterious energy lingering in Petrichor, which was at that time a run-down fishing village, and went there to find the Faded Castle of legend, where he believed he would find his answers. [3]
In Petrichor, Ruggiero met the Golden Hunter. The Golden Hunter's extensive knowledge about Remuria, which contradicted commonly accepted historical knowledge at the time, caused Ruggiero to suspect that he was actually one of the last remnants of Remuria, but he didn't understand how he became immortal.[4] Ruggiero helped the Golden Hunter to prevent Boethius from awakening the seals to Remuria, and eventually helped sealed off the Faded Castle as well after being unable to find the relics he was looking for there.[5]
Eventually, Ruggiero learned the truth behind the Grand Symphonies and their capabilities. He gave up on his quest, believing that "humanity has no need to — nor should they — control any knowledge beyond their abilities." The Golden Hunter left, but Ruggiero decided to stay behind and rebuild Petrichor. By attracting refugees to live there and spreading other versions of the legend, the recently rebuilt seals and the secrets of the town would be protected. He founded the Consilium Sapientium, a council of elders who would assess all the affairs in Petrichor,[2]  and had monetary help from Juliano, a wealthy adventurer, to rebuild the town.[6]
Bravais believed that due to the poor academic environment in Fontaine then, his accomplishments never received fair evaluation.[3]
