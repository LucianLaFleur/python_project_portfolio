Dialogue[]

Izem: Today's coffee... is the same as yesterday's.
 Are you alright?
Izem: It's not bad. Or as what the people here might say, it's pretty good.
Izem: Everyone loves peace and quiet. Although I'm not really used to it, there's nothing to complain about.
Izem: Drinking coffee every day, lazing about, passing each day slowly... I feel like my days are longer than when I was in the Corps of Thirty.
Izem: The acting manager makes me the same coffee every day, and says I should be as used to peace as the nearby residents are.
Izem: A day like that will probably come in the future.
 It's actually a good thing to retire.
Izem: Yeah, I've come to realize that lately.
Izem: Maybe it's time to say goodbye to my old chaotic lifestyle.
(Obtain  Old Merc's Pal)
 See you.
Izem: Yes. Farewell, my previous life.
