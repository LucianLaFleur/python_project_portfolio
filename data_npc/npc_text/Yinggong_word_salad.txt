Dialogue[]
Before Backstage Helpers[]

Yinggong: So, are you guys ready?
 Yes.
Yinggong: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you — Homeward, Bravebeard!
 I'm not ready yet.
Yinggong: Don't worry. It's only natural to be a bit nervous.

After Backstage Helpers[]

Yinggong: Back so soon after the performance? Maybe you want to give it another go?
 I want to see it again.
Yinggong: Haha, it seems you really enjoy this. Let's do an extra performance then.
 About the Yun-Han Opera Troupe...
Yinggong: No special performance has been planned for this year's Lantern Rite. After all, we've already performed for many years' Lantern Rite in succession. So this year, we can finally have a good rest.
Yinggong: That said, I started getting a little restless and decided to put on a paper play for the kids, haha.
 See you.
Yinggong: Goodbye for now. When we meet again, I shall show you the costumes and props I've made.
