Dialogue[]

Afshin: I've got some fine goods and intriguing stories for my guests, if you're interested.
 Let's see it.
Afshin: It is hard to tell the true value of goods by just looking at them... So, this is all I can show you.
(Opens the Shop menu)
 Let's hear it.
Afshin: The flower stands proudly on the top of the hills in Liyue, fluttering in the chilly wind up high. It's every bit as pale as the hair of the goddess who touched it...
Afshin: Extraordinary as it is, it sells for only 80,000 Mora.
Afshin: A jar of wine outlasting the years that was graced by the Anemo God's humming. Drink it, and you can chant melodious poems...
Afshin: Stupendous as it is, it sells for only 200,000 Mora.
 It sounds familiar, yet slightly different...
Afshin: It sounds like you don't believe me...
Afshin: Why don't you take this and contemplate?
Afshin: No matter, it is but a souvenir from my extensive collection.
(Obtain  Naku Weed ×4)
 I'd better get going.
Afshin: That's a shame.
