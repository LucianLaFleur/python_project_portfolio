Idle Quotes[]

 Jewelry from Liyue...
Media:VO Shiliu 01.ogg "Jewels from Liyue, come take a look!"

Dialogue[]

Shiliu: Why won't anything sell...
 What do you sell here?
Shiliu: Take a look and you'll see! Top-quality goods at low, low prices, all direct from Liyue.

 What won't sell?
Shiliu: Jewelry. Even though I brought all of this personally from Mingxing Jewelry in Liyue Harbor. They're the best of the best, I mean, just look at these!
Shiliu: ...You dress funny, are you a traveler? Fair enough... I guess now you're going to tell me that these are no use to you on your travels anyway. Right?
Shiliu: *sigh* ...I totally misjudged this one. I thought I could increase sales by moving into Mondstadt...
Shiliu: Little did I know, people here would sooner spend every last Mora to their name at the tavern than take a look at what I'm selling...
Shiliu: Maybe they just can't afford it? Hmm... I suppose not everywhere is as affluent as Liyue...
 Tell me about Liyue.
Shiliu: Ah, so you want to know about my hometown?
Shiliu: Liyue has the busiest commercial port in all of Teyvat. There's merchants from all over the world there. Hehe, growing up in a place like that, I knew I wanted to go into business from a very young age.
Shiliu: Have you heard of Lord Morax? The god who watches over Liyue?
Shiliu: At the very least, you should know that the Mora you have there is named after him!
Shiliu: Ah, I haven't been back in a long time. Maybe the reason I can't make any money is because I'm too far away from Lord Morax?
 Goodbye.
Shiliu: Surprise, surprise. Another no-sale!

Trivia[]
She is one of the few characters from Liyue to refer to the Geo Archon as Morax instead of Rex Lapis,  outside the context of his connection to Mora. The others are Wanyan and Keqing, who primarily calls him Rex Lapis, but is quoted as questioning if Morax knows everything in her Character Stories. Unlike them, Shiliu calls him Lord Morax.
