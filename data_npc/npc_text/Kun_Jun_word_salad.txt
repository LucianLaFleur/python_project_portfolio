If you are the memory of the earth... then I am the memory of coexistence... of coexistence with humanity.—Kun Jun (as Azhdaha) to Jiu (as Azhdaha)
Kun Jun comes from a family of famous artisans.[6] While Azhdaha is in control of his body, Kun Jun possesses the ability to read the memories of ores, noting, however, that these memories erode over time and that certain stones retain clearer memories than others. Azhdaha in Kun Jun's body was driven to search for Dragonfall, a rare elemental ore that was almost entirely mined out centuries ago.
When the Traveler and Zhongli reach the Dragon-Queller Tree, Kun Jun finally remembers that he is part of the spirit of Azhdaha temporarily possessing this human body. Kun Jun helps the Traveler and Zhongli defeat Jiu, the other part of Azhdaha in the domain Beneath the Dragon-Queller.
Kun Jun describes himself and Jiu as akin to the "yin and yang" of Azhdaha's spirit. Moreover, Kun Jun recalls his eternal friendship with Morax, how they worked together in the past, and tells Zhongli that he will always be Morax to him.
Before he leaves Kun Jun's body, Azhdaha predicts that the real Kun Jun will return to Liyue and surely become a famous craftsman in time, like his family before him.[7] The real Kun Jun is heavily implied to be the blacksmith whom Xiangling met while looking for something to give to Xinyan as a birthday gift. She describes him as someone who wore glasses and fell ill for a period of time, during which he felt disoriented and as though his body was not his own. After making a sudden recovery, he gained the uncanny ability to instinctively distinguish stones with ore inside from those which didn't. Xiangling used the jade he picked out to craft a pendant for Xinyan's instrument.[8]

Appearance[]

Trivia[]
Kun Jun could be related to the legendary blacksmith Kunwu, who forged weapons such as Dragon's Bane, Lion's Roar, and Solar Pearl. They are the only two characters so far with the surname Kun (Chinese: 昆 Kūn).
Kun Jun shares the same Chinese and Japanese voice actors as Azhdaha.
