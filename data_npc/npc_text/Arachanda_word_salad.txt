(Talk to Arachanda)
Arachanda: Impressive Nara, let's "have a competition?" But not with Arachanda, it's a competition with what Arachanda has prepared...
 Okay, I got this!
Arachanda: Arachanda is gonna see what Nara can do. Nara should remember to break the stone piles first, and then the chests!
 I have something else to do.
Arachanda: Okay. There are other important matters.

Arachanda: Aw... What a pity! Dear Nara friend, you got the order wrong, need to do the challenge again.
