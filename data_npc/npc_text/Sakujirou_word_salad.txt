Sakujirou is originally from Inazuma, but left due to it being too peaceful, and him wanting to see the outside world. He then snuck back in after the Sakoku Decree took effect, due to him regretting his decision and wanting to make up for past mistakes. This caused him to be chased by the Tenryou Commission, having to take refuge in Naganohara Fireworks until safe for him to leave. He used to be childhood friends with Imatani Keisuke, until they had a fight and stopped talking.
