Yong'an: Hello tra—a—achoo!
Yong'an: Sorry... Can I help?
 Are you alright?
Yong'an: I'm fine, thanks for your concern... achoo!

 Who's Butch?
Yong'an: Butch is the fiercest and strongest of all the cats here. The ginger one, and it's a she by the way.
Yong'an: I have names for all the cats here. Look, that's Jen-Jen, and there's Ogre Face and Cinnamon Bun...
Yong'an: They come over when I call them now... Achoo!
 About the cats...
Yong'an: Come to think of it, I saw a girl trying to give them some milk while I was on morning patrol...ACHOO!
Yong'an: Thank goodness I was able to stop her. Well, not that she meant them any ill, but cats will get upset stomachs from drinking milk!
Yong'an: ...Maybe it's because I've been around cats for so long, but I've also stopped liking milk myself. Here, you take them...ACHOO!
(Obtain  Milk ×5)
 You sure this is nothing serious?
Yong'an: Yes; I'm fine, I'm fine... Just a little bit allergic. It's only a... phew... little hai—hai—hairs, I can ha—a—andle it... ACHOO!
 Seen anyone around who looks a fair bit like me?
Yong'an: Ahhchoo! ...I've been patrolling the wharf the whole time, but I can't say I've seen anyone who looks like you.
Yong'an: *sigh* But I could always have missed something...
Yong'an: After sticking with the cats for too long, I've gotten bad at remembering faces. I even mistook our sergeant for some old fellow asking for directions...
Yong'an: Ah... Ah... I will keep a look out when I'm on patrol in future. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevACHOO!
 Goodbye.
Yong'an: Have a nice trACHOO! Trip.
