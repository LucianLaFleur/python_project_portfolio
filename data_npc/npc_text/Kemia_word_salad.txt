Dialogue[]

Kemia: So many resumes are sent in every day only for me to find none that can be used. What's the point?
 You mean...
Kemia: The Akademiya welcomes talent from all walks of life. After all, the talented are best known by the want of them.
Kemia: But some co-workers of mine are rash to recommend everyone. My desk is now inundated with piles of resumes.
Kemia: With all due respect, most of them... are just garbage.
Kemia: The more imbeciles we take in, the more stupid things we'll have to deal with every day. It threatens our efficiency. I don't know what's on their mind.
 Not even one can be used?
Kemia: I'm not saying that there's not a single capable candidate, but it's so rare.
Kemia: As for students who graduated from the Akademiya, they may not have working experience, but they have developed good research habits and attitude in years of study.
Kemia: We should give our own students more chances instead of recruiting untrustworthy outsiders with fake reputations.
 See you.
Kemia: Goodbye, I hope there will be more true talent coming to the Akademiya.
