Profile[]
Thelxie is a mechanical penguin built by Freminet for a commission from Zuria Destree as a means to help her son, Lescot Destree, with his Loneliness Syndrome. As the story progresses, it is revealed that Lescot already passed away and the one who truly needs Thelxie's help is Zuria, who has come down with the same illness after the death of her son. She commissioned Thelxie as part of her guidance therapy, which she proposed to her family doctor Jalacan to help with the illness.
Thelxie is named after a Water Imp from a local fairytale. Thelxie speaks in Morse code as Freminet has not yet installed a language module. Thelxie's responses are prewritten and picks up some keywords.
