Fouad: Hello, Traveler.
 You know me?
Fouad: Ah, I see I guessed correctly.
Fouad: The boss told us what you look like. He said you're our new buddy.
Fouad: You have pretty distinct traits, so I recognized you right away.
Fouad: Well, since the boss says so, guess that makes you a friend of ours now. The Eremites bid you welcome.
 Well, see you.
Fouad: Take it easy now!
