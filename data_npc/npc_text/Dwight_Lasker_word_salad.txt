Profile[]
Dwight was born before the cataclysm 500 years ago and was sent to the Narzissenkreuz Institute during his childhood, where he became friends with Basil, Emanuel, and Karl.[2][3]
At some point, Dwight became the director of the Institute of Natural Philosophy, a position he held until middle age.[Note 2] He recruited numerous child prodigies as researchers at the Institute. It is known that Coppelius worked at his Institute when he was a child. Dwight mentioned "Ever since he was a child, he's always been incredibly talented."[1]
During the cataclysm, Dwight closed the Institute for the safety of its members. He wanted to prevent the young ones to go out and engage in battle. Dwight believed that it was crucial to prioritize post-disaster reconstruction rather than sending people to die.[1]
After the cataclysm, Fontaine experienced "the first flood period,"[4] during which most of the buildings would gradually be submerged. Dwight had selected a good piece of land near the Fountain of Lucine as the new location for the Institute of Natural Philosophy. However, he was informed that the area would be replaced by the Opera Epiclese. Dwight felt dissatisfied with this decision and criticizing "They'd sooner set faces aflame with shame and laughter! To think that anyone could be so comical..."[1]
Later on, Dwight and others paid their respects at Basil's grave. Emanuel Guillotin introduced his adopted son, Alain Guillotin, to Dwight, seeking Institute support for Alain. Dwight later met with the newly appointed Iudex (likely Neuvillette) and believed that he was "much more reliable than Leon and those other clowns."[1]
Alain's research and breakthroughs in clockwork meka caught Dwight's attention. Later, Alain achieved satisfactory results in the early phases of his research on Khaenri'ah war machines and Primal Constructs energy. Impressed by Alain's progress, Dwight increased the Institute's investment in his work. Additionally, Dwight took notice of Alain's research assistant, Carter Scherbius, frequently taking leaves of absence.[1]
Afterwards, Alain introduced Rene de Petrichor and Jakob Ingold to Dwight. After some consideration, Dwight accepted them and arranged for them to work in Alain's lab.[1] However, this decision caused discontent among other researchers.[5]
Dwight visited Carter while he was unconscious and collected his blood samples in an attempt to find a cure or a way to mitigate his illness. Meanwhile, Rene learned about Carter's condition. He decided to separate himself and Jakob from Alain's project.[6] Rene approached Dwight with a request for an independent research project related to the Abyss, which included studying Durin's blood, Elynas' remains, and the Dark Mud from Liyue.[7] Dwight believed that the proposed research plan held significant practical value in addressing the toxins contaminating Fontaine's soil and water due to Elynas. Consequently, he decided to approve it. At the same time, Dwight discovered that Rene and Jakob were the adopted sons of his childhood friend, Karl Ingold.[1]
Soon after, Alain achieved a remarkable feat by successfully inventing Arkhe energy systems, also known as "Pneumousia Energy."[8] Dwight recognized this accomplishment as the biggest breakthrough in a century and believed that it had the potential to revolutionize society in its entirety.[1]
Dwight received a report regarding the Narzissenkreuz Ordo and their leader, referred to as the "Master."[9] He entrusted the investigation of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo to Emanuel Guillotin, a former Marechaussee Hunter and his childhood friend.[1]
The whereabouts of Dwight are currently unknown. In present day, the Traveler found the key to Dwight's office inside a chest within The Narzissenkreuz Ordo and discovered several rifthounds in his office.

Notes[]

↑ Dwight's full name can be deduced between Forgotten Vessel and Veteran's Visage's descriptions.

↑ The director's age is presumed to be similar to that of Basil and the other friends. This inference is based on details found in stories such as the Heroes' Tea Party and Basil's quotes, which indicate that they are no longer young.
