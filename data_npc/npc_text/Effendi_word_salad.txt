Dialogue[]

(Reputation Level 1–2)
Effendi: Greetings, welcome to the Citadel of Regzar. Would you be interested in taking on some commissions?
(Reputation Level 3–6)
Effendi: It's been a while. Are you here again today for the Residents' Commissions?
(Reputation Level 7–10)
Effendi: You're here! Welcome! How have you been? All good? I've got some new commissions here. It'll be great if you'd be willing to help.
 How's my reputation in Sumeru City?
(Reputation Level 1-2)
Effendi: If you're willing to help complete some commissions, I can pay you.
(Reputation Level 3-6)
Effendi: On behalf of the Akademiya, I thank you for your contribution to Sumeru City.
(Reputation Level 7-10)
Effendi: Everyone speaks highly of your work, and even the most taciturn grizzled mercenary nodded in agreement. I hope you work with us for a long time.

 Tell me about yourself...
Effendi: I am the liaison officer sent by the Akademiya to the Citadel of Regzar.
Effendi: The Citadel of Regzar is the gathering place of the Corps of Thirty. Many of the Eremites come and go every day.
Effendi: But I mainly communicate with the Parchamdar and the logistics officer.
Effendi: The Parchamdar used to be a researcher, and the logistics officer is friendly too. Overall, everyone is communicative and it's made my job much easier.
Effendi: But the people of the Corps of Thirty are still too occupied by the commissions from the Akademiya, so I will post part of the commissions to the public.
Effendi: The logistics officer, Yunus, is also greatly in favor of this practice, and is willing to allocate a portion of their military supplies as payment.
 See you.
Effendi: Farewell.
