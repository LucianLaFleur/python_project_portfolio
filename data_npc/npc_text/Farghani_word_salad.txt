 Teyvat...

During A Parade of Providence

 Star course deviations...
Media:VO Farghani A Parade of Providence 01.ogg "Could deviations in the star's course have affected my calculations?"

Dialogue[]

Farghani: Why is discrepancy always inevitable at this point of calculation...?
 What are you calculating?
Farghani: Before I answer your question, let me ask you one: What do you think Teyvat is like?
Farghani: You don't have to respond, just think.
Farghani: I have a revolutionary idea... If Teyvat was round, that would explain a lot of things.
Farghani: Why are there currents in oceans? Why would the sun and moon alternate rising? Why would there be changes in temperature?
Farghani: All that could be explained with the round-earth theory!
 So what's the discrepancy?
Farghani: *sigh* That there's the rub.
Farghani: My theory is perfect, but the calculation of land surface doesn't bear that out...
Farghani: Damn it, I shouldn't have ditched math classes in school! It's all Vikram's fault!
 Why blame him?
Farghani: That's because he asked me to skip classes with him. Whenever there was a class he found boring, he would grab me and have coffee in the downtown area.
Farghani: But that guy did surprisingly well in all the foundation courses. I suspect that he dragged me out of classes on purpose, while he studied by himself at night.
Farghani: Ah, time passes so quickly. I didn't expect him to be a candidate for the next Grand Conservator now.
Farghani: I hope he gets elected so I can go around telling everyone that I skipped classes with the Grand Conservator back in the day.
 See you.
Farghani: Where did it go wrong...?

Event Dialogue[]
A Parade of Providence[]

Farghani: Star... star course deviations...
Farghani: Ah, if I continue my studies down this path, I might just be able to see why there is a separation between my theories and the calculations.
Farghani: The Interdarshan Championships have done a lot of good this time. If Rtawahist hadn't selected Miss Layla as the representative, I would have never consulted her research.
Farghani: I can only say that Miss Layla keeps too low a profile. Such incredible research needs to be seen by more people.

Trivia[]
Farghani is named after the Persian astronomer Al-Farghani (Arabic: أبو العبّاس أحمد بن محمد بن كثير الفرغاني Abū al-ʿAbbās Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Kathīr al-Farghānī), also known as Alfraganus in the West, who formulated a more accurate figure for the size of the Earth. Farghani's talks of a "discrepancy" appears to be a nod to Christopher Columbus' incorrect estimate of the size of the Earth being based on interpreting Al-Farghani's figures as being in Roman rather than Arabic miles.
