Media:VO Staelle 01.ogg "Just then, the rain stopped. Or, should it keep raining? Hmm..."

Dialogue[]

Staelle: She smiled, her lovely face wet with rain, and she felt herself fortunate indeed.
Staelle: For this way, he would not know that she was crying...
 What are you talking about?
Staelle: Hmm? I'm considering the plot for a novel. The editor's been on my case for two days now — I shan't be able to delay any longer.

Staelle: *sigh* The vagaries of writing serial novels...
Staelle: I originally took this up as relief from boredom. I never expected the romance novel I wrote to be so popular.
Staelle: I was quite naive at the time, signing that serialization contract as I did. And now, I find myself struggling late into the nights over my writing progress...
Staelle: *sigh* I'm stopping once I finish this series. I mean, it's not as if I need the Mora...
 See you.
Staelle: "See you later," she said to him...
Staelle: Knowing in her heart that this would not likely be the case.
