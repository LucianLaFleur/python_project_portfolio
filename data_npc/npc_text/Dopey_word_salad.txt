Feline Fortress Furrdyssey[]

(Talk to Fischl after reaching Trusted with Dopey)
Fischl: Ohoho! So this is the rumored sacred land that people name the Furball Fortress! And yet it is furnished in such a prosaic manner — shabby, one might even call it.
Fischl: Surely a few... swings woven from the vines of purple agate grapes might be built! Pure silver lamps mounted with candles made of abyssal sea salt, all the better to light the cat-feeding platters with the motifs of nightborne stars!
Fischl: And... Yes, statues! Forged in the image of cat familiars by melting the venerable coinage of lost dynasties and adorning them with strange pearls and dewdrops from the depths of a fjord. Surely, this would make for an amenable choice!
Fischl: You surely must agree, do you not, dear familiar...
Fischl: ...Hmm. You have yet to declare your name to your Prinzessin. Think on that, then, and know that it shall be your utmost honor to be known to her!
Dopey: Meow?
Paimon: His name is "Dopey," esteemed Prinzessin!
Paimon: Dopey isn't the brightest, and he can't really understand or appreciate your exquisite choice of words. Please, show him clemency, Prinzessin...
Paimon: Hey, wait, no, that's not right! Why does Paimon get like this whenever she sees Fischl?
 Nothing wrong with that, let me give it a whirl too!
 I, the Great Cat Conjuror, sincerely pay my humble respects!
Fischl: Haha, as I anticipated! Cat Conjurors, thou hath once more been brought before our august person by the weavings of the threads of fate...
Fischl: 'Tis a most pleasing reunion!
Paimon: What a title... Looks like Fischl heard about us from Valerina!
Fischl: By your counsel, much thought have I given of late within Immernachtreich to realize the ingenuities obtained from prior experiences, and...
Fischl: I have decided to select the most sagacious and sensible of cat familiars to accompany my eminent person on my sojourns!
Dopey: Meow~
Paimon: Oh, so you were also planning on taking care of a cat, Fischl? Well, understandable. Most people want to have their own after seeing just so how adorable they are!
Paimon: But Fischl, don't you already have Oz?
Paimon: And the two of you tend to move really fast, can a cat keep up? Or... Are you gonna have Oz fly while carrying the cat?
Fischl: Hmph! I, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, often traverse three thousand universes. Though such a journey may not be long, having more suitable companions and gaining insight into things easily overlooked... naturally wouldn't hurt.
Fischl: Oz also would like to have a cat familiar to play... *cough* Ahem, to join forces with to guarantee that my mood shall shine bright as moonlight every second of every day!
Fischl: Yet, 'tis a shame that though Oz went to great pains to don a form that sets most at ease, he could not diminish his majesty fully, and could not approach the cat familiars.
Fischl: Whenever dear Oz gets within five paces of a cat familiar, their fur shall inadvertently stand on end and inflate like a Bloatty Floatty unmoored. Any closer, and terror overtakes them, and they flee for the hills.
Fischl: The Anemo Archon's devoted and loyal nuns recommended that Oz repose without, and as their advice was sound, I graciously assented.
Paimon: Majesty? Oh, right, Paimon gets it...
Paimon: You mean that Oz's body has so much Electro energy that the second he enters the Furball Fortress, all the feline fur gets electri-fried, right?
Paimon: But if that's true, then how could a cat ever travel with you, Fischl...?
Paimon: If only there was some material in Teyvat that could block the effects of Electro!
Paimon: Then we could make cat clothes out of that material, and then a cat could travel with you and Oz, no problem!
Dopey: Meow?
 Gimme! Give it to me first!
 Those Electro Slimes will be no match once I have donned this panoply of war!
Paimon: But now that Paimon thinks about it, elemental power is super-duper-mega strong! If there was a material that could just easily resist something as powerful as the elements... That would be too good to be true!
Paimon: We probably shouldn't stand around daydreaming!
Fischl: Ah, the naivete! Do not jump to judge a cat familiar's talents through common sense! The semantic resources of mere mortal words struggle to accurately convey their properties.
Fischl: Perhaps somewhere in this world there exists a cat familiar that can... dive deep into the depths, endure in an inferno, and ride upon the wind! Such a special entity would surely have no fear of thunder or lightning.
Fischl: So long as I am patient in my search, I shall find it — forsooth, even if I should seek for ten years or a hundred, it shall be but a fleeting instant in the Immernachtreich!
Fischl: Additionally, the devotion to one's development in life is as important as the innate nature one is born with. I see this "Dopey" has immense potential. Perhaps after joining my retinue for a spell, it will become all the more familiar with the power of Electro!
Fischl: By happenstance, I, the Prinzessin, have disentangled a million myriad menial affairs, thus allowing myself a tincture of time to spare. Perhaps, then, it shall not hurt, endeavoring to stay here and familiarize myself with these cat familiars... particularly this "Dopey"!
Dopey: Meow!
Paimon: Hehe! Then Paimon hopes you'll have fun here in the Furball Fortress, Fischl!
(Talk to Fischl again, optional)
Fischl: No need to tremble before the Prinzessin. You have done well indeed to care for these cat familiars... flawlessly, even! Keep up the fine work!
Fischl: As the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, I shall remain here for a bit longer... Reading the poetry of the soul of these feline familiars.
 Your Royal Highness the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, how proceedeth thy reading?
Paimon: Yeah! Paimon's curious too. How're you getting along with the cats? Did you find any special ones?
Fischl: ...Hmph!
Fischl: It has been just a few short days, merely a snap of the fingers, however, and our promising feline retainers are yet deep in preparation to display their prodigious capabilities before my royal person.
Fischl: Only this creature with a name most humble, as though it was seeking to actively conceal its unique talents, this "Dopey," has dared to respond to my tests, and has proven relatively cooperative. Praiseworthy indeed!
Paimon: Wait... So the other cats just gave you the cold shoulder because they couldn't understand your... unique way of speaking...?
Paimon: And only "Dopey" is usually willing to spend time with you?
 Blasphemous slander! How could that be?
 Not surprising...
Fischl: *Ahem*... Such topics are unworthy of further examination!
Fischl: Cat Conjurors, the time has come for you to demonstrate your wisdom and offer up your counsel to mine august person...
Fischl: I am sure that by this time, you have long since gained deep insight into... All the habits and favorite victuals fancied by the feline familiars here within the Furball Fortress.
Paimon: Oh, so you just wanted to ask what the cats like to eat! That's an easy one.
Paimon: You sure are a quick study! The moment you noticed the cats ignoring you, you immediately thought of using food to get close to them...
 A classic stratagem!
 Most wise, Mein Prinzessin!
You describe the food preferences of several cats to Fischl, and based on Paimon's suggestions, come up with a few combinations that might make them especially happy...
Fischl: As expected! Such an intricate formulation could surely only be mastered by you, my Cat Conjurors most clever!
Fischl: To discern the potential of each of these feline retainers, I, the Prinzessin, must also reveal a suitable skill amongst my talents unnumbered, and show these cats the world...
Paimon: Hehe, good luck, Fischl!
Paimon: Though remember to exercise portion control! Even if it's their favorite foods, cats can't eat too much! Don't let them pig out or waste food!
 Paimon...
 (Stare...)
Paimon: H—H—Hey... Why are you looking at Paimon like that? P—Paimon always orders what she likes and finishes every morsel! She would never waste a crumb!
Paimon: A—At least, Paimon doesn't think she's ever wasted anything...? As for pigging out...
Paimon: Paimon may sometimes eat a bit more than usual, but that can't really count as pigging out!
 How has Oz been lately?
Paimon: Oh, right! What's Oz been up to while you've been playing in the Furball Fortress? Is he just... waiting by the door?
Paimon: Or did he go outside the city by himself? Could that be dangerous for him?
Fischl: Oho! Do not jest! This is Oz we speak of! Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, the being who reigns supreme over three universes!
Fischl: Surely, you are not concerned for his safety? Hardly necessary, I do say! Even at a hundred paces, a thousand paces, any harboring treacherous intent would be overwhelmed and over-awed by the mysterious depths of his gaze, and would never dare to act rashly!
Fischl: In our journey through the ages, it is inevitable that Oz and I will sometimes act separately.
Fischl: When Oz is not at his place by my side, he prefers peace and quiet, and will actively conceal his person rather than chat with mortals.
Fischl: Simply by observing the placid surface of a lake, Oz can sift through millions upon millions of memories, and from them, allow entirely new philosophies yet undreamt of to bubble up... This is one of his favorite pastimes.
Paimon: Paimon thinks she gets it... He should be by Cider Lake right now... Somewhere we can't see, resting and enjoying the breeze.
Paimon: So you get to have fun in the Furball Fortress, while Oz gets to treat himself, resting the way he likes. Seems like good deal for all!
 Very good indeed!
 Congratulations are in order!
Fischl: Naturally, I, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, cannot long linger here in this "Furball Fortress," for the pressing matters of many different worlds await the attention of Oz and myself...
Fischl: The next time I see you two, my good Cat Conjurors, I shall surely have sought out a... cat familiar who fears not Oz's might and majesty!
 Then we shall continue to dedicate ourselves to the cause!
Fischl: Most excellent indeed! The cat familiars all applaud your amazing work!
