  Quest-Exclusive NPCs 




Chan'er (Chinese: 婵儿 Chán'ér) is a quest-exclusive NPC that appears in Test of Courage in Chongyun's Hangout Event: Act I - Signs of Evil.
She and her boyfriend, Junjun, went on a date to Wuwang Hill. She had a bit of a tantrum, so Chongyun thought Junjun was an evil spirit and sought to exorcise him. But after the misunderstanding is cleared up, Chan'er and Junjun make up.
