Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Before completing The Children of Vimara Village.


Iosaphat: Oh, are you a guest from outside the village? If you haven't tried fishing, I implore you give it a try!
 I've fished enough.
Iosaphat: Haha, the look on your face tells me it's either you dislike fishing, or you're too good at it.
Iosaphat: Anyway, one must have a hobby to whittle away free time. I think fishing is a good way to go about that.
 Maybe next time.
Iosaphat: Sure, let's fish together when you have time!

Dialogue Set #2[]
After completing The Children of Vimara Village.


Iosaphat: Isn't this the guest Rana brought? What's up, is something wrong?
 About the children...
Iosaphat: Oh, those "tiger cubs"... They want to go into the forest every day, but children should have this sort of energy.
Iosaphat: Sudabeh and Kavus are just the child-version of me, haha...
Iosaphat: But I hope they can be more careful. They have been missing for days before. Everyone in the village was worried sick...
Iosaphat: Oh, if only my wife were here... She would be able to keep all the children in line.
Iosaphat: But she's a busy researcher. Right now she's in the Akademiya, conducting some sort of research...
 About Amadhiah...
Iosaphat: Oh, you mean my father. His eyesight has become worse, but he is still hale and hearty otherwise because he wanted to be an adventurer when he was young.
 Nothing...
Iosaphat: Haha, okay then... By the way, come fishing with me when you get the time!
