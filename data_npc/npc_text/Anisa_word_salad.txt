Profile[]
A descendant of the great sage Biruni who lived 500 years ago, Anisa is a Trainee Dastur at Sumeru Akademiya's Oceanographic Society.[1] Some time ago, Anisa traveled to Inazuma in search of two thesis subjects to become an official Dastur. she settled on researching the statues of Watatsumi and the tradition of puzzle-making and puzzle solving after she found the war between the Shogunate and the Watatsumi Army made it too difficult to study marine biology.[1]
On Watatsumi Island, Anisa met Kumi and learned about some of the folk tales passed down regarding the mechanisms on the island. During her research, she was captured by hilichurls but was saved by the Traveler. After being rescued, she promptly pulls the Traveler and Paimon into helping with her research on the nearby puzzle for her thesis. Following her breakthrough, the three return to Kumi.[1]
When Kumi grows melancholic over her deceased Umibouzu friend Kuntira, believing she must have died while stranded on the shore, Anisa deduces from Kuntira's remains that Kuntira had instead lived a fulfilling life, bore many children, and died of old age in the ocean. From Anisa's deduction, Kuntira's corpse washed up onto the beach because she returned to the area at the end of her life while thinking about her friendship with Kumi. The two ladies share a heartfelt moment with each other, to Paimon's mild consternation.[1]
Since then, Anisa has been staying with Kumi at Bourou Village. The two frequent the beach where Kuntira's remains are, and Anisa is trying to learn how to befriend Kuntira's offspring as part of her research into marine biology.

Dialogue[]

Anisa: Hi there!
 How have things been?
Anisa: Haha, good, good! Thanks for your concern!
Anisa: The weather here's good, the environment's pretty nice, and the food's just the best. Also, thanks to Little Kumi's care, I've had all the time and energy in the world to focus on my research!
Anisa: It's just that... I guess I worry her a bit when I go running around.
Anisa: Hehehe, I actually do feel a bit bad about it.
 It's good to see you again.
Anisa: Same here! It's always good to meet the person who saved my career in oceanography, you know?
Anisa: Ah yes, speaking of that, I've been studying the various fish species in the waters around Watatsumi Island to try to pin down the areas in which Kuntira's descendants might be living.
Anisa: And in the process, I discovered the great amount of diversity that exists among the oceanic creatures here! An unexpected boon indeed!
Anisa: *cough* Sorry, I got a little carried away. Regardless, thank you so much for your help.
 How's Kumi doing?
Anisa: Thanks to you, she's cheered up a lot.
Anisa: That said, she's taken all these tasks onto herself... Watching her run around like that makes me wish I could help her out a bit...
Anisa: Ah yes, speaking of that... I've learned how to make some local dishes from Little Kumi in the meantime, and I've also added a little spin on them from my hometown.
Anisa: Hehe, I'm sure you'd like it!
Anisa: Wanna try some when you get the chance next time?
 Bye!
Anisa: Travel safe!

So in this case, they're referring to themselves as the children and students of the great sages of old.Paimon: Huh, so that's what it means... From the way they were throwing these words around, Paimon was sure it'd be something to be proud of.(Traveler): Wait... But isn't it?Paimon: Well, Paimon for one would much rather be known as the founding father than have a name that basically says "So-and-so's my daddy." Pretty embarrassing, don't you think?(Traveler): Um... I have to admit, I've never thought about it like that...
Trivia[]
Anisa may be the researcher who wrote the Scribbled Notes found around Yashiori Island. Notably, the author of the Scribbled Notes displays interest in both marine biology, specifically regarding Umibouzu, and in the contraptions around the island. After failing to find any solid leads on Umibouzu, the author of the Scribbled Notes decides to travel to the other islands of Inazuma, suggesting they could be found elsewhere.
The unknown researcher who left the Researcher's Notes on Watatsumi Island displays a similar interest in ruins and ancient contraptions, like Anisa and the author of the Scribbled Notes. However, the achievement for finding all the Researcher's Notes is called "The Stranding of The Beagle," implying that the unknown researcher was shipwrecked on Watatsumi Island, whereas Anisa never gives any such indication.
Etymology[]
Her surname, Purbiruni, is derived from her ancestor Biruni. This name may be a reference to Al-Biruni, a Persian scholar during the Islamic Golden Age who is known as the "first anthropologist," among many epithets.
Anisa in Persian آنیسا means "great fighter" or "the essence of love," and in Arabic اَنیسا the name Anisa means "pleasant companion." As can be seen, the hat on top of the name is different in both languages.
