Dialogue[]

Veleda: Hello, dear human. I was just considering a problem a moment ago, so I almost didn't notice you.
 Could I ask what you were considering?
Veleda: Of course you can. I was wondering how humanity came about.
Veleda: We Melusines were born of Elynas. So I've often been wondering — how did the first human in this world come to be?
Veleda: Were they born from flesh and blood like we were? Or were they created in some other way?
 I'm not from Teyvat, so...
Veleda: Oh, is that so?
Veleda: Never mind. It's just one of those thoughts that cross my mind, you know? There are so many things in this world that we Melusines are unable to understand... I'm used to it.
Veleda: Still, thank you! Please take this small souvenir.
(Obtain 4★  Masterpiece's Overture)
 See you.
Veleda: Bye!
