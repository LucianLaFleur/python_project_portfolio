Grace's location (Daytime)Additional context
Profile[]
Grace serves as a motherly figure to children in Mondstadt who were either abandoned or otherwise lack parental figures in their lives. Three people she is known to take care of are Glory,[3] Timmie, and Nora.[4]
Both Glory and Timmie call Grace their mother, though she tells the Traveler that Timmie is not biologically related to her, while Glory's parentage is unknown. Nora does not speak about her mother and only mentions her father, Patton, who is too busy repaying his debt to Angel's Share to care for Nora.
During the event Unreconciled Stars, she gives the quest "That Which Fell From the Sky."

Appearance[]
Grace is a woman with blonde hair and blue eyes. She wears the standard Church of Favonius nun attire.

Dialogue[]

Grace: If you wish to pray to Barbatos, you can do it here.
 About Stormterror...
(After completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
Grace: I fear that this is one of the causes for the unease in everyone's hearts...
Grace: I am not a Knight of Favonius, and so, I can only pray to the winds.
Grace: Oh, Lord Barbatos, defend the people of Mondstadt.
(After completing A Long Shot)
Grace: Lord Barbatos has indeed heard our prayers. Mondstadt is safe once again.
Grace: Although I say that it is over, Dvalin's influence will likely remain for a while longer...
Grace: But I believe that as long as the winds of Mondstadt persist, Lord Barbatos will always be with us.
Grace: ...Perhaps he is already amongst us. Who can say?
 What are you doing?
Grace: Recently, there's uneasiness in the air. So I'm praying to Barbatos.
Grace: Be at ease. Barbatos will help us.
 Tell me about Barbatos.
Grace: Barbatos is a very gentle archon.
Grace: His wind grants happiness to the people of the city and wipes the tears off their faces.
 Tell me about praying to Barbatos.
Grace: If you wish to pray to Barbatos, just speak your wishes when there's a breeze...
Grace: It will carry your wish to Barbatos.
 About those unsettling omens I keep seeing...
Grace: No matter what the cause may be, all we can do is pray.
Grace: I had some adventurers help me collect some Cecilia buds to give everyone...
Grace: These flowers grow on top of cliffs, whisked by the Mondstadt winds...
Grace: Perhaps these flowers that emanate the essence of Barbatos can bring some peace of mind to everyone.
Grace: Here, please take some. May Barbatos shine upon Mondstadt.
(Obtain  Cecilia ×3)
 Goodbye.
Grace: May Barbatos' gentle wind be with you.

Event Dialogue[]
Invitation of Windblume[]

Grace: Nowadays, no one truly knows what the Windblume is.
Grace: There are some who have judged that the flower simply does not exist, save in legend and song only.
Grace: The way I see it, Windblumes are real so long as there are those who believe in it.
Grace: As to which flower it might be, I think that everyone is free to decide that for themselves.
Grace: I believe that this "freedom to choose" is what Lord Barbatos would have wished for us to have...
 What are you doing?
