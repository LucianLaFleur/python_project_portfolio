Dialogue[]

Hunayn: ...
Hunayn: Hello. How can I help you?
 Who are you...
Hunayn: I came to borrow some books. I've been applying for additional permits to borrow more books.
Hunayn: I've read almost everything on general knowledge that I can borrow from here. Hope my mentor can give me access to other books soon.
 Do you have any recommended reads?
Hunayn: It depends on which Darshan and subject you're interested in.
Hunayn: I can give you a list based on that.
Hunayn: But only researchers and students at the Akademiya can borrow books from the House of Daena, so you will need a permit.
 Sorry to bother you...
Hunayn: No worries.

Event Dialogue[]
A Parade of Providence[]

Hunayn: Huh? I didn't think someone would want to chat with me even now. Aren't you joining in on the Akademiya Extravaganza?
Hunayn: Hmm... What fun events are there... Truth be told, I'm not one for such occasions, so I can't say.
Hunayn: However, I don't dislike these celebratory events. The more students join in such galas, the quieter things are over here.
