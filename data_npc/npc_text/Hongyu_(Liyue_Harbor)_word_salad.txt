Dialogue[]

Hongyu: Hey, it's a traveler. I'm free to chat if you want? While the sergeant's is not here.
 About Rex Lapis' death...
(After completing Rite of Descension)

Hongyu: Whoa, come on now. When I said we could chat, I didn't mean sensitive topics like that. That's off limits.
Hongyu: Take it from me, no self-respecting Liyue local is gonna want to broach that topic lightly.
Hongyu: ...Ahem, I must stay at my post. If there's nothing else you need, please leave me be.
(After completing The Fond Farewell)

Hongyu: I was there at the Rite of Descension too. The Qixing has told us to maintain absolute secrecy about the matter at the time.
Hongyu: But now that the Rite of Parting is finished, everyone is aware of the situation. There's no need for us Millelith to keep silent about it any longer...
Hongyu: But even so... I'm sorry, I still can't bring myself to discuss this topic any further.
Hongyu: Rex Lapis... *sigh*
 Who are you?
Hongyu: We're Millelith guards for this area. I'm Hongyu, and that's Kun.
Hongyu: Liyue Harbor's a pretty safe place. I've not seen any big trouble ever since I've been in uniform. Maybe you have a bit more pickpockets and petty thieves around Chihu Rock, but that's about it.
Hongyu: Hey, have you heard about the Lantern Rite?
Hongyu: It's a festival people in Liyue celebrate. Takes place on the night of the first full moon every year. It's the biggest festival of the whole year, too.
Hongyu: On the day of the festival, the whole city lights lanterns all night long. It makes the place as bright as day.
Hongyu: Also, we have a special floating lantern too. Unique to Liyue. It's quite a sight to behold, and you won't find anything like it elsewhere.
Hongyu: Anyway, just thought if you're new in town, it's something you definitely wouldn't want to miss!
 Anything interesting happening around here?
Hongyu: No, I wouldn't say that anything interesting has happened. But I did encounter something weird recently...
Hongyu: There was something quite not right about my house. If it wasn't a bowl or chopsticks moving all of a sudden, then it was a chair suddenly falling over.
Hongyu: After talking this through with a friend, he introduced me to an exorcist named Chongyun. They say he's a specialist in these bump-in-the-night matters.
Hongyu: But the instant that exorcist walked into the room, all the strange happenings stopped right away! He didn't even need to work any thaumaturgy!
Hongyu: It truly is weird. I still have no idea how that might have happened...
 Sorry, I have things to do.
Hongyu: *sigh* Okay then. Shame, don't get this sort of freedom very often.

Event Dialogue[]
Fleeting Colors in Flight[]

Hongyu: I saw a white-haired lady around these parts a couple of days ago. She was incredibly beautiful — had an extraordinary air about her to boot.
Hongyu: But just as I wanted to get a closer look, she suddenly disappeared...
Hongyu: Actually, now that I think about it, did I encounter some passing adeptus?

The Exquisite Night Chimes[]

Hongyu: Things feel more or less the same, year after year...
Hongyu: Not that it's a bad thing. Though nothing particularly good happened, there was nothing bad either.
Hongyu: I hope next year will go smoothly as usual.
(Continue non-event dialogue options)

Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze[]

Hongyu: New year, new horizons!
Hongyu: I mean, look, the kites this year have mechanical devices on them. Next thing you know, we'll be mounting compasses on our Xiao Lanterns!
Hongyu: That way, we can get them to send letters just like our pigeons.
Hongyu: Hmm? You think I'm kidding? Well, maybe I am!
