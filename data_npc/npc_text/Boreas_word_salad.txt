Lupus Boreas, also known as Andrius, is the Wolf of the North of Mondstadt's Four Winds.[8] He was a powerful god in Mondstadt best known for his war against Decarabian, the God of Storms, during the Archon War. Towards the end of the era, Boreas chose to let his physical body die, leaving behind his spirit to watch over the land of Mondstadt.
Boreas later became one of the Four Winds tasked with protecting the nation under the request of the Anemo Archon Barbatos. At some point in time, he took up residence in Wolvendom, where he can manifest a temporary form made of ice and wind to do battle against those who take up his challenge. After completing Razor's Story Quest Lupus Minor Chapter: Act I - The Meaning of Lupical, Boreas can be fought in the Wolf of the North Challenge, and successfully completing the challenge yields rewards once per week.

Introduction[]
A noble soul that watches over Wolvendom. When the safety of the wolves is threatened, it will take the form of a wolf and show its fangs and claws. It is said that its powers were given to it by an ancient god.—Adventurer Handbook description
The noblest and greatest of souls, who watches over the lupical of Wolvendom.
When the wolfpack is imperiled, it will emerge in the form of a wolf and show forth its fangs and claws.
The wolves of Wolvendom are frightening phantoms to the people of Mondstadt:
A blurred shape flashing through the forest, a chilling howl in the indeterminate distance, the creeping sense of eyes constantly nailed to their backs...

Humans rarely have the opportunity to lock their eyes with a wolf, for this is the law Lupus Boreas laid down for its race.—Archive description
Appearance[]
Boreas' true appearance remains unknown. As the Dominator of Wolves, Boreas takes the form of a large bluish-colored Wolf.

Story[]
History[]
Long in the past, Boreas' powers were given to him by an ancient god.[9] It is currently unknown who this god was, but this put Boreas on the level of a god himself.
Sometime during the Archon War, hostility arose between Boreas and Decarabian. Boreas declared war on Decarabian while Decarabian enclosed his capital city — the area now known as Stormterror's Lair — within a storm wall,[3] thus starting the era known as the Age of Kings.[2] They were collectively known as Kings of Ice and Frost[10] and reached a stalemate: Boreas failed to land even a scratch on the Lord of the Tower,[11] while Decarabian was either incapable of — or uninterested in — defeating Boreas. However, Decarabian's people grew discontent with his rule. 2600 years ago, they rose up against him with the help of Barbatos, culminating in Decarabian's death.[12][13]
At some point during the Archon War, Boreas decided that he was unworthy of becoming the Anemo Archon due to his perceived lack of love for humanity that an Archon ought to have.[14] Realizing his blizzards could only take lives and not nourish them, he chose to pass on, letting his power flow into the land to nurture it and its people.[15] It is unclear when exactly this occurred relative to Decarabian's death, but it was likely around the same time or right beforehand.
Upon the death of his physical body, part of Boreas' spirit and power took on its current icy form. However, this form is incapable of harnessing his full abilities.[16] Around 1000 years ago, after Vennessa's rebellion against the Mondstadt Aristocracy, Boreas officially became one of the Four Winds of Mondstadt, while the Knight of Boreas — a position that currently holds an unknown relationship to him — joined the newly established Knights of Favonius. In the past, the Temple of the Wolf located near the Thousand Winds Temple was used to worship him, but it has long been abandoned, while Boreas' spirit dwells on the other side of Mondstadt.
Boreas would eventually become the leader of a group of wolves in Wolvendom, while continuing to accept abandoned infants into his pack. Sometime before the start of the game, he found and took in Razor. The Knights of Favonius' current Grand Master, Varka, is also the current Knight of Boreas. Before he went on his expedition, he would occasionally visit Wolvendom;[17] however, his relationship to Boreas is currently unclear.

Story Quests[]
Sometime after the Stormterror Crisis was resolved, Springvale was attacked by rifthounds, which the residents of the village blamed Boreas' wolf pack and Razor for despite Razor's insistence that they were not responsible. After hearing the arguing, Boreas emerged and challenged both Razor and the Traveler to prove their conviction. Upon being satisfied, he informed the group that Razor was telling the truth and told Razor not to get involved in the upcoming battle between the packs, for he is a human and not a wolf.[8]

Archon Quests[]
When the Traveler goes to Wolvendom to investigate the Abyss Order, Boreas is once again briefly seen being restrained by the Abyss Herald, attempting to corrupt Boreas like how they did with Dvalin. After a short fight, the Abyss Herald is defeated and the wolf spirit is freed. Paimon asks Boreas about the "Field Tiller" (the codename of the first Ruin Guards), Boreas then explains that it had previously stumbled upon his territory, and he mistook the machine to be a challenger.[1] During the fight, Boreas dealt a damaging blow on the Field Tiller, who then fled the area. Furthermore, Dainsleif mentions that Boreas's body died long ago and that his spirit is what resides over Wolvendom.

Etymology[]
Boreas is the God of the North Wind in Greek mythology, directly relating to Boreas being the representative of the North amongst the Four Winds.
His English title, Lupus Boreas, roughly means "Wolf of the North Wind."
Following the theme of gods in Genshin Impact being named after demons in the Ars Goetia, 安德留斯 Āndéliúsī, "Andrius" is likely derived from 安德雷斐斯 Āndéléifěisī, "Andrealphus," the 65th demon. In Johann Weyers' Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, Andrealphus is instead the 54th demon.
It has also been theorized that Andrius is based on Andras, the 63rd demon who is said to be highly dangerous and rode on a black wolf. However, Andras' Chinese name, 安托士 Āntuōshì, has much less in common with Andrius' Chinese name than Andrealphus' does. For this same reason, 安杜馬利烏士 Āndùmǎlìwūshì, "Andromalius" is also a less likely name basis.
