Dialogue[]

Inagi Hotomi: Hello, Traveler from afar. Welcome to the Grand Narukami Shrine!
Inagi Hotomi: If you encounter any trouble or just want to make a wish, feel free to come here for a fortune slip. May the Electro Archon bless you.
 About Gendou Ringo...
(After completing The Very Special Fortune Slip)
Inagi Hotomi: Ah yes. I do believe that people have been saying that her attitude's gotten a lot better recently.
Inagi Hotomi: Although rather than calling it an attitude adjustment, it might be more accurate to say that "she seems like a different person," no?
 ...
Inagi Hotomi: Haha. Not to worry, everyone at the shrine already knew, more or less.
Inagi Hotomi: Although I'm not privy to the details, if Lady Yae has allowed her to stay at the shrine, then she is someone we can trust.
 About the Cleansing Ritual...
(After completing Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual)
Inagi Hotomi: Lady Yae did ask us to make some arrangements for the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual earlier.
Inagi Hotomi: Later, she said that new developments had precluded the need for us to continue our preparations. She even asked me to give the Memento Lens to a blond-haired outlander.
Inagi Hotomi: I never expected that the "new development" that Lady Yae mentioned was you.
Inagi Hotomi: You have my thanks. I do not know how you managed it, but healing the Sacred Sakura was no mean feat. You have my utmost thanks as a shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine.
 Could you tell me about Hanachirusato...
Inagi Hotomi: Hanachirusato? I don't believe that any such person works at the Grand Narukami Shrine...
Inagi Hotomi: Speaking of which, we found an antique kitsune mask while cleaning up the shrine hall. It seems to have once belonged to Lady Kitsune Saiguu.
Inagi Hotomi: If you don't mind, would you like to have it? Since you were the one who completed the Cleansing Ritual, I believe there must be some fate that ties you, Lady Saiguu, and the shrine together.
Inagi Hotomi: It's become a little fragile with its great age, so you can't really wear it, but I believe it must at least bear some sentiments and blessings from bygone years.
(Obtain  A Mask)
 About drawing fortune slips...
Inagi Hotomi: Locals who want to make wishes often come here for fortune slips to seek the protection of our Archon.
Inagi Hotomi: Although you are a Traveler from the outside world, you will still be blessed if you believe in her.
 Everyone's wishes, huh...
(Before completing Transient Dreams)

Inagi Hotomi: Yes... I've been in charge of greeting the people coming here for fortune slips for a while now, and I have heard all sorts of wishes from all manner of people.
Inagi Hotomi: Many who came here recently wished for the Sakoku Decree to be lifted soon...
Inagi Hotomi: The Electro Archon... Hm, never mind.
Inagi Hotomi: As a shrine maiden, I should always follow and serve the Electro Archon. My life for the Eternal Narukami.
(After completing Transient Dreams)

Inagi Hotomi: Yes... I've been in charge of greeting the people coming here for fortune slips for a while now, and I have heard all sorts of wishes from all manner of people.
Inagi Hotomi: Many have come lately to thank the Electro Archon for abolishing the country's closing, and to pray for a flourishing business or safe travels.
Inagi Hotomi: As a shrine maiden, I should always follow and serve the Electro Archon. My life for the Eternal Narukami.
 Could you tell me more about the Grand Narukami Shrine?
Inagi Hotomi: The Grand Narukami Shrine is a place for making offerings and performing ceremonial affairs. Everything here is done according to the will of Her Excellency the Electro Archon.
Inagi Hotomi: Lady Yae Miko is the head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine. She is in charge of everything here.
Inagi Hotomi: But Lady Yae is very busy indeed, and she is also the boss of Yae Publishing House. So when she is not around, I will take over some of her work.
Inagi Hotomi: If you need any help from the shrine, feel free to ask me.
 Goodbye.
Inagi Hotomi: May the Electro Archon protect you! Take care.

Trivia[]
