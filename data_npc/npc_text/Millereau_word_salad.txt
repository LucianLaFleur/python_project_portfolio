Dialogue[]

Millereau: Hmm? Are you interested in the Mutual Aid Network? I'd be happy to tell you more about it, if you'd like.
 What are you doing?
Millereau: As you can see, I'm spreading the word about the Mutual Aid Network's philosophy in the hopes of getting more people to join us.
 It doesn't look like anyone wants to come learn.
Millereau: I'm surprised you saw our dilemma so quickly...
Millereau: It's true — the Mutual Aid Network is a small group. Few people are interested in us, let alone want to join us.
Millereau: But I still believe that my work is meaningful.
Millereau: When I first arrived in the Fortress of Meropide, I was completely lost. I passed each day in a daze, not daring to think about anything to do with the future.
Millereau: It was only after I joined the Mutual Aid Network that I gradually began to realize that in this world, there are many "things that I can still do."
Millereau: Even if it's just a few, insignificant little things, I can still get a sense of fulfillment from doing them...
Millereau: I hope I can introduce this mindset to more people. I want to help others completely transform themselves, and once more stand upright beneath the light.
 See you.
Millereau: Ah... See you. If you need any help, you know where to find me.
