Introduction[]
The Mountain Shaper's power stems from both inner enlightenment and external knowledge. As the dragon spits that which turns to amber, and as the swallow regurgitates that which becomes its nest, so the adeptus harnessed the power of nature to build an amber prison.—Stone tablet on Mt. Hulao
Appearance[]
Mountain Shaper appears as a red and orange colored crane, with a pattern of both on of his wings. In his human form, he takes the appearance of a bespectacled young man, with a red streak of hair among his dark brown hair.

Story[]
History[]
Mountain Shaper was among the adepti summoned by Morax to fight during the Archon War. At some point in time, alongside Moon Carver and an unknown adeptus, he participated in the subjugation of Azhdaha.[2]
Several hundred years ago, during a battle between adepti and demons, an herb gatherer named Qiqi ended up getting caught in the crossfire. The adepti and demons stopped their fight after witnessing the ill-fated maiden receiving a Vision in her last breaths. The adepti couldn't bear to see her die; they gave some of their power to revive her. However, the little girl could not handle such tremendous energy, causing her to go on a rampage. To quell the madness, Mountain Shaper imprisoned her in amber.[3]

Present[]
Mountain Shaper is first met when the Traveler and Paimon go to the adepti to absolve themselves of the accusation that they assassinated Morax during the Rite of Descension. After hearing the news of the archon's death, Mountain Shaper decides to convene with his fellow adepti, though not before ensuring that the karst crawlers would not encase any innocent beings in his absence.[4]
The adepti later confronted the Liyue Qixing directly, throwing Liyue Harbor into chaos.[5] During this time, Childe attempted to extract the Gnosis from the Exuvia, only to discover that the Exuvia had been a fake body all along — the real Morax was still alive somewhere. To lure him out, Childe unleashed the Fatui-manufactured Sigils of Permission to unseal the ancient god Osial.[6] In the face of this new threat, the adepti and Qixing worked together to reseal Osial.[7]
During the second Lantern Rite without Morax, Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper went on a brief journey, returning to the mountains just as the fireworks festival was about to start in Liyue.[8] During the next Lantern Rite, they reunited with Morax (now in the form of Zhongli) and were joined by the Traveler and Paimon before enjoying some Bamboo Shoot Soup cooked with Cloud Retainer's adeptal mechanism.[9]
As the fourth Lantern Rite approached, Cloud Retainer, having assumed the human form of Xianyun, took up residence in Liyue Harbor and failed to visit him and Mountain Shaper, so the two also transformed into humans and went to the harbor hoping to find her. There, they were found by Paimon listening in on her talking with the Traveler, Keqing and Charlotte about kite-making with Fontaine's technology. Upon being confronted, Moon Carver revealed his identity but asked to be addressed as Houzhang, while Mountain Shaper named himself Jiehu. Paimon refused to believe them to be the adepti she knew, so they had to recount some of their previous experiences only known to them to convince her and the Traveler. Having learnt the theme of this year's Lantern Rite, they decided that Cloud Retainer was in no mood of greeting them due to her low opinion of mortal technology, and thus departed.[10]
Two days later, Houzhang and Jiehu were near Mt. Aocang when they tried out the Fontainian motor technology with a kite depicting the Jade Chamber and accidentally lost it. Having seen it drifting in the direction of the mountain, Jiehu was afraid it might be discovered by Xianyun, but Houzhang was confident that she would not be out in the vicinity. Unbeknownst to them, Xianyun was running a kite-making workshop and happened to intercept the kite, which prompted her to go investigate at once. The two became flustered the moment she appeared in person, and after some private exchange, decided to play dumb, but Paimon then arrived with the Traveler and immediately exposed their identities. Xianyun, however, claimed she had long known. They tried to flatter her mechanical prowess, but she dismissed them and left. They then determined to continue flying the kite at Mt. Hulao.[11]
Having learnt of the discord between Gaming and his father Yip Tak that arose from the former's career choices, Xianyun was eager to help them resolve their differences in light of the festive occasion, and thus in the next two days enlisted the help of Houzhang and Jiehu, asking them to play the roles of Treasure Hoarders pretending to attack Gaming while escorting goods in the presence of his father. When the plan was carried out, Gaming was quick to defend himself and even prepared to strike first, so Houzhang and Jiehu retreated with the intention of luring him away. While pursuing them, Gaming astutely sensed from their actual abilities that they weren't usual ruthless bandits, and deduced that it had been staged. The plans however were ultimately successful, and when the festivities at Liyue Harbor began, Houzhang and Jiehu watched as Yip Tak enjoyed Gaming's Wushou Dance.[12]
