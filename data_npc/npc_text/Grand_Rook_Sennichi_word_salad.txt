Trivia[]
In Japanese, this NPC's name includes the word 飛車 hisha, "flying chariot," referring to the rook-equivalent piece in shogi. Within a shogi context, the name 千日 Sennichi, lit. "thousand days" takes on another meaning, alluding to 千日手 sennichite, lit. "moves for a thousand days," a rule in shogi stating that the game will end in a draw if the same position is repeated four times during a game. This allusion fits well with his stubborn and combative attitude.
