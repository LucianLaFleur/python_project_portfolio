Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(After competing The Children of Vimara Village)
Amadhiah: Ah, friends of Rana, sorry about before. I must apologize for my aging eyes.
 About the mysterious creatures we saw before...
Amadhiah: You mean the round little plantlike fairies? I think I saw them before, but when and what was it...?
 Are they called Aranara?
Amadhiah: Aranara... Probably. I might have heard stories before, but I'm too old to remember for sure.
Amadhiah: The forests of Sumeru are very big, teeming with countless wondrous creatures. But one won't miss what they're destined to find.
Amadhiah: However, if I was destined, I shouldn't have forgotten about them, either. So when was it...?
 About Rana...
Amadhiah: Rana is a good kid. She works hard every day to keep this old man and the children in Vimara Village safe.
Amadhiah: I wonder when she'll have time to start a family and settle down.
 See you.
Amadhiah: Okay, goodbye.

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After competing The World of Aranara)
Amadhiah: It's Rana's little guest. Well, Rana is a good guide, isn't she?
 Your vision...
Amadhiah: Oh, my apologies. Now that I'm getting on in years, my eyes are not as sharp as they used to be. Everything is a blurry shadow to me. Luckily, my ears still work well...
Amadhiah: I'm really sorry about before...
 About the children...
Amadhiah: Oh, the "tiger cubs"? They are all good children, always full of energy... I wish them the blessings of Lesser Lord Kusanali. One day, they will grow up, safe and healthy.
 About Rana...
Amadhiah: Rana... *sigh* She's been a smart girl since childhood... but sometimes she is too headstrong.
Amadhiah: After becoming a Forest Watcher, she's returned to the village less often. Forest Watchers are busy, I understand that. I'm just worried if she's getting enough rest...
 See you.
Amadhiah: Well then, I won't keep you any longer...
Amadhiah: Oh, one more thing, little guest. If you ever meet Rana, please remind her to take more rest...

Dialogue Set #3[]

(After competing The Bad Guy in Vimara Village)
Amadhiah: It's Rana's little guest. If you're looking for Rana, she's gone on a trip and won't be back for a while.
 About Rana...
Amadhiah: She returned all of a sudden, saying that she was to "go on a trip with a very, very important friend"...
Amadhiah: She sounded very serious... Only those who have traveled understand the meaning of a journey. I hope she'll find what she's been looking for...
 About the musical instrument...
Amadhiah: That instrument, huh? You can have it.
Amadhiah: It belongs to wayfarers who travel like the wind. But it's been by my side for far too long.
Amadhiah: Please let it sing in the woods, I guess that won't let the poet lady's goodwill go to waste...
 About your past...
Amadhiah: Those are all stories of the past. I gave up on becoming an adventurer, but I don't regret it...
Amadhiah: Every person has their own path in life...
 About Alphonso...
Amadhiah: That child, Alphonso... Why did he leave without a word? He lived in Vimara Village for many years. Everyone said he's a good child...
 He might never come back again...
Amadhiah: *sigh* He is a good child. Sometimes, he seemed preoccupied with something. I felt I was not in the position to ask...
Amadhiah: I hope he will stop worrying about those things in the future.
 See you.
Amadhiah: Well then, I won't keep you any longer...
