Profile[]
Utamarou's paintings are well known across Inazuma and have since been mass-produced to the point that they are cheap household curiosities. The Traveler has apparently seen Yoimiya using one as kindling, Thoma using one to pad a table leg, and Sayu using a stack of them as a cushion.[1]
"Kichiboushi" also claims to have seen Utamarou drawing in the past, saying that Utamarou took a very long time to produce one work.[2]

Trivia[]
Utamarou may be a reference to Kitagawa Utamaro, an 18th-century Japanese ukiyo-e artist.
