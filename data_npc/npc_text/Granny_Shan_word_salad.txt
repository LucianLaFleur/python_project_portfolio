 To make people smile.

During Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze

 The kite of your dreams...

Dialogue[]

Granny Shan: Smiling makes the world a more beautiful place! See any toys you like?
 What do you have to sell here?
Granny Shan: What you see is what I've got. Have a look, perhaps there might be something that catches your eye.

 About the toys...
Granny Shan: Oh, children love them. Intricate things, they are.
Granny Shan: I've got toys for adults too, if you'd like.
 Adult toys...?
Granny Shan: Sorry, I should have been more specific. Some toys need adult supervision — kites for example.
Granny Shan: Come war and famine or the peace and prosperity we know today, happiness is always something worth striving for, don't you think?
 So, about Rex Lapis...
Granny Shan: Rex Lapis? I understand. Does your little one back home also want a Rex Lapis-themed toy?
Granny Shan: Have a look: dragon horn tops, stone dice, a dragon-shaped wooden sword, a kite with Rex Lapis' portrait on it... which would you like?
Granny Shan: Ah... So you're just asking around. I see. Rex Lapis-themed toys are so very popular among the children, so I naturally thought that...
 See you.
Granny Shan: Goodbye! Take care now.

Event Dialogue[]
Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze[]

Granny Shan: Happy Lantern Rite, youngster! See any toys you like?
 Tell me about kites...
Granny Shan: Ah, so you're here to buy one, are you?
Granny Shan: There's lots of new designs for this year's Lantern Rite, and some of them have come equipped with devices that will let them fly more easily...
Granny Shan: As for me, I just have some traditional patterns, and all these newfangled items do rather confuse me. If you want to buy them, you might want to drop by Zhenyuan's stall.
Granny Shan: She's my niece, and she came to Liyue Harbor from Chenyu Vale this year to do business. Young people are full of energy, but they can be prone to mistakes, so please do take care of her.
