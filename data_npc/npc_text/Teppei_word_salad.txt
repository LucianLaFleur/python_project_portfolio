Profile[]
Teppei is a member of the Watatsumi Army that fought against the Raiden Shogun's oppressive rule and Vision Hunt Decree. He first served in the logistics division before being sent to the front lines and assigned to the Gobius Platoon.

Story[]
While Teppei is at Nazuchi Beach, Yoriki Samurai attack him. The Traveler arrives in time to save him. Surprised by their ability to control the elements without a Vision, Teppei decides to bring the Traveler to the resistance camp at Fort Fujitou and introduce them to General Gorou. After a tour around the camp, Teppei joins the Traveler in a battle against the Shogunate forces led by Kujou Sara. The resistance is victorious with the arrival of Sangonomiya Kokomi and hired mercenaries, upon which she asks the Traveler to meet her at Sangonomiya Shrine. Teppei offers to continue being a guide for the Traveler. The Traveler and Teppei later rendezvous with each other and set off to Watatsumi Island by sea.
During the meeting with Kokomi at the Sangonomiya Shrine, Teppei is shocked when she appoints the Traveler as the new captain of the Swordfish II unit. Wishing to show his worth in battle, Kokomi grants his request by allowing him to participate in a battle against the Shogun's Navy. Teppei's achievements during the battle land him a position as the captain of the newly formed Herring I unit.
At one point, Teppei meets some mysterious people claiming to be supporters who then give him a "secret weapon" and is unaware that it is a Delusion. As he continues using the "weapon," he grows inexplicably weak. Teppei believes he is only exhausted from battle. After realizing that the Fatui had been supporting the resistance with Delusions, the Traveler rushes to Teppei to see that he had significantly aged. He soon succumbs to the Delusion's effects and dies.[4]

Appearance[]
Teppei wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the ashigaru (Japanese: 足軽) of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient shitagi with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray kobakama, and waraji sandals without socks. Although not visible, the Sangonomiya Clan's crest is imprinted on the back of the shitagi, below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with sode (shoulder armor), han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it.
When Teppei aged from the Delusion's effects, he has light gray hair and wrinkles on his face.
