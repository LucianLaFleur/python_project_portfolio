Shouta's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Shouta is seen praying at a local shrine and making food offerings to the Archons to try and get his wishes granted. To help with this task, he placed commissions with the Adventurers' Guild, which was answered by the Traveler. At their advice, he left candies at the other shrines, only for them to mysteriously disappear when he checked on them. The candies had been thrown out by Treasure Hoarders, and after speaking with Yayoi Nanatsuki, she told him that the deity had answered his prayers, albeit in the wrong way; when he saw the person he disliked, he fled the area, refusing to take an exam.

Appearance[]
Shouta is a young boy with dark hair and dark green eyes. He wears a beige shirt with green stripes and black shorts.

 Archons, please!
Media:VO Shouta 01.ogg "Archons, please! These are all the snacks I have. Please let me grow up faster!"

Dialogue[]

Shouta: The Konpeito candies I brought back last time were finished overnight. I guess the archon must be really fond of them.
Shouta: I have placed the rest in here this time. I'm sure it will...
 What are you doing?
Shouta: I've heard that I can make a wish to the archon once I have placed the offering in the shrine. If the archon likes my offering, my wish will definitely be granted.
Shouta: I have brought all of my snacks here today, and I'd like to wish that the archon will cancel the exam tomorrow!
 Has it ever worked?
Shouta: Hmm... It works about once in a dozen times... Last time, I wished bad luck upon someone who bullied me, and then he flunked his exam, haha!
Shouta: ...What? You don't believe me? Why do you look so skeptical?
Shouta: The archon is real. I won't allow you to doubt that! After all, wishes don't come true if your heart isn't earnest...
Shouta: Those bad guys who laughed at me for having my snacks stolen won't be blessed, I know it. Their teacher will never get diarrhea. When they borrow comic books, they'll always be missing the next volume!
 Such specific punishments.
Shouta: Hmph, that's what they'll get for being bad guys!
Shouta: The archon will let everyone know that you'll only be rewarded for being an awesome person like Yoimiya.
Shouta: Yoimiya never ridicules me. She will offer me little fireworks for fun, and she encourages me to study hard... In my mind, she's the greatest person ever — besides my family, of course!
Shouta: Not like that big guy with the horns. He would play cards with me and win all of my snacks. Ugh, and I don't even have that many snacks to lose...
 What did you offer?
Shouta: Wh—What do you want? Are you planning to take these snacks?
Shouta: You can't do that! You'll bring bad luck onto yourself if you steal other people's offerings!
Shouta: Uhh... How about I give these Onikabuto to you?
Shouta: I caught them with my friends. They don't seem like something I can offer to the deities. You can have them, but in return, don't touch my snacks, okay?
(Obtain  Onikabuto ×4)
 Goodbye.
Shouta: I'm sure the archon will bless me this time!

Trivia[]
Based on the rumors about Arataki Itto recounted by Rie, he is likely the "big guy with the horns" who wins all of Shouta's snacks.
He shares the same English VA as the Raiden Shogun.
