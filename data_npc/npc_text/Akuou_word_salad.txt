"Akuou" (Japanese: 惡王 Akuou), also known as Touzannou (Japanese: 東山王 Touzannou) amongst the Watatsumi people, was a historical figure from Watatsumi Island, Inazuma who lived around two thousand years ago. He was a major figure in the Narukami-Watatsumi War.
Akuou wielded the claymore Akuoumaru, which has since been named after him.[1] The Formation Estate was built on the mountain that he conquered during the Watatsumi Islanders' invasion of Yashiori Island.

Profile[]
Akuou was one of the three generals of Watatsumi's invasion force during the Narukami-Watatsumi War over Yashiori Island around 2,000 years ago. For his accomplishments in battle, Orobashi granted him the title "Touzannou" (King of the Eastern Mountain). Akuou dueled the Great Tengu Sasayuri[1] and may have been the one who killed them. He was later slain alongside Orobashi when Ei unleashed Musou no Hitotachi.

Story[]
An orphan of unknown origins and without a name, Akuou was taken in by Orobashi and was apprenticed to the shrine maiden Mouun and her twin sister Ayame. He was particularly close with Mouun, and his biography indicates that the two were lovers.[2]
From the two, Akuou learned the art of whalesong and the rites of Watatsumi, and also developed his own blade techniques known as "Getsumouun" and "Yuushio."[2]

Narukami-Watatsumi War[]
Along with Orobashi, Akuou, Ayame, and Mouun led the Watatsumi people in the invasion of Yashiori Island, which was under Makoto's jurisdiction. While they did so largely to gain access to Yashiori Island's abundant natural resources and make up for Watatsumi Island's natural deficiencies,[3] Akuou also did so partially for his own ego: He bragged to Mouun and Ayame that he would one day duel against the Great Tengu, Sasayuri, and bring their Tengu mask back as a prize.[1][4][5]
The Watatsumi forces succeeded in conquering and annexing Yashiori Island. Akuou — who had distinguished himself in battle — became its vassal ruler, gaining the title of "Touzannou" (King of the Eastern Mountain) from Orobashi.[2][Note 1] When word reached Narukami Island, Makoto was preoccupied with domestic affairs, so Ei led a force to subjugate the invaders.[6] Sasayuri participated in the war and lost their life in the conflict following a duel against Akuou.
At the end of the war, Akuou was slain alongside Orobashi when Ei punished them with Musou no Hitotachi, splitting Yashiori Island in half and creating Musoujin Gorge in the process.[1][2][7] Mouun was slain by Sasayuri's subordinates and had her body taken away, while Ayame disappeared into the ocean and was never heard of again. Watatsumi Island was thus left in the hands of the Divine Priestess, who had not participated in battle and instead remained on the island.

Legacy[]
Akuou's "Getsumouun" and "Yuushio" sword styles continue to be used by Watatsumi soldiers to this day, and remarkable warriors are known as "scions of Touzannou."[2]
In modern times, "Akuou" has become the more well-known name for him.

Trivia[]
In the Japanese version, early texts pertaining to Akuou from Versions 2.0 and 2.1 wrote his name as 悪王, which is the new form of the 悪 Aku character. In Version 2.2, his name switched to using kyuujitai (traditional character forms) and is now written as 惡王. Previous references to Akuou did not update his name accordingly.
Etymology[]
His original title Touzannou (Japanese: 東山王 "King of the Eastern Mountain[8]") is likely a reference to Chuuzan'ou (Japanese: 中山王 lit. "King of the Middle Mountain"), a royal title held by the Okinawan rulers of the Chuuzan Kingdom (1350–1429) and its successor Ryukyu Kingdom (1429–1872).
The etymology of his later title Akuou (Japanese: 惡王 "Wicked King[8]") is perhaps based on the legends of Akuro'ou (Japanese: 悪路王 lit. "Wicked Road King"), an ancient demonic warrior in the Japanese folklore who fought against the imperial court.
Though scholarly debated, Akuro'ou is popularly identified with the historical figure Aterui (?–802), who is now regarded as a folk hero in Northeast Japan. As the leader of the alliance of the ancient Emishi people, Aterui first won a large battle with the shogun's army of the empire in 789 and continued to resist until his surrender in 802, producing a popular theory that the "Wicked Road King" Akuro'ou in the folklore is the demonized form of Aterui that was named by those who condemned the hero as a savage. This theory may have inspired a story told in the lore of the claymore Akuoumaru.
In real life, the etymology of Akuro'ou is scholarly disputed. Some scholars say the word "aku" is used in the archaic sense of "formidable and disobedient" here (rather than "wicked") to commemorate the valiance and rebellion of the Emishi leader, while other scholars say it originally meant the "King of Akuri," where Akuri is an ancient place name in Northeast Japan.[9] In any case, the game adopted the most popular etymology.
Additionally, Aterui's rebellion was put down by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, the first person to hold the title of Sei-i Taishougun, the official title of the position later known as Shogun and military ruler of all of Japan. Akou similarly was put down by Ei, the Shogun of Inazuma.
Notes[]

↑ The original Chinese text states the Watatsumi people called all of Yashiori Island "Eastern Mountain," and further indicates that they had annexed the whole island. See Debates on the "Viceroy of the East" § Notes for details.
