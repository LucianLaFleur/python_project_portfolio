Dialogue[]

Fariha: Hello. How can I help you?
 And you are...
Fariha: I'm Mr. Nizam's secretary. I'm responsible for taking minutes for him.
Fariha: If you see Mr. Nizam scowling or sighing in frustration, please don't take it personally. That's just how he is.
Fariha: Just make your request in advance and he'll make sure it gets taken care of.
 See you.
Fariha: Take care, now.
