 A bountiful haul...
Media:VO Mora-Grubber 01.ogg "...What a bountiful haul!"

Dialogue[]

Mora-Grubber: Ah, as one would expect of Boss Beidou. Bountiful spoils indeed.
 You seem very pleased.
Mora-Grubber: Of course! Why, we made quite the haul on this voyage!
Mora-Grubber: Contrary to what most people think, fleets usually come back empty-handed.
Mora-Grubber: We're... something of an exception in that this almost never happens to us, which is all thanks to Captain Beidou's brilliant leadership.
 What are your plans after the booty's distributed?
Mora-Grubber: How do I put this? I've always had my eye on the process of making money. Never gave much thought to what to do afterward.
Mora-Grubber: Maybe I'll go get a hundred servings of Zhongyuan Chop Suey and treat everyone... Who knows?
Mora-Grubber: Some people think results are everything. But if you think about it, if living itself is all about results, what does living even mean?
Mora-Grubber: I'd say that if you just look at results, you'll miss out on a lot.
 See you.
Mora-Grubber: Haha, may fortune find you.

Trivia[]
Despite warning the traveler not to rob her during "A Lone Ship In Guyun," nothing will happen if you open the three chests next to her.
