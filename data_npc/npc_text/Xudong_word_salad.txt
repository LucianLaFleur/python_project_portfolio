Profile[]
Xudong hails from Liyue and is a particularly renowned chef; he specializes in recreating popular dishes using cheap, accessible ingredients — and still making it taste nearly identical to the original version.[1] He had a rivalry with Chef Mao, Xiangling's father, and their cook-off ended in a stalemate. He then began traveling across Liyue, then across Teyvat, to look for inspiration and a breakthrough.[2] At some point during his travels, he met Parvaneh and Julie, and they formed the Gourmet Supremos.
After arriving in Inazuma, they were able to get through the Kanjou Commission and leave Ritou. However, their attempts to experiment with local cuisine ground to a halt when they discovered that, without the ability to channel Electro energy, they were unable to collect Sakura Blooms. Shortly thereafter, the Traveler appears before them, and the three enlist the Traveler to help them obtain special ingredients they could not, in exchange for food and recipes.
Over the course of The Gourmet Supremos quests and commissions, the Gourmet Supremos and the Traveler meet Kamei Munehisa. Despite Parvaneh's misgivings about the vagrant former samurai, Xudong decides to hire him out of empathy for Munehisa's food situation.
