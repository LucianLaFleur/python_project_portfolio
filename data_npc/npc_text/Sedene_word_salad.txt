Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Before completing Masquerade of the Guilty.


Sedene: Hello there. If you're lost, please turn back, Some of the rooms here are restricted access only.
 What rooms are there in here?
Sedene: If I were to tell you, you'd get curious, so it might be best if I simply don't.
Sedene: Monsieur Neuvillette's office is just over by the side — this much everyone knows.
Sedene: And, well... Lady Furina lives on the top floor. She's a real celebrity, so she really doesn't have any time slots free.
Sedene: But not to worry, the Maison Gardiennage and the Marechaussee Phantom are also upstairs, so anyone with ill intent will not be getting very far regardless.
 Tell me about Neuvillette...
Sedene: Monsieur Neuvillette's time slots... No, his schedule, is also very full. He can't always be found in his office, in any case.
Sedene: If you have a matter to put before him, please submit an application to the corresponding Gestionnaire, according to the matter at hand.
 Tell me about Lady Furina...
Sedene: There is a special entrance that leads to her suite which isn't accessible from here. If you really wanted to get there, you can try jumping off the roof.
Sedene: Someone did once try to do this. Fortunately, his life didn't wind up in any danger — he is presently hard at work at the Fortress of Meropide.
 Well, I'll be heading back now...
Sedene: Alright. Don't get any ideas, now.

Dialogue Set #2[]
After completing Masquerade of the Guilty.


Sedene: Hello there. If you're lost, please turn back, Some of the rooms here are restricted access only.
 What rooms are there in here?
Sedene: If I were to tell you, you'd get curious, so it might be best if I simply don't.
Sedene: Monsieur Neuvillette's office is just over by the side — this much everyone knows.
Sedene: What else? The Maison Gardiennage and the Marechaussee Phantom are also upstairs, so anyone with ill intent will not be getting very far regardless.
 Tell me about Neuvillette...
(Same as before)
 Tell me about Lady Furina...
Sedene: Are you asking where Lady Furina Lives?
Sedene: She used to have an apartment on the top floor. I remember someone did once try to get in there by jumping off the roof.
Sedene: Fortunately, his life didn't wind up in any danger — he is presently hard at work at the Fortress of Meropide.
Sedene: Anyway, that kind of thing won't happen again. Lady Furina left her official post to pursue a life closer to her desires.
Sedene: She seemed a lot more relaxed last time I saw her, so I don't think you need to worry about her.
 Well, I'll be heading back now...
(Same as before)

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
"Sedene" may be based on Sedna, the ocean goddess in Inuit mythology. She is often depicted as a half-woman, half-fish (or half-seal) figure, similar to the Melusine in European folklore.
