Dialogue[]

Alfry: Hey! Alfry here, from the Adventurers' Guild Intelligence Department.
Alfry: Got any intel you can share with me?
 I'd like to ask about something.
Alfry: Ask away. Helping Guild members is also our duty.
 Tell me about the Adventurers' Guild.
Alfry: Ad astra abyssosque!
Alfry: Roughly speaking, we are a hub for adventurous friends who resolve all kinds of troubles for the people or organizations.
Alfry: We need to put food on the table, of course. So there will be rewards for completing commissions.
Alfry: Katheryne at reception takes care of visitors.
Alfry: Since you're interested, please pay them a visit!
 Tell me about yourself.
Alfry: Me? I'm just an average person.
Alfry: Well... unless knowing everyone in Teyvat is something to talk about.
Alfry: It's not that incredible... The info came mostly from the resources of the Intelligence Department of Adventurers' Guild.
Alfry: I'm also a member of the Intelligence Department. Aside from contacting and guiding, gathering information is also part of my job.
Alfry: We've chatted for so long. I guess I can say we're friends now?
Alfry: Come on, tell me something about you!
 About the Intelligence Department...
Alfry: The Intelligence Department does not take part in commissions most of the time. We help adventurers to complete commissions by providing them with information.
Alfry: In simple terms, our functions can be divided into "collection" and "organization."
Alfry: Our field staff, known as investigators, handle the collection of information. An example is Fischl — she is an exceptional investigator.
Alfry: Others, like me, remain at the back-end and organize the information we have collected, before providing it to adventurers.
Alfry: So you can say that the success of adventurers and the Intelligence Division's work are joined at the hip.
 Have you ever met someone who looks like me?
Alfry: I know about you. You're the outlander who's just arrived in Mondstadt, right? I've had my eye on you since your arrival.
Alfry: So you mean to say that there is another person like you? Another traveler from a faraway land?
Alfry: ...How strange. To think that there were people in Teyvat who I had no knowledge of...
 Goodbye.
Alfry: Oh, you don't need my help?
