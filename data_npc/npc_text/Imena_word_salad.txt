 If you're lucky...
Media:VO Imena 01.ogg "The food in the cafeteria is excellent, if you're lucky enough to make it in."

Dialogue[]

Imena: The documents have been very clearly organized. I won't need to do anymore I think.
 What sorts of documents?
Imena: Ah, it's some communications between the Fortress of Meropide and the Palais Mermonia. I'm in charge of sorting them out before handing them over to the Chief Justice.
Imena: To be honest, the documents from the Fortress have always been perfect. I just need to go down, come back up, and hand them in.
Imena Sometimes I can even get a nice meal at the Coupon Cafeteria over there — no wonder a retired senior of mine said that you couldn't go wrong with this job.
 See you.
Imena: See you. I hope everything goes well with you too.
