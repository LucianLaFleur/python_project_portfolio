Focalors was the God of Justice and the former Hydro Archon among The Seven who presided over Fontaine. She is the successor of Egeria, and was originally one of Egeria's Oceanid familiars.
As of Archon Quest Chapter IV: Act V - Masquerade of the Guilty, she was sentenced to death by the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale and willingly gave up her full elemental authority to Neuvillette. This sentence exacted by the Oratrice also effectively abolished the Divine Throne of the Hydro Archon altogether, making Focalors the last Hydro Archon.
Once one with the being known as Furina, she separated her "divinity" from this singular body to exist separately as Focalors, with the remaining "humanity" made into Furina. After her death, Furina now continues to live autonomously as an ordinary human.

Introduction[]
My ideals have no stains.I must correct you. People here bear no sins in the eyes of the gods... Only laws and the Tribunal can judge someone.They can judge even me. So praise my magnificence and purity.—Focalors, Varunada Lazurite Gemstone
Appearance[]
Focalors is a fair-skinned woman with heterochromic eyes, her right eye being light blue and her left eye dark blue. Like Furina, her hair is of a whitish-blue tinge with light blue streaks, and is divided into two parts: a short bell-shaped bob that goes to her neck, and two longer strands of hair that go down to her waist.
Focalors wears a white dress with puffy long sleeves and gold accents, that fades to a dark shade of blue with starry details towards the hems and ends of her sleeves. The bodice of her dress is dark blue fading to white, with gold accents and trims; the center exposes portions of her chest and stomach, and is fastened by gold and blue metal details. She is barefoot, and wears a gold ankle cuff with a blue jewel on her right ankle that connects to a toe ring. Her fingernails and toenails are painted with light blue nail polish.

Personality[]
Because Focalors and Furina are two aspects of a once singular being, their personality and interests are similar. She shares Furina's passion for drama and her fascination with grand displays of human emotion, but does not display any of Furina's emotional outbursts as those stem from her humanity that now resides entirely within Furina.
Due to her lack of humanity, Focalors has a rather blunt way of speaking, as seen by her nonchalance when revealing that she cursed Furina or the numerous times she laughed mentioning her upcoming sacrifice. Despite this, she appears to genuinely love her human counterpart, Furina, claiming that being human has always been her biggest dream. After her death, she leaves a last message of thanks to Furina and asks her to live happily as a human just as Focalors wished for both of them.
One of the main traits in Focalors is her intelligence. She came up with an extremely complex and ingenious plan to deceive the Heavenly Principles, thus destroying the Hydro Archon's divine throne, returning the elemental authority to the Water Dragon, and saving the people of Fontaine from the Prophecy. According to herself, this was the reason why Egeria chose her as her successor for the position of the Hydro Archon.
Like Furina, Focalors was also extremely selfless and had a strong sense of justice. She was willing to sacrifice both her divinity and her humanity to ensure that Fontaine's people wouldn't be "dissolved" as the levels of the Primordial Sea rose. Additionally, pointing out the hypocrisy of the Heavenly Principles in branding Egeria and the Fontainians with the "Sin" for having used the water of the Primordial Sea without permission, declaring them guilty of stealing the elemental authority of the Seven Sovereigns. Her plan's end undid this "injustice" by returning Hydro authority to Neuvillette.
In her final moments, a more vulnerable side of her is shown, as she admits that she is afraid of dying, stating that she believes this is one thing that both humans and gods have in common.

Story[]
History[]
Egeria, the previous Hydro Archon, was slain during the cataclysm,[6] and Focalors was instated in her place as the Hydro Archon sometime afterward. Focalors herself was also an Oceanid transformed into a human by Egeria, who Egeria had chosen to be her successor in the hopes that she would figure out a solution to the prophecy. The Oceanids, including the strongest among them, Rhodeia of Loch, did not recognize Focalors as the new Hydro Archon,[7] with Idyia noting that around the same time as her ascension, the very waters of Fontaine became filled with pain and hatred.[8] This change, in addition to their discovery of what remained of their former god at the Harvisptokhm,[9] led the Oceanids to exile themselves from Fontaine and cut all ties.
After she ascended, Focalors spent a long time on the ocean floor, devising a plan to subvert the prophecy. Eventually, she concluded that she needed to deceive the Heavenly Principles into thinking the prophecy was happening while actually saving all Fontainians. To this end, Focalors separated her divinity from her body and spirit, and named her human body that she left behind "Furina." Focalors saw Furina as essentially a human version of herself as well as exactly the kind of human she wished to be. Focalors placed a curse upon Furina, making her immortal as long as her divinity existed, but also preventing her from pursuing her own happiness. She had Furina deceive the people of Fontaine and the Heavenly Principles, pretending to be the Hydro Archon day in and day out for 500 years. If Furina ever allowed her true identity as an impostor of the Hydro Archon to be revealed, Focalors' plan would fail and the prophecy would doom her people.
Meanwhile, Focalors kept her Gnosis in her divine half and hid inside the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, accumulating Indemnitium in the device. When the time came, she planned to use the accumulated energy to not only kill herself but destroy the Hydro Archon's divine throne, returning the stolen Hydro Authority to the Hydro Dragon. To that end, Focalors had a letter sent to Neuvillette, the current incarnation of the Hydro Dragon, inviting him to assume the position of Fontaine's Chief Justice. She hoped that he would come to sympathize with humanity, so that when the time came for Focalors to return Neuvillette's stolen Authority, he would be willing to use his regained powers to turn the people of Fontaine into true humans, saving them from the prophecy.

Archon Quests[]
The current Seven are all briefly mentioned in the Archon Quest Downtown in Chapter I: Act II - Farewell, Archaic Lord while Zhongli is inspecting the kites that represent them. Of the God of Justice's kite, he says "Justice flows across the surface of the waters."
In the Archon Quest A Toast to Victory in Chapter III: Act V - Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises, Nahida mentions that while Focalors doesn't directly preside over trials, she is still present and has the right to influence the final verdict. Focalors created the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, which was designed and meant to help the Iudex, Neuvillette, carry out sentences. 
During Lyney's first show at the Opera Epiclese, he went to investigate the Oratrice under the guise of performing a magic trick. While in the room where the Oratrice's core was held, Lyney heard a voice, which caused him to retreat. He confessed this fact to the Traveler during his trial for murder,[10] who would later pass on the information to Neuvillette.[11] Unbeknownst to any of the parties involved, this voice was Focalors'.
Following Childe's disappearance in the Fortress of Meropide, Arlecchino decided to investigate Furina, eventually running into her by pure chance while she was trying to play with a cat, using the opportunity to attack and try to steal her Gnosis. She did not find the Gnosis on her, while Furina was left shocked and begged for mercy. Arlecchino felt a "curse" of some sort emanating from her, her genuine fear of death and eccentric behavior unfitting for an Archon. Arlecchino left without threatening any further harm, realizing that she was not Focalors and that the Gnosis was being held somewhere else.[12]
Eventually, Focalors would be put on trial for the "original sin" that the Heavenly Principles had declared on Egeria. The Traveler and Neuvillette would eventually realize that Furina was a fraud, managing to put her on trial in an attempt to make her reveal her secrets as to avoid the prophecy. Now revealing her true identity, Focalors appeared to Neuvillette and admitted to having Furina take her place as the Hydro Archon for the past 500 years in order to successfully deceive the Heavenly Principles. She then reveals her plan to end herself at the hands of the Oratrice, thus returning her elemental authority to its rightful owner, Neuvillette, both out of guilt from acquiring his stolen power, and knowing that only him at his full dragonhood and the experiences he had with the people, would be able to save them from the prophecy. Having acquired enough Indemnitium to carry out her sentence, she proceeded to execute herself. Her Gnosis was returned to Neuvillette with his full Authority restored, he proceeded to absolve Fontanians of their sin, preventing them from dissolving, though any that dissolved prior to her sacrifice would not be returned. This self-sacrifice also shattered her Archon throne, resulting in six Archons remaining.[13]

For instance, "it is forbidden to release any flying objects during the first three days of each month," "during the dry season, all bivalves that wash ashore belong to the Hydro Archon, while other mollusks belong to the people," "no domestic pets shall be named after Furina," "tomato ketchup is to be consumed in restaurants only as a condiment, never on its own," and, finally, "Melusines are to be addressed using she/her pronouns, never the impersonal it/its"... That last one was my personal contribution.
Trivia[]
In The Lesser Key of Solomon, "Focalor" is a Great Duke of Hell and the 41st demon, having thirty legions of demons under his command. According to the grimoire, Focalor has power over the wind and the sea, can cause death by drowning and save those about to perish in a watery grave. His hope was to return to Heaven after a thousand years, but he was deceived.
In English voice-overs, her name is pronounced with an approximation of the French pronunciation of the French localization Foçalors (/ˈfoʊsəlɔɹ/, "FOH-sə-lor") instead of the expected Latin-based reading (/ˈfoʊkəlɔɹz/, "FOH-kə-lorz") of "Focalors" seen in Chinese, Japanese or Korean.
Focalors is depicted wielding an elongated straight sword on Fontaine's Statue of The Seven.
Focalors is the second Archon not to use their own human vessels as their own bodies, the first being Ei, who now lacks of a human vessel.
