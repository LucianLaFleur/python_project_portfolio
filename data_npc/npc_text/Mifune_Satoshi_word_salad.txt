Story[]
Little is known about Satoshi's life or history. However, it can be assumed that he was part of the Iwakura Clan while Iwakura Mitsunari was its clan successor. When the Vision Hunt Decree was enacted, Mitsunari had his Vision taken and decided to join the Shogunate forces.[1] Many of the other clan members saw this as a betrayal of their clan's pursuit of righteousness and deserted him, either going rogue or choosing to fight against the Shogunate instead. Based on Satoshi's dialogue, he was among the latter, and appeared to be the only one of the five practitioners to do so.
He eventually hid from the Shogunate by lurking in the ruins beneath Araumi. It is unknown how he managed to access the area, as the Traveler was only able to enter Araumi with the help of the Memento Lens.
When the Traveler encounters him in Araumi, Satoshi assumes them to be with the Shogunate and attempts to kill them. The Traveler is left with no choice but to kill him in self-defense. After receiving word that a Traveler has been going around killing Iwakura Clan members, two expelled members, Okazaki Toraemon and Yanagiha Arashi, discover Mifune's corpse and collect his sword to create a memorial.[2][3]
