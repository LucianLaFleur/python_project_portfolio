Aralohita is a historical figure of the Aranara, who accompanied Pir Kavikavus when he was alive.[1]
After Pir Kavikavus went missing and presumably dead after a mysterious accident, Aralohita saved some of his research and locked it behind riddles and puzzles, which the Aranara had been fond of. Aralohita's own fate is unknown, but Ararycan was able to locate their last known location and unearth Pir Kavikavus's research papers.[1]
It is speculated that Aralohita was one of the factors that helped Pir Kavikavus achieve many achievements at a very young age.
