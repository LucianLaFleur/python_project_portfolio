Dialogue[]

Santallier: Actually... I've mentioned this to the higher-ups, that this area doesn't need to be patrolled.
Ophelia: I think that's reasonable.
Santallier: I mean, this is the safest block in the area, and the Champion Duelists have their office right over there.
Ophelia: Exactly.
Santallier: I didn't expect them to say "only you can take up the grand task of patrolling this area."
Ophelia: Seriously, did they...
Santallier: Well... I've heard everyone say that you're a brilliant adventurer.
Santallier: Guess we're pretty similar in how people have pinned their hopes on us, huh?
Santallier: Wanna go get a drink after work — y'know, from one person with a similar fate to another?
Ophelia: No, I'm afraid adventurers are never "off work."
