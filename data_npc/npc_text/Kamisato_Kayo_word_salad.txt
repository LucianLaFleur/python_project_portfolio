Kamisato Kayo  (Japanese: 神里華代) is the deceased mother of Kamisato Ayato and Kamisato Ayaka of the Kamisato Clan. She died when Ayaka was young, which prompted Ayaka to mature faster and be more involved in the clan's affairs.
Kamisato Kayo's diary and her alias, Tsubaki, are prominent parts of Kamisato Ayaka's Story Quest, Grus Nivis Chapter Act I: The Whispers of the Crane and the White Rabbit.

Profile[]
While she was alive, Kamisato Kayo took on the alter-ego of Tsubaki to dream about what life would be like if she was unburdened by the responsibilities of the Kamisato Clan and was simply an ordinary woman. As Tsubaki, she liked pretty kimonos, wished to try food from different places, and yearned to see sights she had never seen before. However, as someone of her position, she could not indulge in these ordinary things, nor could she visit a local Inazuman festival as she wanted to.
Ayaka empathized with her mother upon discovering her alter-ego, as she also felt burdened by her responsibilities and was happiest when she could live life like a normal person. Ayaka would later attend a festival to fulfill both her own and her mother's wish.

Widely known as one of the most distinguished clans in all of Inazuma, it is the branch of the Tri-Commission that manages ceremonial and cultural affairs. Since my parents passed, Brother and I assumed responsibility for all clan matters, big and small.More About Kamisato Ayaka: IV Media:VO_Kamisato Ayaka More About Kamisato Ayaka - 04.ogg Media:VO ZH_Kamisato Ayaka More About Kamisato Ayaka - 04.ogg Media:VO JA_Kamisato Ayaka More About Kamisato Ayaka - 04.ogg Media:VO KO_Kamisato Ayaka More About Kamisato Ayaka - 04.ogg My mother was the most incredible person. She was always so dignified and elegant, always smiling, no matter what situation she might be facing. She had so much to deal with in the clan on so many levels, but she took it all in stride — it was like nothing could ever faze her. Everything about her was perfect, and I say that without exaggerating. *sigh* But the moment she passed away, I realized... I couldn't hide behind my mother any longer. I wasn't little Ayaka any more.Kamisato AyatoWhen Thunder Strikes Media:VO_Kamisato Ayato When Thunder Strikes.ogg Media:VO ZH_Kamisato Ayato When Thunder Strikes.ogg Media:VO JA_Kamisato Ayato When Thunder Strikes.ogg Media:VO KO_Kamisato Ayato When Thunder Strikes.ogg Ayaka was always scared of thunder as a child — until one day, mother told her that the sound of thunder is the voice of the Almighty Shogun. After that, she would start focusing intensely every time she heard the sound of thunder, as if by concentrating hard enough, she'd be able to hear exactly what Her Excellency was saying.
