Dialogue[]

Yasuda: Hello there, would you like to take a stroll with me?
 May I ask your name?
Yasuda: Haha, ah, I'm just an ordinary elderly person.
Yasuda: After retiring from the Tenryou Commission, I don't really have much to do. I come out and walk around every day to listen to the birds, to feed the cats and dogs, and to look at the view.
Yasuda: I was always busy when I was young. I never knew that Inazuma had such beautiful cherry blossoms, or that the creeks here were so clear and wonderful...
Yasuda: We age, but the world remains. So all I want to do now is enjoy the rest of the life I have left.
 Won't you get tired of it if you look at it every day?
Yasuda: *sigh* This is the part that young people like you wouldn't understand. Though the scenery around here never changes, the people and the things related to it do. It's very interesting if you pay attention to those changes.
Yasuda: I once met a young man wearing a maple-red shirt who had the ability to read the weather. The clothes that I hung out to dry would've gotten wet if he hadn't told me about the rain.
Yasuda: And if you think about it, if I wasn't out and about like this, I wouldn't have met an outstanding outlander like yourself either. Am I right? Haha!
 Take it easy, sir. Goodbye.
Yasuda: Alright, I'll see you again.
