Chang the Ninth's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Chang the Ninth is the ninth-born child[1] to the once-prestigious Chang family, which owns a mining business.[2] As a child, Chang lived in Qingce Village, where he met Little Nine.[3] Because the two were ninth-born children in their families, Little Nine felt a certain camaraderie with "Big Nine" and often pestered him to read her stories.[1] While he started many stories for her to read, he never finished them, and told himself he would complete them when he had more time. One day, she disappeared without a trace; Chang suspected her parents, who had always held him in disdain, had quietly left Qingce Village to separate them.[3] He began writing First Apprentice of Guhua as a submission for the Yae Publishing House annual contest "This Novel is Amazing!" in hopes that it would win, he would become famous, and she would reconnect with him this way.[4] He is unaware that Little Nine actually died long ago — ironically, from dropping a book he wrote for her in the river and likely dying of hypothermia after trying to salvage it.[1]
For a time, he resided in Liyue Harbor and became a regular customer of Wanwen Bookhouse. However, after the Chasm closed recently, the family business languished and Chang moved back to Qingce Village.[3][5] To recoup his company's losses, Chang pawned off most of his beloved book collection, with the exception of the rare book Legend of the Shattered Halberd (VI).[2]
As part of a Cor Lapis procurement deal with the Fatui, Gentry Maocai sends his servant Changhu to force Chang into selling his Cor Lapis at 30% of the market price. Shortly before one of Changhu's visits, the Traveler and Paimon approach Chang in search of Teyvat Travel Guide - Liyue, while Xingqiu accompanied them in hopes of finding the elusive Legend of the Shattered Halberd volume. After learning of Chang's plight, and as repayment for allowing him to read the volume, Xingqiu enacts a plan that successfully puts an end to Maocai's harassment and allows Chang to sell his Cor Lapis at full price. With the profit he made from the deal, Chang is able to buy back his book collection.
In Inazuma, the Traveler learns that Chang's book, First Apprentice of Guhua, has been fairly popular in Inazuma despite the relatively dated themes and plot of the book, and Kuroda, Chief Editor of the Yae Publishing House, reveals in his dialogue that Chang did win the competition. Because of the Sakoku Decree, however, the Yae Publishing House has been unable to send him his royalties. Aratani sends the Traveler to deliver presents and invitations to Chang and "Zhenyu" — Xingqiu's penname when he wrote A Legend of Sword — to visit the Yae Publishing House in-person and serve as judges for "This Novel is Amazing!"[6]

Dialogue[]

(Before completing Bookworm Swordsman)
Chang the Ninth: If you're here to make fun of an old man, you picked the wrong one. I don't take any nonsense.
 Who are you?
Chang the Ninth: Not to scare you off, but I'm none other than the once-illustrious Chang the Ninth of Feiyun Slope!
Chang the Ninth: Back in Liyue, in the good old days, so many Mora went through my hands every day that I couldn't give you an exact number. Anyone who wanted to do business knew it was me they had to impress!
Chang the Ninth: Hmph, even those big-shot Liyue Qixing would have to move aside if I told them they were in my way!
 So... why did you move here to live as a hermit?
Chang the Ninth: It was a somewhat... unexpected turn of events. The business started going downhill, so I thought I'd sell the old abode and move out here, where it's peaceful and quiet, to get away from it all.
Chang the Ninth: The ancients had a saying, "He who has not known poverty has yet to become a true man." I might only have this hut and my book collection to my name, but I'm optimistic that my time will come again sooner or later.
Chang the Ninth: I'm wondering about the mineral trade, maybe... Well, I shan't say any more or I'd be handing you a business opportunity on a silver platter!
Chang the Ninth: But when my time comes, everyone in Liyue Harbor is going to know that old Chang the Ninth is finally back again!
 Do you get on with your neighbors?
Chang the Ninth: You mean those penniless peasants? Ugh, the fact I even have to live near them...
Chang the Ninth: I may be their neighbor now — only due to circumstance I might add — but ohh you mark my words, when I have restored my business to its rightful place in the world, they won't even be worthy to farm the ground I walk upon!
 Goodbye.
Chang the Ninth: Hmph. If you've no serious business here then take your idle chatter elsewhere.
(After completing Bookworm Swordsman)
Chang the Ninth: What wind has brought you today? Please, come in, come in.
 Have we met?
Chang the Ninth: You don't remember me? It's me, Chang the Ninth! You once bought a mountain of Cor Lapis from me!
Chang the Ninth: I imagine you've met a great many people, it's to be expected that you wouldn't remember...
Chang the Ninth: I remember when I used to do my business on Feiyun Slope. People would fight to do business with me... *sigh* Not like now...
 So what happened?
Chang the Ninth: Thanks to you, I was able to sell that Cor Lapis at a good price. You effectively saved my life in the process.
Chang the Ninth: I know my gut feeling won't lead me astray. Sure, I've had a few business deals go south, but that which makes money will make money.
Chang the Ninth: Just watch, I used that money to buy more ore. Once my ore business really gets going, I can finally get out of this dump.
Chang the Ninth: But when my time comes, everyone in Liyue Harbor is going to know that old Chang the Ninth is finally back again!
 About Xingqiu...
Chang the Ninth: Oh yeah, that Guhua kid... Haven't seen him since that day. Getting up to something inexplicable no doubt...
Chang the Ninth: But don't you find it odd? Surely his story isn't as simple as that...
Chang the Ninth: Forget it, it's got nothing to do with me.
 How are the neighbors?
Chang the Ninth: You mean those penniless peasants? Ugh, the fact I even have to live near them...
Chang the Ninth: I may be their neighbor now — only due to circumstance I might add — but ohh you mark my words, when I have restored my business to its rightful place in the world, they won't even be worthy to farm the ground I walk upon!
 Best of luck.
Chang the Ninth: Haha, I'll take your well-wishes to heart!
Chang the Ninth: Truth be told, I really owe you for helping me so much last time.
Chang the Ninth: Here, you can have these Noctilucous Jades. They're not expensive by any means, but do take them as a keepsake.
(Obtain  Noctilucous Jade ×4)
 We're gonna get going.
Chang the Ninth: Earth be solid beneath your feet. We will meet again in Liyue in due time.
