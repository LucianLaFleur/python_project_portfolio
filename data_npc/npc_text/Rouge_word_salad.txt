Profile[]
Rouge is the codename for a vigilante who works with his followers, Blanc and Bleu, to target unscrupulous Treasure Hoarders and enact his brand of justice on them, beating them up and taking their ill-gained spoils to redistribute to the poor and unfortunate. Rouge alludes to his discontentment with the Maison Gardiennage, but remarks that they are still on the side of justice in the end.[1]
While detested by his victims, Rouge is well-respected by most, and Don Quijano describes him as an "outstanding young man." He taught Penny, and both of them later teach Paimon and the Traveler, to "listen with your head, not your ears, to truly get what others are saying." This skill works not only on humans, but animals as well, which is how both he and Penny manage to communicate with Don Quijano and Nana.[2]

Appearance[]
Rouge is a young man with short red hair. He wears two outfits during Impromptu Poem of the Crimson Dawn: He initially appears in a blue vest, white shirt, and black trousers, but later changes it out for a red jacket, black shirt, and beige trousers.

History[]
Rouge once adventured with Freeman and the cat Don Quijano, only for three hitmen to target them and chase them all the way to Poisson.[2]
He was also friends with Barrow and Parker, Penny's parents, and took on the responsibility of caring for the girl after her parents decided their wanderlust would not be suitable for raising a child.[3] Rouge himself left her in the care of Don Quijano and Nana, Autumn's dog, and visits her occasionally.[2]

Present Day[]
During Impromptu Poem of the Crimson Dawn, Paimon and the Traveler find Rouge locked up in a cage by some Treasure Hoarders.
