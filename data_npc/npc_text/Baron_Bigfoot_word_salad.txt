Profile[]
Baron Bigfoot is a retired[1] seasoned member of the Adventurers' Guild. As a result of his adventures in Dragonspine,[2] which he greatly enjoyed, he earned the moniker of "Bigfoot."
He entered the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament during the events of Fabulous Fungus Frenzy and trained a team of Fungi centered around a Whirling Cryo Fungus, "Gusto-Frosto." He won two rounds but lost to the Traveler and their Floating Hydro Fungus, "Bongo-Head." After reflecting on the experience, Baron Bigfoot used his savings to purchase a film of the competition and a film player, and he agreed to host regular watch parties for free for anyone interested.[1]

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available after completing Nilotpala Cup: Debut Match


(Talk to Baron Bigfoot near the Coruscating Potential stall)
Baron Bigfoot: Hmm, these potions really are capable of bring out the Cryo powers of the Fungi.
 Cryo?
Baron Bigfoot: Yeah. When I was younger, I traveled to Mondstadt and loved working in the cold. My peers called me the "Bigfoot."
Baron Bigfoot: Now that I've joined the competition, it would only be right that I carry on my old habits.
Baron Bigfoot: And that's why my Fungus team will be centered around Gusto-Frosto to maximize the Cryo effects.
Paimon: Why would you tell us all about your Fungi? What if we get matched against each other?
Baron Bigfoot: Using extra information to secure victory is a useful tactic, but it's not my style.
Baron Bigfoot: After all, this is just a competition--not some kind of cutthroat battle. Fairness is very important to me, so it wouldn't make a difference if I told you.
 Goodbye.
Baron Bigfoot: Maybe we'll see each other again in the arena.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after defeating Souka in Dual Missions: Progress and Probe!


(Talk to Baron Bigfoot near the Special Training Domain)
Baron Bigfoot: Not bad, it's a good place to toughen up.
 Toughen up?
Baron Bigfoot: Experiencing hardships together is the way to become stronger with your Fungi.
Baron Bigfoot: I joined the parties of many adventurers when I was young. We traveled the world and completed a good number of commissions from the association.
Baron Bigfoot: Having experienced countless dangers and challenges, we became stronger at an unbelievable speed. The same philosophy applies to Fungi as well.
Baron Bigfoot: The organizers picked a perfect place to train and toughen up the Fungi.
Baron Bigfoot: We don't know where the enemies here are from... but that's not something we competitors need to know.
Paimon: Hmm, this guy really has it all figured out. Not only is he thorough, he's really passionate as well!
 Sorry to bother you...
Baron Bigfoot: It's not a problem at all. We're all competitors here. It's nice to get to know one another.

Dialogue Set #3[]
Available after defeating him in Dual Missions: Progress and Probe!


(Talk to Baron Bigfoot near the stage)
Baron Bigfoot: Hey, it's you guys. Thanks for what you did before.
 Why?
Baron Bigfoot: You showed me what I was lacking. I still have a lot of training ahead of me.
Baron Bigfoot: I seem to have been too focused on a single element when it comes to my Fungi. Although your Fungi are also centered around a particular one that's stronger than the rest, your composition is a lot more balanced than mine.
Baron Bigfoot: In other words, the talent that you guys possess is much more balanced and stable than mine. I still have a lot to learn.
Paimon: You're being too modest! You and Gusto-Frosto are great too!
 You're welcome, see ya!
Baron Bigfoot: See you around. I hope to chat again soon!

Dialogue Set #4[]
Available after defeating Layla in Unfathomable Defenses


(Talk to Baron Bigfoot near the Special Training Domain)
Baron Bigfoot: Golden Comet, and Silver Companion, congratulations on making it to the finals.
 Thanks!
Baron Bigfoot: After watching your match against Layla, I feel that the two of you have a special bond with the Fungi.
Baron Bigfoot: You seem to... view the Fungi under the control of the orb... as friends. That's why you're able to understand them better and bring out their full potential.
Baron Bigfoot: In comparison, I still have the idea that I'm their "master." All I could think of was to train with them to better our techniques. I've failed at giving them the care that they needed.
Baron Bigfoot: The gap between me and my Fungi is probably the reason I lost to you. I lost, and for good reason.
Paimon: Please, Brown... erm... Baron Bigfoot! It's not that you were being too hard on your Fungi, it's just that you were treating them in an ordinary way.
Paimon: Besides, we might actually pick up a thing or two from you. Like going on adventures with the Fungi, or putting ourselves in a dire situation to make our bond a little more... resilient!
Baron Bigfoot: That's very nice of you to say, Silver Companion! There is no end to honing one's skills. I still have much to learn...
Baron Bigfoot: Hopefully, after you've claimed the championship, I'll have the honor of going up against you again in the future.
 Wait for our good news.
Paimon: We'll be waiting on yours as well.
 We need to go and start preparing.
Baron Bigfoot: Formidable opponents await! You have to keep your eyes peeled. You guys are the best candidates to be champions in my book!
