Profile[]
Yan'er is a childhood friend of Hiromi and Shun, often being referred to as "Big Sis" by them. They used to hang out at Uyuu Restaurant together before the Sakoku Decree took effect, upon which she and Shun went treasure hunting in Liyue, while Hiromi ended up as a Shogunate soldier, much to both of their disgust.
The Traveler would later encounter her in some ruins south of Wuwang Hill where she addressed herself as a researcher studying Qingce Village and told them about the legend of "Chi."[1] Believing treasure to be found there, she directed her Treasure Hoarders to investigate and pilfer any treasure they could find, but their attempts were unsuccessful due to the presence of Ruin Machines inside. She told the Traveler of her discoveries, where they were able to defeat the automatons and claimed the treasure for themselves, much to her irritation.
Sometime after this, she cooperated with Raptor in an attempt to pilfer treasures from the Abyss Order. They even hired the Grand Thief to help, although he was killed and no treasures were found.[2]
After the coordinated heist, Yan'er and Shun were pursued by Sun Yu and Little Que'er. While they managed to avoid the Guhua disciples, Yan'er was separated from Shun and fell into a pit, where Mountain Shaper arrived and encased her in amber both to protect her from being injured by the fall and to punish her for trespassing.[3] Hiromi, wishing to learn of her whereabouts, asked the Traveler to help look for her. The Traveler found her in a pit at Mt. Hulao, encased in amber and freed her. She feigned ignorance about knowing Hiromi, but promised to meet him at Uyuu Restaurant when she had the time.
