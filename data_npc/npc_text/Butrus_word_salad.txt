Dialogue[]

Butrus: My fish have good meat! Kittens eat them and meow in happiness!
 Have some fish.
Butrus: Take your pick! All fresh!
(Opens Shop menu)
 Your fish...
Butrus: Caught and sold on the same day! Fresh fish! Pay purely for the weight, no tricks!
Butrus: Look at these fish and shrimp! All fat and fresh! Press on them and they bounce back, probably with enough force to push you into the sea!
Butrus: I'd have gotten a full scholarship if the Akademiya opened a fishing school. If they graded on freshness, I'd be awarded all of the degrees.
 Sounds a bit exaggerated.
Butrus: Exaggerated? No, no, no!
Butrus: I've been selling fish here my whole life. If I were a guy who exaggerates, I would've been shunned by customers and lost my business long ago.
Butrus: I know you won't believe me without trying it. Here, take some and have a taste! It's on the house!
Butrus: If you think they're good, then come back often.
(Obtain  Fish ×4)
 Your cats...
Butrus: Uh, are they my cats? I don't think so...
Butrus: I don't know where they came from either. Since I fed one, they've been coming to me one after another, bringing their families with them to have meals.
Butrus: I can't help it either. The kittens are too cute, and I just can't stop my hand from feeding them fish!
Butrus: There are even cats that came running from the inn owner's home, and they wouldn't leave. There, those two on the side.
Butrus: But you know, they can't be blamed. I heard that their owner is going senile, and the cats are tired of hearing his rambling.
 See you.
Butrus: Goodbye, please come again!
