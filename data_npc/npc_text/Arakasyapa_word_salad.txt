Profile[]
Arakasyapa is an Aranara that Kaveh's father taught how to read and write in human script when he was a child. Arakasyapa attempted to repay the favor by intervening in the Interdarshan Champion and hiding the Diadem of Knowledge in a hollowed out tree hole, leaving a note behind explaining that it wishes to protect him. It vanished after performing this action, and presumably hasn't been seen since, based on its absence and lack of mention in previous Aranara quests.
