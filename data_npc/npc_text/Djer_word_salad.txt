Dialogue[]

Djer: Hmm? Were you asking me about my thoughts?
Djer: Well, I was saying that the Temple of Silence has always been an organization that manages knowledge and that seals things related to dangerous knowledge into the form of Revelatory Monuments.
Djer: The "six cardinal sins," which you might've heard of, is a related concept. After all, the Temple and the Akademiya cooperated once upon a time.
Djer: Knowledge is a mysterious thing. It can bring one riches and hope, but misfortune as well.
Djer: Though now, I feel like the sealing work's just not in a good spot.
Djer: The awful weather here in the deserts makes big rituals a tiring, time-consuming process by default, never mind when the weather turns really ugly.
Djer: ...Our ancestors must have had some special method — one I sure hope they've passed down.

Trivia[]
Djer is considered the third pharaoh of the First Dynasty of ancient Egypt in current Egyptology.
