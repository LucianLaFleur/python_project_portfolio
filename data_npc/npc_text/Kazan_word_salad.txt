Dialogue[]

Kazan: *sigh* What I'd do for someone to teach me how to talk to children...
 Did they get up to something again?
Kazan: No, no. That would be an overstatement.
Kazan: Here's the situation. I'm in charge of guarding the lowest White Lift — we use it to draw water — and ensuring the safety of our water source.
Kazan: Everyone in Aaru Village knows the importance of maintaining a steady supply of water in the desert. No one can be allowed to mess with it.
Kazan: But the children can be quite playful, and they sometimes throw pebbles into the water or skim stones across it.
Kazan: They'll say something like "I won't do it again," or "I'll be careful next time," but they'll be back in a few days as if they've forgotten all about their promise...
 Well, I can go and...
Kazan: Uh, no, that's fine.
Kazan: I don't have much to do around here, anyway, so it's really not too much trouble having to remind them every once in a while.
Kazan: And recently, it seems that they've changed their tack. Sometimes, they'll shout, "Stop the elevator! Stop the elevator! This is not a drill!" and come rushing at me.
Kazan: Hold on... That seems even more problematic...
 Well, best of luck to you.
Kazan: *sigh*
