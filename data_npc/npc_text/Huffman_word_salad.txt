Profile[]
Huffman is the older brother of Mika and has been working as member of the Knights of Favonius for at least three years.[3][4] As a member of the Knights of Favonius, his responsibilities includes conducting safety patrols and restocking and dispensing medication together with Swan.[5] He has previously interacted with Alice, Klee's mother, before she left Mondstadt and scolded both of them for causing trouble.
Aside from being a knight, Huffman is also a member of Barbara Fan Club and has received an autograph from Barbara because of his professional personality compared to other fans.

Appearance[]
Huffman wears one of the standard uniforms of the Knights of Favonius. The uniform consists of a black long-sleeve shirt, horse riding pants, gloves, and brown leather shoulder pads with brass-accented white plate armor worn on top. His vambraces however are black. Wing motifs decorate various parts of the armor along with the Knights of Favonius crest on the breastplate. A sheathed sword hangs from his belt on his left side and a blowing horn hangs from the back of his hip.

Dialogue[]

Huffman: Good day, Knights of Favonius at your service.
 About Stormterror...
(After completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
Huffman: Please, do not worry. The Knights of Favonius will do their utmost to protect Mondstadt!
Huffman: This is not rhetoric from the Knights of Favonius Handbook, but something I truly wanted to say myself.
Huffman: Even though Grand Master Varka is not currently in Mondstadt, our Acting Grand Master will surely bring us through this crisis.
 Tell me about the Knights of Favonius.
Huffman: Since I don't want to take up your time touring Mondstadt, I'll make it short.
Huffman: The Knights of Favonius are the protectors of Mondstadt, the swords and shields of this city.
Huffman: ...So you'd like to know how we're doing lately?
Huffman: Thank you for your concern. Me and my outstanding colleagues are protecting our beloved people, as usual.
 Tell me about Mondstadt.
Huffman: It's a city adored by its archon and its people, which is the reason for the Knights of Favonius' existence.
Huffman: Well, that's all. Our belief is short an simple, but strong. Isn't it?
 Goodbye.
Huffman: Goodbye. Enjoy the wind of Mondstadt.
(After completing A Long Shot)
Huffman: Oh, it's you. I salute you, Honorary Knight.
Huffman: How may I be of service to you?
 About Stormterror...
Huffman: Though the end of this crisis is a good thing, it's come with its fair share of troubles, too.
Huffman: Between tallying up the human cost, repairing damaged property and strengthening our defenses in case anyone tries to make trouble, we've got a busy time ahead of us.
Huffman: During this time, we must all do our best to share the Acting Grand Master's burden.
 Tell me about the Knights of Favonius.
Huffman: ...So you'd like to know how we're doing lately?
Huffman: Your concern is much appreciated. Thanks to you both, we've managed to solve many difficult problems.
Huffman: I'm just glad that we've never let down the trust of the citizens of Mondstadt.
Huffman: Me and my outstanding colleagues will continue protecting our beloved people, as usual.
 Tell me about Mondstadt.
(Same as before)
 Goodbye.
(Same as before)

Event Dialogue[]
Of Ballads and Brews[]

(New option after normal introduction dialogue)
 About Mika...
(After completing Sounds From Afar)
Huffman: Oh? You've already met my brother? Then I don't think there's much to say.
Huffman: I was so worried about him when he went out with the Grand Master. But now it seems I was too worried.
Huffman: Although he is still prone to shyness, his ability to survey and do mapping has improved a lot, and his work is done in short order.
Huffman: I hear he's joining the Guerrilla Assault platoon next, and he probably won't be back in town for a while. I wish him all the best!

Windblume's Breath[]

Huffman: Greetings, the Knights of Favonius are at your service.
Huffman: Blessings of the Anemo Archon upon you. On this romantic festival, I bid you and your companions joy and cheer.
(Dialogue continues with the same options as normal)

It's only later on that I discovered the Knights of Favonius actually have that kind of role. Thanks to my father and brother's support, I was able to make it through the selection process and become a Front-Line Surveyor. This job has let me live out my dreams, and it's already brought me lots of fulfillment.Least Favorite Food Media:VO_Mika Least Favorite Food.ogg Media:VO ZH_Mika Least Favorite Food.ogg Media:VO JA_Mika Least Favorite Food.ogg Media:VO KO_Mika Least Favorite Food.ogg Unlike my brother, I can't stand the taste of alcohol. All it takes is one sip and I'd be out cold, and the others would have to go out of their way to take care of me.
