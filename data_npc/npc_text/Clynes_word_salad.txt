Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Scenes from Life in Meropide: Memories.


Clynes: The wise always take orders from fools... Oh, sorry. Did you need something?
 Are you an engineer?
Clynes: I guess. I'm lucky enough to have the skills needed to make a living here helping the guards fix things.
Clynes: I don't know what my former colleagues would think if they saw me now... But I'm happy with the way things are, and that's enough, right?
 About the Fortress of Meropide's clockwork meka...
Clynes: The ones found here are all standard models. Not much to say about them. Now, if I were to upgrade them... Ah, why even bother thinking about it?
 It's nothing.
Clynes: Well then, goodbye.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Scenes from Life in Meropide: Memories.


Clynes: We meet again! Great to see you.
 How have you been?
Clynes: Not good, but not bad either. Which is excellent for me. What about you? Is everything going smoothly lately?
 Smooth sailing.
Clynes: I think if it was you, even if you ran into difficulty you'd be able to deal with it without breaking a sweat.
Clynes: Haha. That sounded like I was being sarcastic, didn't it? But I really do think so. You and I are made of completely different stuff, and I can see your quality.
 Hard to say...
Clynes: Not so smooth then, it seems. Well, that's unavoidable. If you keep moving forward and face new challenges you have to expect some obstacles and problems along the way.
Clynes: But you have the courage to overcome those obstacles and the wisdom to solve those problems. Any seybacks are merely temporary, right?
 About the Fontaine Research Institute...
Clynes: I have nothing to say about that. I'd rather keep my memories about that place and its people to myself.
Clynes: I do run into former colleagues here sometimes. But I was never very well-known.
Clynes: I don't think they recognize me as a former employee of the Fontaine Research Institute. Which makes life easier for me...
 I've got something to do. See you later.
Clynes: Hope it goes well.
