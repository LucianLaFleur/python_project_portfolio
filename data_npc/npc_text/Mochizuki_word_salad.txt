 We were misunderstood...
Media:VO Mochizuki 01.ogg "Well, it will be no good if we were misunderstood."

Dialogue[]

Mochizuki: Are researchers all this careless nowadays...
 You seem upset.
Mochizuki: Yes, and you want to know why? It's because there's this researcher from Sumeru running around spreading false histories!
Mochizuki: I don't know what school of reasoning he's from, but whatever it is, he's just spinning out fantasies and distortions!
Mochizuki: He doesn't seem all that fond of verifying anything, but oh, he's very fascinated with non-existent hypotheses and stories, that's for sure! He's giving me a real headache...
Mochizuki: I only hope that people aren't taken in by his words and forget Sangonomiya Shrine's real history...
 So, what's this true history that you speak of all about?
Mochizuki: The truth is that the very first shrine on Watatsumi Island is not here at Sangonomiya Shrine. It's actually to the west of the island, where the Statue of The Seven is now.
Mochizuki: After Watatsumi Omikami was slain by the Electro Archon, Sangonomiya Shrine became our sanctuary where we worship Watatsumi Omikami.
Mochizuki: A long time ago, when our ancestors were still suffering deep beneath the waves, it was Watatsumi Omikami who defeated the Dragonheir of the Depths and brought them to the surface where the sun shone...
Mochizuki: The great coral above Sangonomiya Shrine was a gift given by Watatsumi Omikami from its own body, and thus did it gain its name.
 I believe you.
Mochizuki: Hah... That's good.
Mochizuki: I remember Her Excellency saying that human wisdom is like a pearl, and that its shine will withstand the test of time.
Mochizuki: You know what? Take this with you.
(Obtain  Sango Pearl ×4)
 See you.
Mochizuki: See you. I just hope people don't misunderstand...
