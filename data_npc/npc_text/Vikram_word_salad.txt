Vikram is the obvious candidate for the next Grand Conservator. He's good at communicating, and will surely be able to strike a balance between the various schools of thought.—Shatir
Vikram is a charismatic and persuasive individual, and has managed to get funding for his research despite the Akademiya's increasingly limited funding for regular researchers and students.[2]
Vikram's research focuses on King Deshret, and he is sponsoring Baharak's adventure to the desert to find traces of King Deshret's kin (or familiars). He also asked Baharak to pass on a message to Gohar, a woman living in Caravan Ribat, to meet him in Sumeru City. By the time Baharak arrived, however, Gohar had already received a letter via Dusk Bird with the same message and left for the city.[1][3]

Trivia[]
There are suggestions that Vikram and Gohar are lovers. According to a message on the Akademiya Public Message Board, Vikram is married,[4] and Hawad in Caravan Ribat says that Gohar traveled to Sumeru City to meet with her lover. Furthermore, a message on the Caravan Ribat Bulletin Board has its author refer to their lover as "learned and wise";[5] based on context clues from the NPCs in Caravan Ribat, this message was likely written by Gohar herself.
According to Arina and Armin, he has taught students that Aranara exist "conceptually," though they aren't sure what he means by that.
Etymology[]
The name Vikram is derived from Sanskrit and is generally translated as "valorous."
