 Nice weather...
Media:VO Liath 01.ogg "I hope the weather is nice like this tomorrow, as well."

Dialogue[]

Liath: Ah, such fine weather — you think so too, don't you?
 What are you doing?
Liath: I'm patrolling... and enjoying the weather as I do.
Liath: Whether rain or shine, it's a good day for a Melusine.

 Could you tell me about the Melusines?
Liath: You'd like to know more about us?
Liath: Hmm... Well, we were born from the flesh and blood of the giant beast Elynas.
Liath: Don't be shocked by that. Elynas is a gentle mother who taught us children how to survive in this world.
Liath: Later, however, Elynas ceased speaking, and so we asked Monsieur Neuvillette to take us to the Court of Fontaine to live.
Liath: And that's how I came to be here, patrolling this place in my uniform. We've had lots of help — we're a very fortunate race, I think.
 About this uniform...
Liath: We work with human beings to protect Fontaine — such is the mission entrusted to us by Monsieur Neuvillette.
Liath: Even though Monsieur Neuvillette has been very kind to us, we were only able to join the Marechaussee Phantom after going through training and tests, just like humans.
Liath: I guess this is the "fairness" that people from the Palais Mermonia keep talking about.

 I shan't bother you further, then.
Liath: There's no problem. We can enjoy the weather together!

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
"Liath" may be named in reference to Liath Luachra, a character in the Fenian Cycle, one of the four main cycles of Irish mythology. In this myth, Liath Luachra is a fairy-like being who lives in a forest, who is the caretaker of the young hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill.
Liath means "gray" in both Irish and Scottish Gaelic.
