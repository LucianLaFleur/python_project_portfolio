Dialogue[]
Ardravi Valley[]

(Talk to Aragita)
Aragita: It's Aranara's friend! Good Nara, want to play with Aragita?
 Sure. What are we playing?
Aragita: Under the wooden chests there are not only lizards but also other things. Nara shall remember the position of the pile of leaves.
 That's trivial. Let's get started.
(Starts countdown)
 The timing isn't right.
Aragita: Aragita won't rush. Will wait for the "right timing."
(If the player destroys a pile of leaves during the countdown)
Aragita: Wait! No, no, no! Don't you know how to play this game, Nara? ... Did Aragita not explain properly? Ugh, you've ruined Aragita's preparations...
Aragita: Bad Nara! Aragita will remember this!
(After the countdown ends)
Aragita: A huge pile of leaves. Does Nara know where it is?
(If the player destroys the wrong crate)
Aragita: Nara got it wrong, but it doesn't matter. There is a lot of "next time." Any time playing with Nara is "the right time" for Aragita.
(If the player successfully completes the challenge)
Aragita: Hehe, Aragita's happy. This is for Nara. Come back and hang out with Aragita in the future!
(A Common Chest appears)
(Talk to Aragita after completing the challenge)
Aragita: Grass and trees remember, so does Nara. Nara is Aranara's friend, and the friend of grass and trees, too.

Ashavan Realm (South-East)[]

(Talk to Aragita)
Aragita: It's been a long wait for Aragita and the Golden Nara is finally here. Don't let this chance slip away. Let's play?
 Sure. What are we playing?
Aragita: Aragita hid all kinds of paintings under the wooden chests to see if Nara has the ability of "never forget." Remember the painting with the most strokes?
 Okay, let's do this.
(Starts countdown)
 Not the right timing.
Aragita: Aragita won't rush. Will wait for the "right timing."
(After the countdown ends)
Aragita: The one with the most strokes! Does Nara know where it is?
(If the player destroys the wrong crate)
Aragita: Nara got it wrong, but it doesn't matter. There is a lot of "next time." Any time playing with Nara is "the right time" for Aragita.
(If the player successfully completes the challenge)
Aragita: Hehe, Aragita's happy. This is for Nara. Come back and hang out with Aragita in the future!
(A Common Chest appears)
(Talk to Aragita after completing the challenge)
Aragita: Hmm... "Treasure Chest" seems nice? Should we borrow some "Treasure Chests" from its owner...

Vissudha Field[]

(Talk to Aragita)
Aragita: Hehe, the wind in the forest told Aragita Nara's coming to play with Aragita.
 Sure. What are we playing?
Aragita: A wooden chest can store a lot of things, like... shiny of various elements! Aragita remembers where the Dendro shiny is. Can Nara also remember?
 No problem. Let's do this.
(Starts countdown)
 Not the right timing.
Aragita: Aragita won't rush. Will wait for the "right timing."
(After the countdown ends)
Aragita: Does Nara know where the Dendro Shiny is hidden?
(If the player collect elemental particles before the wooden crate appear)
Aragita: Ah! Greedy Nara! Don't think you can forget about the shinies just because you ate them! You may have eaten them, but Aragita remembers!
(If the player destroys the wrong crate)
Aragita: Nara got it wrong, but it doesn't matter. There is a lot of "next time." Any time playing with Nara is "the right time" for Aragita.
(If the player successfully completes the challenge)
Aragita: Hehe, Aragita's happy. This is for Nara. Come back and hang out with Aragita in the future!
(A Common Chest appears)
(Talk to Aragita after completing the challenge)
Aragita: A crunchy wooden chest is all we need.
