Dialogue[]

Yiran: Manager Kuan! I want to buy a kite!
Manager Kuan: How many times do I have to tell you, just call me "Daddy." Now, if you study hard, Daddy will buy you one, alright?
Yiran: No! Aren't you the shift supervisor of the Blackcliff Forge, Manager Kuan? As the supervisor, it's up to you to set an example.
Manager Kuan: But Daddy has to work, and you have to study. These are two completely differ—
Yiran: Then let's talk about work! "Let our actions be recognized by hard work. Let our achievements be what speaks first." Isn't that right?
Manager Kuan: That's right, that's the Blackcliff Forge motto... How'd you remember that so clearly?
Yiran: So let's start from your actions. If you buy me the kite, Manager Kuan, then I will recognize your hard work!
Manager Kuan: How many times do I have to say it — I'm "Daddy"! And how did this suddenly become about me? It's like you're trapping me in...
Yiran: You're the one that started talking about work, aren't you?
Manager Kuan: *sigh* Alright, then. I'll buy you a kite. But from now on, you must call me "Daddy."
Yiran: Alright, "Daddy"! Now, Daddy! Do as you promised!

Event Dialogue[]
Lantern Rite[]

Yiran: Manager Kuan! I don't want a kite, I want a Xiao Lantern!
Manager Kuan: How many times do I have to tell you, just call me "Daddy."
Manager Kuan: If you want a Xiao Lantern, then we can just release one together. Now, if you want to write a wish on the lantern, just tell me and I'll...
Yiran: No way! Your handwriting is terrible, Manager Kuan. If you write it, our wish will never come true!
Manager Kuan: Ah, child, how could you ever be so cold to your Daddy...
Yiran: But aren't you the one who taught me to always be honest about what's on my mind?
Yiran: And since I know that your handwriting is absolutely terrible, wouldn't I be disobeying if I told you it's fine for you to write?
Manager Kuan: *sigh* Fine, you're right... I'll buy you a lantern... But from now on, you must call me "Daddy."
Yiran: Alright, "Daddy"! Now, Daddy! Do as you promised!

Moonlight Merriment[]

Yiran: Manager Kuan! I want the moon!
Manager Kuan: Hey, aren't each of your requests becoming less reasonable than the last? Also, for the last time, just call me "Daddy."
Yiran: Nope. Also, my requests are not that unreasonable.
Yiran: Isn't the Moonchase Festival all about chasing the moon? If you can get it for me, Manager Kuan, then no one will have to chase it.
Yiran: That would make you everyone's hero, Manager Kuan!
Manager Kuan: I'm not some hero, I'm just Kuan... No, wait,  I'm your Daddy!
Yiran: Well, if you're my Daddy, and then you can fulfill my wishes, right? I'll study hard, and you'll get me the moon. That's fair, right?
Manager Kuan: I don't think this is a question of fairness. It's more that... I can't get the moon in the first place.
Yiran: *sigh* Then until you get the moon, you're not a hero, you're Manager Kuan.

The Exquisite Night Chimes[]

(After completing A Thousand Miles for an Enigmatic Tune)
Yiran: Manager Kuan, I wanna hear a song. Sing a song for me!
Manager Kuan: Firstly, for the umpteenth time, just call me "Daddy."
Yiran: No! And don't try to change the subject.
Yiran: It's a music festival, so everyone should be playing music or singing!
Yiran: Playing music is a little too difficult for you, Manager Kuan, but you should at least sing something!
Manager Kuan: I'm not a singer, I'm just Manager Kuan... No, wait, I'm your Daddy!
Yiran: Since you're my Daddy, wouldn't it be natural that you'd be better than me?
Yiran: Even I can sing a few lines... Lalala~... lala~!
Yiran: If Manager Kuan can't sing better than me, how can he be my Daddy?

Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze[]

Yiran: Manager Kuan! Thanks for the kite you bought me! Now, let's go fly it!
Manager Kuan: Firstly, for the umpteenth time, just call me "Daddy."
Manager Kuan: Also, since I bought that kite, could you call me "Daddy"?
Yiran: Well, if you're "Daddy," why don't you take me kite-flying?
Manager Kuan: This... Well, Daddy's been working, so he doesn't know how to fly kites.
Yiran: In that case, maybe you should learn, Manager Kuan!
Yiran: You always tell me to study hard, Manager Kuan, so now it's your turn!
Yiran: You've gotta set a good example, right, Daddy?
