 Finally a day off...
Media:VO Sedile 01.ogg "Ahh, finally a day off... Time for me to get some well-earned rest."

Dialogue[]

Sedile: Huh. You're an unfamiliar face. Where did you come from? How did you come to our village?
Sedile: Ah, don't be nervous. You must be an adventurer from afar. Sorry. Force of habit from work. I just wanted to say hello.
 A habit you picked up at work?
Sedile: Yeah. I'm Sedile, an agent of the Marechaussee Phantom. My usual work involves site inspection and information collection — all to ensure the safety of Fontaine's citizens.
Sedile: So, well... Heh. When I see people I haven't seen before, I get a little nervous. Sorry about that.
 So there are people from the Marechaussee Phantom in Merusea Village too, huh.
Sedile: Well, that's a matter of course, though, well, I'm just here on vacation...
Sedile: If I was one of my colleagues on the job, I wouldn't just be hanging around willy-nilly.
(After Step 3 of There Will Come Soft Rains and before completing Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog)
 About the earthquake just a while ago...
Sedile: Yeah, everything shook super hard back there. Ugh. How's a person supposed to rest like this?
Sedile: Fortunately, the village seems fine. Hopefully, the other areas aren't affected, either...
 See you later...
Sedile: ...Alright. I hope you have a good time in the village — but don't do anything bad! I'm on vacation, and I... really don't wanna do any overtime...
