 The right decision...
Media:VO Eunomia 01.ogg "Leaving the Ministry of External Relations was definitely the right decision."

Dialogue[]

Eunomia: Everything must have proper standards. I must admit that I prefer such work.
 You "prefer"?
Eunomia: That's right. I'm comparing this to my previous work in external publicity relations, by the way.
Eunomia: I'll never be able to understand how some of my old colleagues thought. It's almost as if they had a waterfall in their heads that could wash all their reason away.
Eunomia: "We should construct a bust of the Chief Justice at the entrance to the Palais Mermonia!"
Eunomia: —They'd say, as if we didn't have enough people coming in from outside.
 Tell me about measurement standards...
Eunomia: Well, that's the focus of my work.
Eunomia: As you know, people who live in different regions have different habits when taking measurements.
Eunomia: The people in the eastern part of the city say that a length of rope is a quarter-meter long, and people in the west will ask "and how much is that, exactly?"
Eunomia: My job is to match these things that don't fit together and come up with a common name for them, for example, "Mermonia Meters," or something of the order.
Eunomia: That was just an example, by the way. Please don't take it too seriously.
 See you.
Eunomia: See you.

Trivia[]
In Greek mythology, Eunomia was a minor goddess of law and legislation.
The dialogue about measurement standards is a reference to the International System of Units, which aims to standardize units worldwide.
