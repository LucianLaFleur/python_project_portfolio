Karl Ingold is a historical character from Fontaine who lived around 400–500 years ago.
When he was a journalist, he communicated between Eduardo Baker's faction and the Court of Fontaine before the Siege of Poisson devastated Baker's faction and left Karl disillusioned with journalism.[1][2] Years later, he was entrusted with the care of Jakob and Rene de Petrichor, two children from the Narzissenkreuz Institute who had been left there following the Siege of Poisson.

Profile[]
Karl grew up with Basil Elton, Emanuel Guillotin, and Dwight Lasker,[3] and grew up to become a journalist. After Eduardo Baker, who had been sentenced to exile in the Girdle of the Sands for resisting the purge of Fleuve Cendre, escaped and took the Maison Gardiennage members escorting him hostage at Poisson, Karl volunteered to bring his demands to the Court of Fontaine.[1] After much back-and-forth,[2] negotiations broke down and the Marechaussee Phantoms' violent response — which culminated in razing Poisson[3] — left Karl disillusioned.[2]
When the cataclysm struck, Elton left Karl with custody over Jakob and Rene, believing that the Narzissenkreuz Institute would be unsafe in the calamity to come and that it would be better to send the children to trusted individuals before it was too late.[4] Little is currently known about Karl's relationship with Jakob, but Rene's Investigation Notes indicate that he and Rene were not particularly close; during their trip to the Khaenri'ahn ruins at the Girdle of the Sands, the two argued over Rene's idea of utilizing the power of the Abyss.
According to those same notes, his body composition was different to that of Jakob and Rene, whose compositions were more like the remains of the former Hydro Archon, Egeria. Since Fontainians are originally transformed Oceanids,[5] this implies that Karl was not descended from native Fontainians, unlike Jakob and Rene.
