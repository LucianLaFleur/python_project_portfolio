 Hydrology research...
Media:VO Broglie 01.ogg "*sigh* Now I'll be able to continue with my hydrology research."

Dialogue[]

Broglie: Oh, hello! May I ask if there is anything I might help you with?
 About hydrological research...
Broglie: To be frank, myself and my admirable colleagues have already... uh...
Broglie: We have completed compiling the data with an efficiency that astonishes even ourselves. And our findings have already been submitted for review.
Broglie: Our department supervisor was overjoyed to approve, and without even a glance he drew a big circle on the report to indicate he had reviewed it and passed it on up the chain...
Broglie: After all, the approval of something like this cannot be decided by our supervisor alone.
 How long will it take, approximately?
Broglie: Hmm. If all goes well, about three months or so. But if, as expected, the unexpected happens, then it's hard to say.
Broglie: You see, a request like this requires approval from the Maison Gestion. And I would imagine you've heard tell of just how... efficient... those gentlemen are?
 So you're...
Broglie: As you can see, I am conscientiously fulfilling my professional obligations.
Broglie: You see, my supervisor has approved my transfer request. So, in principle, at least...
Broglie: I am no longer a researcher at the Department of Hydrology and Aquatic Life Conservation. And naturally that means I no longer need to go to the office.
Broglie: Also, as the Maison Gestion has not yet granted its approval, I am not yet officially an employee of the Hydrology Monitoring Station... The entire department has been dissolved.
Broglie: And therefore, due to the restrictions thus imposed by outside conditions, all I can do now is arrange some work for myself. *sigh* There's nothing I can do about it...
 I hope it all goes smoothly...
Broglie: And I wish you a safe journey.
