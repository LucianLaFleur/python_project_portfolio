Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

Aragaru: Golden Nara received many flowers. Friends of Vanarana are friends of mine.
 Hello...
Aragaru: Hello, Golden Nara...
Aragaru: You will be like Nara Varuna, and become a story we Aranara will not forget. I think so.
 Goodbye...
Aragaru: Bye, Golden Nara...

Dialogue Set #2[]

Aragaru: Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) is a new friend, but has already received flowers a long time ago, from me.
 About flowers...
Aragaru: Festival Utsava was a very happy time, and Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) also received many flowers.
Aragaru: I am very curious. Why did Golden Nara receive everyone's flowers like the flowers are raindrops converging into river?
Aragaru: I see, so I had given flowers long ago in the story.
 About bad Nara...
Aragaru: I gave the bad Nara flowers. But I don't know who it was, because I don't remember.
Aragaru: But at that time, the bad Nara was definitely not bad yet.
Aragaru: Sometimes, when the bright moon rose, Nara was still a good child. But when the sun rose again, Nara became bad. I don't understand...
Aragaru: But no matter how many times the sun and moon rise and set, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) will always be like Nara Varuna, shining like gold.
 Goodbye.
Aragaru: Bye, shining Golden Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).

Trivia[]
There is a bug wherein some of Aragaru's dialogue will trigger when the player explores through the depths of Chatrakam Cave even after they have already completed the Quest.
Etymology[]
"Aragaru" might be derived from Garuda, the divine king of birds and the mount of the deity Vishnu in Hinduism.
This is based on the interpretation that Aranaga and Aranakin, who are also involved in Agnihotra Sutra, are named after heavenly beings.
