Dialogue[]

Harry: Oh! hi!
Harry: Do you need a hand with anything?
 Who are you?
Harry: I'm Harry from the Knights of Favonius.
Harry: I have been posted here by the Knights to help victims of the attack.
 What kind of help do you provide?
Harry: For regular citizens, I help escort them safely to the city, to Springvale, or wherever.
Harry: For people who know how to look after themselves, adventurers and the like, I offer training in self-defense.
Harry: Seems like you fall in the latter category. So please take this sword, and take care of yourself.
(Obtain 3★  Cool Steel)
 What are you doing?
Harry: I am gathering information on where monsters are stationed along this road. It'll help me better protect the merchants' route.
Harry: If the situation gets worse, intel like this will help me convince the Acting Grand Master that the Stormbearer Mountains area is in dire need of a cleanup operation!
Harry: Just like the Grand Master's one, back in the day!
 Goodbye.
Harry: What? You're leaving already?
