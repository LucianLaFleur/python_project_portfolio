Takizawa Kyouden (Japanese: 瀧澤京伝 Takizawa Kyouden) was a famous author in Inazuma. "Toki Alley Tales" is one of his notable works.
He is mentioned in several bulletin boards in Inazuma, as Hiratsuka of the Yae Publishing House lost the only extant copy of "Toki Alley Tales" and Yae Miko bid her to put up lost book notices.[1] The Traveler can find the torn pages of the book scattered across the archipelago.
Sumida begins talking about Kyouden at one point, starting about how he was 33 years old when he read a certain work, but is interrupted by Ryuuji before she can continue.[2]
