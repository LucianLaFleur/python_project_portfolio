Dialogue[]

Aikawa Susumu: Let the Aisa Bathhouse warm your heart. Experience the glamour of Natlan.
Aikawa Susumu: Ahh, it's a traveler from afar. What a rare guest. Welcome.
 The glamour of Natlan?
Aikawa Susumu: Haha, it might be a little too much to call it "glamour"... Aisa Bathhouse is a hot spring inn in Inazuma that I founded after experiencing the volcanic hot springs in Natlan.
Aikawa Susumu: The healing power of a hot spring is unforgettable once you've tried it. After I returned home, I also wanted my friends in Inazuma to experience that same warm and comforting feeling.
Aikawa Susumu: I had no idea Aisa Bathhouse would become so popular. Even some big shots frequent this place, something that makes me regret setting the price so low. Haha.
 Big Shots?
Aikawa Susumu: By no means are they senior government officials... I meant those samurai from the Tenryou Commission. They often come here. But since I'm just a little commoner, they're pretty important in my book, haha.
Aikawa Susumu: Some of them have become regular customers. I make note of it and offer them a discount.
Aikawa Susumu: I guess it must be because they can see plainly and speak frankly while at a hot spring. That must do wonders for fatigue relief.
Aikawa Susumu: Someday, I hope that even the Almighty Shogun herself might grace our hot springs with her presence... I imagine she must be in need of some relaxation, given how she has to worry about so many affairs of state...
 What's Natlan like?
Aikawa Susumu: Haha, it's nothing like Inazuma, which has oceans surrounding it. Natlan is a country of red-hot passion, both in name and climate.
Aikawa Susumu: What I said might be a bit confusing, so here are souvenirs I brought back. You can have them. Who knows, you might be able to get a sense of Natlan's scorching temperatures.
(Obtain  Agnidus Agate Fragment ×1)
 Goodbye.
Aikawa Susumu: Goodbye. Feel free to relax in the hot spring when you are tired.
