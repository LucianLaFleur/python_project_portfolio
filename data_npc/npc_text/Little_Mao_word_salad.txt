Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(If Little Mao is in Qiaoying Village)
Little Mao: Wait for me to come back. Once I do, I'll tell you Big Sis Fujin's story!
 Don't sneak into the mountains by yourself. It's dangerous.
Little Mao: I know. Uncle Luo and Grandpa Lu always say that too, but... Hehe, they can't keep an eye on me all the time, can they?
Little Mao: The mountains really aren't that dangerous. Bluey and Big Sis Fujin are there too. It's been a while since I've played with Bluey, too.
Little Mao: I wanted to introduce Grandpa Lu to Bluey earlier, but she said that wasn't a good idea, so I dropped the idea.
 They're both adepti, so I'm sure everything will be fine.
Little Mao: Really? But... if they're fine, why couldn't I find Bluey anywhere when I went to play in the mountains after that, then?
Little Mao: I walked along the river for ages, eating several large fruits and getting hungry two or three times along the way, but I couldn't find her anywhere. In the end, I lay down next to a giant tree and fell asleep. It was in my dream that I saw her.
Little Mao: She told me to eat until I was full after waking up and then go home first because she was busy with something.
Little Mao: After I woke up, I ate the fruits Bluey left next to me and then went home like she told me to...
Little Mao: Bluey didn't tell me what she was busy with... but maybe I can help her!
 Wait, Bluey gave you fruits?
Little Mao: Yes. There was a big pile of fruits next to me when I woke up. Some were sweet, and some were sour, and some were really difficult to bite into. Oh, some of them spurted juice all over my clothes when I bit them. Fortunately, I was next to a river, so I could wash my clothes there.
Little Mao: *sigh* I wonder when Bluey will finish with whatever she's doing. I miss her and Big Sis Fujin...
 Goodbye.
Little Mao: Bye! Remember to say hello for me if you see Bluey and Big Sis Fujin, alright?

Dialogue Set #2[]

(If Lingyuan and Little Mao are at Mt. Lingmeng)
Little Mao: Bluey, Bluey, you didn't tell me the ending to that story you were telling me last time!
Lingyuan: Yes. I remember. However, I've changed my mind.
Little Mao: "Changed your mind"? What's that supposed to mean?
Lingyuan: I'll leave the ending of the story... to you.
Little Mao: Ehhh!? C'mon, Bluey, that's cheating! You promised that you'd tell me a story if I told you one! How come I'm the one telling both stories now!?
Lingyuan: I'm just a simple-minded beast. I cannot think of a good ending.
Lingyuan: The ending I came up with was a bad ending. The story is also a bad story that wouldn't make anyone happy. So, I'll let you tell the ending of the story.
Little Mao: But that's still cheating!
Lingyuan: I do not deny that. As compensation, I can take you to see the hidden sights of Mt. Lingmeng.
Lingyuan: ...
Lingyuan: Don't make that face. I will give you special permission to... Sit on my back, for five minutes or so. Ten minutes will do, too.
Little Mao: In... In that case, then it's a deal! I'll think of an ending for the story...

Dialogue Set #3[]

(If Hautemontagne and Little Mao are in Yilong Wharf)
Little Mao: Listening to Mountain, it sounds like Fontaine's operas are pretty similar to ours!
Little Mao: Knights, magicians, brave warriors, and evil dragons, you kill me, I kill you, and in the end, everyone winds up dead!
Hautemontagne: What's important isn't the ending! It's the process — how you get there! Not every tragedy can be seen as a mere sequence of fight scenes!
Little Mao: Oh, oh! And the "Ray-more-young Golems" Mountain was just talking about sound really, really cool too! I wonder if they're bigger than Bluey?
Hautemontagne: Eh? Bluey?
Little Mao: Oh, right! I never told you about Bluey, did I... How about this? You tell me more about "Ray-more-young Golems," and I'll tell you about Bluey!
