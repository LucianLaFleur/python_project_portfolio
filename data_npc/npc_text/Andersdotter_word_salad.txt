Profile[]
Andersdotter was a human who never received magic or combat training, and was "simply ordinary" in comparison to other members of the Hexenzirkel.[6] She was described as "A legend that never ends" for her stories, and her prose was able to teach Alice the meaning of grief.[5]
In The Mages' Tea Party cutscene, Andersdotter is represented first by the cover of The Boar Princess, and later by the titular Boar Princess and her fox and turtle companions.[7]

Appearance[]
Andersdotter's likeness has only been hinted once in the game's media, potentially being the one embellished on the ink pot she used, showing a woman with long, curly, seemingly orange or ginger hair.

Story[]
When I. Ivanovna decided that she would leave the group after marrying, Andersdotter, Alice, Barbeloth, Nicole, and Rhinedottir wrote her a letter disguised as a prophecy, asking her to come visit them one last time before her wedding.[5]
In her old age, Andersdotter once commented to the group that because her lifespan was much shorter than some of theirs, she wished to leave her storybook — The Boar Princess — to them, and that they may pass it to the next generations.[7]

Trivia[]
The other Hexenzirkel members wrote The Little Witch and the Undying Fire for Andersdotter. However, it is implied that she passed away sometime during the writing of Vol. 5 and never got to read it.
Etymology[]
The name Andersdotter is likely a reference to the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, who is best known for his fairy tales. Andersen is a patronymic meaning "son of Anders," making Andersdotter "daughter of Anders."
