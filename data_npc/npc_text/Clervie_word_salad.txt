Clervie is a quest-exclusive NPC who appears in Arlecchino's Story Quest Ignis Purgatorius Chapter: Act I - When the Hearth-Flame Goes Out, and first appeared in the animated short The Song Burning in the Embers. 
She was the biological daughter of Crucabena,[5] previous director of the House of the Hearth and former "Knave" of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers. Clervie was raised in the House of the Hearth alongside Peruere; with Clervie's death becoming one of Peruere's primary motivations for killing Crucabena, leading to her becoming a Harbinger and new director of the House of the Hearth as Arlecchino, the current "Knave".[6]

Profile[]
Clervie was Crucabena's biological daughter who was raised in the House of the Hearth starting when she was six years old. She and another orphan, Peruere, became close friends and were aware of Crucabena's hidden cruelty; the other orphans were oblivious to Crucabena's true nature and were raised to believe that her methods were normal. Despite Clervie's attempts to obtain freedom for herself and her fellow Hearth members, her efforts were futile and Crucabena tortured her to make an example of her. Later on, Clervie chose to die at Peruere's hands, believing that Peruere was capable of much more than she was, and seeing death as her only option for freedom.
Clervie's shadow, a childhood version of her, was absorbed by Peruere due to her unique abilities. Unaware of everything that transpired since her childhood — including her own demise, Crucabena's assassination, and Peruere's rise as the new House of the Hearth director — this version of Clervie appears during When the Hearth-Flame Goes Out, instigating dissent among the House of the Hearth's members in her attempt to save them from Crucabena's rule.

Appearance[]
Clervie has light pink hair and light green eyes. She wears a white headband and a white dress, and a blue necklace shaped like a Lumidouce Bell.

Story[]
History[]
When she was six, Crucabena took Clervie into the House of the Hearth in order to show that all children were treated equally. However, Clervie saw through her ruse as time went on, seeing the House as nothing more than a purgatory as she forced orphans to battle each other and saw many killed or sent to either The Doctor or sent on dangerous missions to die.
At some point, she met Peruere, who was the only other child who saw through Crucabena's lies. The two became close friends and Crucabena sent Clervie to look after Peruere whenever she suffered from her curse, such as when her pet spider died. They often spent time together, with Clervie suggesting that they see the auroras in Snezhnaya when they grew up.[6] Clervie tried her best to convince her mother to change her ways and even attempted to escape at times, but was caught and subsequently tortured to make an example of her to crush any signs of hope to escape the organization.[7]
When Clervie was sixteen years old, Crucabena ordered everyone to duel to the death so one could rise as the "king." Clervie tried to unite everyone by having them duel to a draw instead, despite knowing this only delayed the inevitable.[7] In the end, Clervie ended up facing against Peruere and died at her hands, seeing death as her only way of obtaining freedom.[6]
While Clervie never agreed to Peruere's plan to kill Crucabena, with Clervie dead, Peruere decided to fulfill her plan on her own. At the start of their duel, Crucabena used a wilted flower — one which Clervie used to wear — as an allegory for Clervie herself, indirectly mocking her late daughter and calling Peruere's sentiments "useless." Despite their gap in strength, Peruere used her curse and her recently acquired Vision,[8] which she kept secret from Crucabena, to kill the Harbinger. She was imprisoned in Snezhnaya for the deed, where she witnessed an aurora from her cell and fulfilled her promise to Clervie.[6]

Present Day[]
Peruere, who had a unique constitution, ended up absorbing Clervie's shadow, which merged with other shadows her flames had consumed over the years, something which was exceedingly slim. Despite this, she was not a true entity in itself, as she could only appear in shadows and was not able to eat actual food. This version of Clervie — who had somehow regressed into a younger version of herself and did not know her own fate — would follow the House wherever they went, and convinced other disillusioned members to leave, which included Nanteuil and Filliol. She also made contact with Chapleau, managing to save his life and also Freminet.
When her presence was made known to Lyney and Lynette, the three, along with Paimon and the Traveler, try to deduce her origins and stall Arlecchino. Arlecchino, having already known of her existence, instead issues an ultimatium for the Traveler to pass onto her "children;" to successfully remove her from the House, or they would be punished for treason. Ultimately, they are unable to figure out how to put her to peace.
Clervie later reunites with Peruere at the spot where she died, though she remains silent until Arlecchino finishes her conversation with the rest of her "children." She is surprised to see that the other girl much older than she remembered. Arlecchino reveals to Clervie that she's only a shadow of the real Clervie, and fills Clervie in on the truth regarding the rest of her life and what transpired afterwards. To fulfill Clervie's wish to learn about the rest of the world, Paimon and the Traveler tell her about their adventures across Teyvat. Afterwards, Arlecchino dismissed Clervie as a member of the House, granting her wish to be free; although briefly elated about being able to see the rest of the world, Clervie remembers the reality of the situation after seeing Paimon and the Traveler's reactions. She instead bids goodbye to Peruere and disappears into blue petals, while Arlecchino leaves some of her own sentiments unsaid. With her wishes fulfilled, Clervie's shadow finds peace, and her presence is no longer sensed by the other members of the House.[7]

How could any of us know the answer when the House of the Hearth is made up entirely of people who never had a place to call home.By killing Crucabena, I was able to assume the identity of "Father" and rebuild the House under a new set of rules. Still, I'm well aware that, even with these efforts, the House is far from that ideal. As for what a real home truly looks like, I suppose that question is best put to the side for now... Perhaps one day, Lyney will be able to give me a new answer.
