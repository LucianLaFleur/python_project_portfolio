Dialogue[]

Wenze: Hello, are you also an adventurer searching for the Abandoned City?
 Abandoned City?
Wenze: Oh, you haven't heard? Somewhere beneath these ruins lies an ancient abandoned city.
Wenze: Rumors of such a place have circulated for many generations at the Adventurers' Guild, but nobody has found it yet.
 What's the history of this place?
Wenze: These ruins were once a city, too. But it was probably abandoned long before even the Archon War.
Wenze: It is said that beneath those two trees are buried the bodies of the last king of the ancient city and his enemy, who was also his true love...
Wenze: They perished together, but their burial separates them for eternity.
Wenze: The two trees that grew above the ruins once everything had turned to dust stand, just like them, face to face but separated...
 You seem to know a great deal.
Wenze: Honestly, it's not much. I've loved history since I was little, and I've always wanted to see these ruins in person. That's why I became an adventurer.
Wenze: Well... these are some records I've made of my adventures. You can have them.
Wenze: Nothing would make me happier than to help someone else with my knowledge!
(Obtain  Adventurer's Experience ×4)
 Goodbye.
Wenze: Goodbye. Ad astra abyssosque!
