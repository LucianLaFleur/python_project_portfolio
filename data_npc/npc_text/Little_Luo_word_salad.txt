Dialogue[]

Little Luo: Ah, how I'd like to see that adeptus again today, too. But he doesn't seem to like me...
 An adeptus?
Little Luo: One day, when I was in the forest, I met a handsome, dashing adeptus — it was as if he had popped right out of a story book!
Little Luo: I smiled at him, but he didn't smile back.
Little Luo: He just returned the doll that the hilichurls stole back to me... Do you think he doesn't like me, by any chance?
 Maybe?
Little Luo: That... That's sad...
Little Luo: How do I get him to like me? ...Oh, I've never had this problem before...
 I'd say he actually likes you.
Little Luo: Really?
Little Luo: ...I did think about it as well, does he just not like smiling?
Little Luo: If I see him again, I'll definitely find a way to make him smile.
 Stay safe, then.
Little Luo: I'll be fine! If there's any danger, I'm sure the adeptus will come to rescue me.
