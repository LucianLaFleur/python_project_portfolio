Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa is actually a gentle soul. Too gentle, in fact, and that's why she had to harden herself. Likewise, she declared war against the whole world only because she dreams of peace.—Tartaglia[1]
The Tsaritsa (Russian: Царица Tsaritsa), her Goetic name and corresponding ideal yet unknown, is the Cryo Archon among The Seven who presides over Snezhnaya.
With supreme rule over Snezhnaya, she uses her loyal followers in the Fatui to manipulate and intimidate the other nations of Teyvat. She is targeting the other Archons' Gnoses for reasons unknown, though it likely relates to her goal of "burning away the old world."
The Tsaritsa also has the ability to grant her subjects a power separate from Visions, called Delusions. High-ranking Fatui such as Fatui Agents, Fatui Cicin Mages, Mirror Maidens, Fatui Operatives and the Eleven Fatui Harbingers use them.

Introduction[]
Sorry... to also have you shoulder the grievances of the world.Since you could endure my bitter cold, you must have the desire to burn?Then, burn away the old world for me.—The Tsaritsa, Shivada Jade Gemstone
The Tsaritsa is not one of the original members of The Seven who emerged victorious at the end of the Archon War. When and how she ascended to the position of Cryo Archon is yet unknown, but it was some time before the cataclysm 500 years ago which left her deeply changed.[2]
In the Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview, Dainsleif says of the Tsaritsa and Snezhnaya: "She is a god with no love left for her people, nor do they have any left for her. Her followers only hope to be on her side when the day of her rebellion against the divine comes at last." This most likely refers to Celestia, or someone or something located on Celestia.

Appearance[]
Nothing is known about the Tsaritsa's appearance besides the fact that she uses a female vessel. Her gaze is described as "cold but pure,"[3] and it is also suggested she wields a scepter.[4]

Story[]
History[]
At some point in the history of The Seven, the Tsaritsa inherited her position from the previous Cryo Archon. She is not the original archon who emerged victorious from the Archon War. She witnessed the events of the cataclysm, which left her severely embittered.
When Il Dottore and Pierro returned with a unique kabukimono from Inazuma after paving the way for future endeavors by sabotaging the Mikage Furnace, the Tsaritsa had the puppet lead expeditions into the Abyss for reasons unknown.
Upon hearing that an orphan from the House of the Hearth killed a Harbinger, she issued a pardon to her alongside with a new name, taking the slain Harbinger's place as the Knave.[5]

Archon Quests[]
While the Tsaritsa does not appear in any quests, her Harbingers enforce her will and goal of rebelling against the divine, having tasked them with obtaining her fellow Archons' Gnoses. She has Signora collect the Gnoses, first having Signora take Barbatos' by force due to the animosity between the two. She negotiated with Morax for his Gnosis, offering him something that he accepted as the "contract to end all contracts." After Paimon inquired as to what she offered, Morax's vessel, Zhongli, informed her and the Traveler that they would find out themselves in their journey across Teyvat.[6]
In Sumeru, Il Dottore claimed that the Tsaritsa had called them back to Snezhnaya, though through the use of his segments, was able to successfully acquire both the Electro Gnosis that Scaramouche had previously taken and gone missing with along with the Dendro Gnosis held by Lesser Lord Kusanali after negotiating with her.
Lyney claims that the Tsaritsa has allowed Arlecchino to use the Hydro Gnosis to resolve the disaster foretold by the prophecy of the Primordial Sea before handing it to the Tsaritsa.[7] She would later acquire it from Arlecchino, who had been given it from Neuvillette as a "diplomatic gift."

I could sense she was a person of true sincerity and compassion, unlike all those pompous hypocrites with their posturing and rhetoric. Yet... It's difficult to say whether her compassion alone is enough to melt the ice and snow that permeates her land. All I can say is this... If we are forced to be at odds one day, I will raise my weapon against her without hesitation, because that is the greatest level of respect I am able to bestow.TartagliaAbout Tsaritsa Media:VO_Tartaglia About Tsaritsa.ogg Media:VO ZH_Tartaglia About Tsaritsa.ogg Media:VO JA_Tartaglia About Tsaritsa.ogg Media:VO KO_Tartaglia About Tsaritsa.ogg Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa is actually a gentle soul.

Trivia[]
Among The Seven, the Tsaritsa's ideal is currently the only one left unconfirmed. However, it is suspected to be love:
In the Teyvat Story Chapter Preview, Dainsleif states that she is a "god with no love left" in the opening sentence in the Snezhnaya Chapter, where he mentions the Archons' ideals in their respective chapters.
Zhongli avoids mentioning her ideal whereas he mentions the others in the Archon Quest Downtown in Chapter I: Act II - Farewell, Archaic Lord, suggesting it may have changed during the cataclysm.
Scaramouche (as the Wanderer), mentions her "love" as another form of "sin".
In the Chinese name for Shivada Jade Gemstone and its item series, "Shivada" is instead 哀叙冰 Āixù Bīng, "Grieving Ice," lit. "Grief-Narrating Ice." The word for "grief," 哀 āi, uses similar sounds as the word for "love," 爱 ài.
In Japanese, the name is 哀切なアイスクリスタル Aisetsu-na Aisu Kurisutaru, "Plaintive Ice Crystal." The kanji meaning "grief," 哀, in this case using the reading ai, is a homophone with the kanji meaning "love," 愛 ai; furthermore, the actual word for grief or sadness, 哀しみ kanashimi, has an archaism meaning love or affection, written 愛しみ kanashimi.
Tsaritsa is the female equivalent of a Tsar. The title has multiple spellings including Tsarina.
