 Processing tea leaves...
Media:VO Ninzou 01.ogg "I never knew there was so much to learn about processing tea leaves."

Dialogue[]

Hitomi: To think that there were so many other preparation techniques for tea leaves apart from steaming! Tea ceremony, observed at its origin — profundity, such profundity...
 The land of origin?
Hitomi: Are you interested in tea preparations too? Then allow me to briefly expound on my understanding...
Hitomi: They say that Inazuman tea and tea ceremonies originate from Liyue, and so Liyue is considered the origin of such practices.
Hitomi: Today, however, Inazuman and Liyue tea ceremonies have completely diverged.
Hitomi: In Qiaoying Village, this novel roasted tea exudes a vibrant aroma.
Hitomi: I think it can be considered the harmony of tea ceremonies.
Hitomi: The blend of the same tea leaves with the tastes of new places eventually causes it to evolve into new forms.
 Good point.
Hitomi: You're too kind. I'm merely expressing my feelings as one who adores tea ceremonies.
 Tea possesses an essence that cannot be changed.
Hitomi: Hmm...
Hitomi: Well, you're right. No matter how the ceremonies change, the feelings of the people who drink tea are always the same.
Hitomi: These are what you mean by "the things that never change," yes?
Hitomi: Ah, who knew tea encompassed such vast knowledge! I've learned so much!
 Goodbye.
Hitomi: See you! Let's have another discussion next time.
