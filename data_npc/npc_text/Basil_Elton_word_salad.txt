Profile[]
Basil Elton was the Admiral of the Fontaine Armada before it was disbanded following a certain incident and her ship, the Sponsian, was wrecked. Afterwards, she chose to retire and was selected to become the Narzissenkreuz Institute's Vice Director, a position granted only to those with "exceptional moral quality and ability."[1] Despite her military background, Basil was a rather easygoing person who was beloved by the children at the Institute. She had a particular knack for making delicious drinks,[3] and picked up baking during her few years there.[4]
Basil was a kind and caring person. According to Mary-Ann, Basil once said that caring for children is like "caring for a flower." Paimon herself adds on thinking that Basil was a "smart" yet "dangerous" person.[5]

Appearance[]
In a photo found during the World Quest Search in the Algae Sea in Series In the Wake of Narcissus: Act I - Search in the Algae Sea, she has dull violet hair and light purple eyes. On her head is a black tricorn lined with gold with the Green Feather Accessory pinned on it.

Story[]
Basil grew up with Emanuel Guillotin, Karl Ingold, and Dwight Lasker in the Narzissenkreuz Institute,[2] and remained friends with them for the rest of her life, even after the Siege of Poisson.[2][4] She was a rather poor cook in her youth, as Guillotin silently eyed her with suspicion when she suggested cooking for the group many years later.[4]
Long before Basil became the admiral, she once conquered the Emperor of Fire and Iron that was attacking a ship and Basil sent it back to the depths.[6]
When Basil was Admiral of the navy, Basil's flagship, the Sponsian, was said to be the pride of the Fontaine's Navy. Basil's First Mate, Nathaniel Pickman, was the one who suggested the name of the ship after the name of a historical usurper. Despite initially criticizing the choice as "awful," Basil recanted her position and named the ship after his suggestion, citing that she did not hate the sense of "unreal reality" that it gave.[7]
After Basil retired from the Navy, the Armada was disbanded and Basil was selected to become Vice Director of the Narzissenkreuz Institute on account of her perceived high moral character, a decision which an unidentified person jokingly criticized.[1] She often baked for the children there — albeit initially not very well — but grew more proficient at it over the years[8] and was known for making particularly good refreshments.[3]

Cataclysm and Death[]
When the cataclysm struck, Director and Basil were each called away from the Narzissenkreuz Institute to help handle the calamity. With predictions that the Institute would flood over for good, and that there was a high chance that neither would return from their duties, Basil sent the children at the Institute to trusted individuals. Mary-Ann and Alain Guillotin were sent to Emanuel Guillotin, while Rene de Petrichor and Jakob went to Karl Ingold.[4]
To fight Elynas, the Sponsian was repaired and the Fontaine Armada departed for what would be their last battle.[7] They followed Elynas for approximately 35 days, while also attracting monsters from the Abyss. While the ship suffered wreckage again, Basil and her crew pushed on.[9]
Seeing that their hunt would only become more dangerous, Basil had her Second Mate and most of the crew return to safety, leaving only Basil, Pickman, the Chief Engineer, and those who were willing to stay behind. They fought off the monsters that were on the deck, but a machine operated on the Sponsian showed that there were no chances of survival — a premonition which came true, leading to Basil's death.[9]
The Sponsian was broken in half, with one half on the shore and the other inside Elynas' body.

Present[]
Years after her death, people pay respects to Basil's grave, including Dwight, her childhood friend who later became the director of the Institute of Natural Philosophy.[10]
When the Traveler and Paimon encounter the Melusine Ahes, they research about the wreckage of the Sponsian. At some point, the Traveler manages to recount the memories of the ship's final moments before it sank and heard Basil's voice. It turns out that Ahes has earned Basil's trust in taking care of the shipwreck, despite being sorrowful about what happened in the past.[9]

Trivia[]
Basil Elton is the name of the narrator and protagonist of H.P. Lovecraft's short story The White Ship.
The white appearance of her ship, the Sponsian, is likely also in reference to the titular ship in the story.
The name of her First Mate, Nathaniel Pickman, may be a reference to another Lovecraft work, At the Mountains of Madness, in which the expedition recounted in the story was sponsored by the Nathaniel Derby Pickman Foundation. "Pickman" was also a recurring family name in Lovecraft's works, although no character by the name Nathaniel Pickman ever appeared.
The Elton Trench is likely named after her, as this is where the majority of the remains of her flagship, the Sponsian, had sunk.
Basil was the owner of Tidal Shadow.[7]
