Dialogue[]

Nesmil: We have a new wine today. A glass for you?
 What is this place?
Nesmil: This is Djafar Tavern, the best in Port Ormos! Our boss here can get hold of any good wine!
Nesmil: Nearby merchants, tourists, sailors... and my old friends from the Eremites all come here to indulge in drinking from time to time.
Nesmil: And there's also the tasty appetizers. Personally, I think you can have them as meals, even without drinks!
 Old friend of the Eremites?
Nesmil: Hehe, sorry, I don't look like someone who's been in the Eremites, do I?
Nesmil: But I was a veritable mercenary there! I could punch sea monsters in the face!
Nesmil: Well, that was a joke. It's hard to beat a sea monster. But to deal with a couple of drunks, it's as easy as pie.
Nesmil: Even when there's something I can't handle, I have the gorgeous, gentle, and powerful Roshana here.
Nesmil: Anyone who annoys her will come to a bad end.
 Gorgeous... and gentle...
Nesmil: Shh, quiet, don't let her hear you!
Nesmil: Every time I say something like that, she thinks I'm nagging and gives me the cold shoulder. I don't want that.
Nesmil: To be honest, I left the Eremites for here because of Roshana.
Nesmil: She is such a visionary! I enjoy much more freedom here than freelancing for the Akademiya.
Nesmil: But don't tell her I said that. I'll bribe you with some nice cooking!
(Obtain  Fish With Cream Sauce ×3)
 See you.
Nesmil: Take care, and please do come again!
