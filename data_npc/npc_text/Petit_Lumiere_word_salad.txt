Dialogue[]

Petit Lumiere: How about it? Ready to try your hand at filming?
 Yep.
Petit Lumiere: Excellent. I've already set up the scene, the actors are ready, and all is awaiting your arrival.
 About your older brother...
Petit Lumiere: Lumiere is much older than I, but that poses no obstacle to us brothers working together.
Petit Lumiere: We were not yet famous when we filmed "The Arrival of an Aquabus" and "Employees Leaving the Factory."
Petit Lumiere: We two brothers have done everything together, because no one was willing to assist directors who were not yet famous, haha!
Petit Lumiere: If you are interested, you can go see those two films.
 I'm not ready yet.
Petit Lumiere: No problem, I understand. A quality product requires time to incubate and nurture.

Trivia[]
Petit Lumiere and his mentioned older brother are based on the 19th century French filmmaker brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière, known for their short films and the invention of the Cinematograph motion picture film mechanism.
