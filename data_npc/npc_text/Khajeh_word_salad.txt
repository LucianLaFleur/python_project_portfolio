Profile[]
Khajeh was one of the Six Sages of Sumeru Akademiya, representing the Haravatat Darshan. He attempted to enlist Tighnari into the sages' secret project to ascend Scaramouche to godhood by implying that the reputation of his fellow sage and Tighnari's master Naphis was at risk. Tighnari declined, as he believed that if the sages' project was so important Naphis would have come to him personally. In truth, Naphis had been imprisoned by his fellow sages due to his disagreement with the project, so the sages could not directly have him recruit Tighnari.
Khajeh was present during the samsara the sages enacted during the Sabzeruz Festival. After the sages' plans were foiled, Khajeh was one of the four sages who were punished and exiled to the Avidya Forest.
