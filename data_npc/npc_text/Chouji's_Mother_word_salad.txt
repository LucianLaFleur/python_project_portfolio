Chouji's mother originally lived with her son and husband in a village near Jakotsu Mine, where her husband was a miner.[1][3] She worked at Tatarasuna,[4] although her job there has not been disclosed. While they lived together, Chouji's mother taught him how to cook various dishes, including Imported Poultry which they had learned to make from the Fontaine inventor Xavier.[1]
Chouji's father disappeared in the chaos of the war between the Shogun's Army and the Watatsumi Army, while both sides plastered recruitment posters on the wall in front of their home. Chouji's mother often visited local shrines to pray, scattering Sakura Blooms around the shrines as an offering.[5][6] When Chouji's father failed to return home, villagers erected a tombstone for him, much to her anger; Chouji remarks that he had never seen her so angry before.[1]
During the war, the Narukami Pillars on Yashiori Island were destroyed by rogue members of the Watatsumi Army, unleashing the full might of the Tatarigami. The situation on Yashiori Island rapidly deteriorated as villagers and soldiers alike descended into madness,[7] and Chouji's mother was attacked by a villager named Shingo, who believed he was hearing the word of god.[5] Additionally, Chouji's mother was infected by the Tatarigami, but its energies did not corrupt her like it did others, instead flowing freely inside her. However, she was still inflicted with a fever and occasional bleeding, so the doctor Yasumoto referred her to some pirates led by Onitaka to bring her to Sumeru in search for treatment for her condition.[3][8]
Ten days after the rain caused by the Tatarigami started to fall on Yashiori Island, Chouji's mother left the island for Sumeru.[1] She wrote the Unsealed Letter to Chouji to apologize for her abrupt departure, but the letter somehow ended up hidden away in Jakotsu Mine and never reached Chouji.[1] The letter was opened by an unidentified person before the Traveler chances upon it.[9]
Meanwhile, Washizu, the village's head, was driven insane by the Tatarigami. Like Shingo before him, Washizu set his sights on Chouji's mother because "He" was pleased with her. Her departure for Sumeru enraged him, and he rants to the Traveler about how she could not escape from "His" thousands of eyes.[2][10]

Trivia[]
According to Washizu's Incomplete Register, Chouji's mother is around 32 years old.
Assuming that Chouji's mother adopted her husband's surname, her surname would be Zushi (Japanese: 頭師).
