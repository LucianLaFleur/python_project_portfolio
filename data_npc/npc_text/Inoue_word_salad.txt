Dialogue[]

Inoue: Traveler, what business do you have here? No outlanders are allowed to enter.
 Tell me about the headquarters of the Tenryou Commission...
Inoue: The headquarters of the Tenryou Commission is an important Shogunate facility. It maintains law and order across Inazuma, and executes every order from the Almighty Shogun.
Inoue: As such, it is my duty to interrogate every person coming in and out. Those who cannot explain their identity and intentions shall not enter.
 Have you ever seen someone who looks like me?
(Before completing Transient Dreams)

Inoue: Hmm? An outlander? I have never seen one. We rarely have outlanders coming in. I would have remembered, had I seen one.
(After completing Transient Dreams)

Inoue: Hmm? An outlander? Nope. I mean, I would have remembered, had I seen one."
Inoue: Please go to the Hanamizaka Police Station if you mean to lodge a report about a missing person.
 Goodbye.
Inoue: Goodbye. Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign! Please don't come back if you have no business here.
