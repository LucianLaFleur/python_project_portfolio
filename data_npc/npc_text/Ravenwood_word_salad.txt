Trivia[]
Ravenwood may be the Knight of Boreas mentioned in Wolf's Gravestone, who is said to have stopped wandering upon reaching the City of Mondstadt, much like how the Knights of Favonius were joined by the Knight of Boreas after Mondstadt's liberation from the aristocracy.[2] However, there is currently too little information to be certain.
