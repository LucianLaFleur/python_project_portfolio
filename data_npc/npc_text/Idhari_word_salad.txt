Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies.


Idhari: If someone can find an answer, that person is definitely me.
 An answer to what?
Idhari: The biggest problem before me, the answer I seek is... Yes, it is The Withering.
Idhari: The issue of The Withering has been growing in severity lately, and it's spreading even more rapidly and further now.
Idhari: There aren't many who have Visions, so relying on them to resolve it won't really work.
Idhari: So, it's my time to shine. It's my time to eliminate The Withering from its source!
Idhari: Hehe, my reputation in the Akademiya will definitely rise once I've resolved such a major problem, and I may even get to be a sage!
 See you.
Idhari: Just wait and see! I'll definitely succeed.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies.


Idhari: New topic... a new topic... *sigh* Agh, come on!
 What do you mean "new topic"?
Idhari: Do you know what we researchers fear the most?
Idhari: We fear the loss of research direction, that's what!
Idhari: Perhaps my luck is just terrible, but there is presently no need to pursue the topic that I was originally looking into.
Idhari: And here I was looking to make a name for myself by solving a major problem... and would you look at that? It's all come to nothing!
Idhari: This should be a time of opportunity! Four out of our six sage seats are empty! And here I am...
Idhari: No. No, I can't give up just yet. They're not just going to flip a coin and pick a sage just like that!
Idhari: As long as I can find a research topic more important and with more potential than the last, I've still got a chance...
 See you.
Idhari: Yes. I'm not going to give up now!
