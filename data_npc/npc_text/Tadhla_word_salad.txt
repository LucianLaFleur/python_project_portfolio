Profile[]
Tadhla was the daughter of Masseira, trained to become a Falcon of the tribe. After the Traveler was welcomed as a guest, Masseira asked them to help find Tadhla. The Traveler found Tadhla in a Fatui camp, having been ambushed by them and caught in the process. Driving the Fatui away, Masseira was disappointed in her inability to focus as a Falcon, but nonetheless continued with her coming-of-age ceremony.
The next day, Masseira asked the Traveler to accompany Tadhla on her hunt, which consisted of the three Consecrated Beasts — a Red Vulture, Scorpion and Flying Serpent. While hunting the scorpion, Tadhla and the Traveler were caught off guard by a second scorpion which injured her, forcing the Traveler to tackle the Flying Serpent alone. After preparing the items, they returned to Masseira, who then gave her the next hunt — the Traveler themselves.
Tadhla confronted the Traveler at the ruins of Gurabad, where she fought them as a Falcon as they were to see them as potential prey. The Traveler fought back in self-defense, defeating her, upon which she asked them not to forget her. Liloupar interpreted her final words as her choice of no longer living as a Falcon, but a friend instead. They picked up her feather, implying that she had died after the fight.

Appearance[]
Tadhla takes on the appearance of an Eremite Galehunter.

Dialogue[]

(After finishing the quest The Falcon's Hunt, near Masseira's hut)
Tadhla: (Tadhla avoids eye contact and lowers her head nervously).
 Are you alright?
Tadhla: Sorry, the hunt is over. I am Father's "Falcon."
Tadhla: But I'm feeling great. Don't worry about me.

 About your relationship with Masseira...
Tadhla: As I said, he is my father, and I am his Falcon. I follow his orders. I hunt for him, risk my life for him, as he is the will of the Tanit.
Tadhla: When the day comes that I cannot fully execute my Father's orders, then my life as a Falcon will end.

(Continue from previous dialogue set)
 That's pretty extreme...
Tadhla: Extreme, huh? I'm not sure about that. I've always lived like this ever since I was a child.
 Haven't you ever thought about living for yourself?
Tadhla: ...
Tadhla: No. Never. I never had such thoughts, or expectations.
Tadhla: The desert is a place of indifference and brutality, where I have no time to think for my own good. Without me, my tribe lives on just the same. However, without my tribe, there is no way I will survive.
Tadhla: Well... But, the stories of you and Paimon, and the adventures that you two experienced...
Tadhla: Should there be a chance, I would really want to hear more of them.
Paimon: No problem! We have tons of stories to tell!
 Yes, I'll tell you all of them.
 We can talk about them any time you want.
Tadhla: Pfft...
Tadhla: Ahem, sorry. I'm just very happy. Thank you, the Master of the Jinni. Um, I mean, thank you, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).

(After finding the Red Vulture's lair)
Tadhla: (...Don't think about it too much, Tadhla, you're just a Falcon...)
(At the Serpent's Cave, when Tadhla sits this fight out)
Tadhla: (...So thirsty... and hurting... and cold...)
(After defeating the Serpent, while collecting Liloupar's fragment)
Tadhla: (...I must not show weakness, or look afraid...)
