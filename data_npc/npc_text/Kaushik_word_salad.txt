 What this totem means...
Media:VO Kaushik 01.ogg "Yes, that must be what this totem means."

Dialogue[]

Kaushik: Ah, so that's how it is. You know what? I think that what this needs is an even more daring hypothesis!
 What are you doing?
Kaushik: I'm a scholar from Sumeru, and I'm currently researching Watatsumi Island's culture and history.
Kaushik: I was here before the Sakoku Decree was declared, and I have remained here till now. In this time, I have discovered huge differences between Watatsumi Island and Narukami Island.
Kaushik: For example, have a look at this totem that I dug up from ruins in the wild. Studying these lines and patterns has led me to a marvelous conclusion!
 And what are your conclusions?
Kaushik: My conclusion is that ancient Inazuma must have played host to two snake gods!
Kaushik: One of them was enjoined with coral and could not move, thus creating Sangonomiya Shrine. Its true divine form dwelled within Enkanomiya deep below, forever defending the people of Watatsumi Island.
Kaushik: As for the other snake god, it was a most ambitious being that dreamed of invading Narukami Island, but was cut down by the Electro Archon as it was making its way there.
Kaushik: See? This totem shows snake patterns with coral on them on one end, and patterns that completely lack them on the other. And that's how you know this is the truth!
Kaushik: Very reasonable, is it not? Once I publish my conclusions, I'll be famous! Hahaha!
 Are you sure of your conclusions?
Kaushik: Of course. A researcher must always persist in their views. For instance, it doesn't matter how much everyone thinks that Mondstadt only has The Four Winds. Well, I reckon that there are five!
Kaushik: My hypothesis is flawless!
Kaushik: That shrine maiden at the Sangonomiya Shrine may shake her head at my conclusions, but it is she who has been blinded by her faith.
Kaushik: I mean, it's not like she has any evidence to show me herself, does she?
 Well, see you around.
Kaushik: Goodbye. Ha, my conclusions must be correct!

Trivia[]
Kaushik's erroneous conclusion about two snake gods is based on Byakuyakoku's worship of two serpent gods: the coral-adorned serpent Orobashi and the scaleless serpent Ouroboros. However, Ouroboros is just a product of imagination to describe the space phenomenon at The Serpent's Heart,[1] which invalidates Kaushik's claim.
Alternatively, the snake with corals represents Orobashi's original appearance, while the snake without corals depicts its appearance after shedding its coral to create Watatsumi Island.
Kaushik's "five Four Winds" theory is derived from a Chinese and Japanese internet meme that roughly translates to "The five members of the Four Heavenly Kings" (Chinese: 四天王有五人). It parodies a recurring theme in East Asian cultures where famous legendary and/or historical group names include a certain number of members, but the actual number of members adds one more.[2]
Etymology[]
Kaushik (Hindi: कौशिक) is an Indian surname and a gotra (male lineage) named after the Brahmarshi (highest sage) Vishvamitra.
