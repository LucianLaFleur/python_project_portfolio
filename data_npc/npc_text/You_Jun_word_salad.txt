Dialogue[]

You Jun: Shh! Shh! (‍HeHeText for male Traveler/SheSheText for female Traveler‍)'s here! The blond-haired [sic] Traveler! Indeed, it is just as Master Taliesin sang of.
 You talk like a bard.
You Jun: "Like" nothing! I shall soon be a bard, for sooth!
You Jun: Thanks to you, this place no longer requires the services of so many Millelith.
You Jun: I should have been transferred back to Liyue Harbor, but I've found what I want to do.
You Jun: And what is that, you ask? Why, it is to follow Master Taliesin and cause songs and ballads to resound on the winds throughout Liyue.
 Master Taliesin?
You Jun: That's right. His "old school epic poetry" really moved me. As such, I've decided to become his very first disciple here in Liyue. I feel like I should also write an epic for Rex Lapis.
 Heh, that was awkward.
You Jun: That's what I think too... Still, I'll work hard under Master Taliesin!
 See you then, raven-haired You Jun.
You Jun: Indeed. Farewell, gold-haired Traveler.
