Profile[]
Yabe is a Sangonomiya Samurai in the Stingray III Squad of the Watatsumi Army. He was fond of horror stories since he was a child.[1]  He is deeply invested in the legend of the "Bunkoku Enigma," but is aware that endeavoring to uncover the mystery may be perilous. As a result, while he entreats the Traveler to help him investigate it, he withholds information until they ascertain that there is some truth to the legend.[2]

Appearance[]
Yabe wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, consisting of a light red-white gradient shitagi with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray kobakama, and waraji sandals without socks. His uniform features a sode (shoulder armor), han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it.

Yabe: First the darkness, then monsters, then patrol missions... Guess we're not going anywhere else any time soon.
Yabe: Maybe I'll go for a little adventure in the Dainichi Mikoshi when we change shifts.
