Dialogue[]

Mozhgan: Hmm... I should still have enough stock at home.
 Stock of what?
Mozhgan: Sumeru Rose, Mint, Nilotpala Lotus, and the like.
Mozhgan: Don't underestiamte those small plants. You'll benefit greatly if you know how to use them.
Mozhgan: For example, your face will glow if you mash Sumeru Rose in water, and apply the mixture onto your face!
Mozhgan: So listen to me and always keep Sumeru roses in the house.
 Does it actually work?
Mozhgan: Well... in my experience, it'll help at least a little bit.
Mozhgan: Anyway, it won't hurt to give it a shot. Just try your luck.
(Obtain  Sumeru Rose ×4)
 See you.
Mozhgan: Yeah, see you.
