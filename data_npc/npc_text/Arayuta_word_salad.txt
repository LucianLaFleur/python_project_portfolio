(Talk to Arayuta)
Arayuta: Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), you are as valiant as Nara Varuna in the stories!
Arayuta: This time, Aradashan and I won't help you suppress the power of Bulky Iron Chunk. It will be more like the Bulky Iron Chunk in the stories. Worry not, Arasata and Arasaha will still help you!
Arayuta: So, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), what do you say?
 Sure.
Arayuta: I'm sure you'll do fine, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)!
 I'll need to prepare first.
Arayuta: Okay... Tell me once you are ready!
(Fight the Bulky Iron Chunk)
(Talk to Arayuta after defeating the Bulky Iron Chunk)
Arayuta: Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) is awesome. If it's Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), even the mighty Bulky Iron Chunk from the legends can be defeated!
Arayuta: Come to Arayuta, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), if you want to challenge the Bulky Iron Chunk with two stacks of Ararakalari lifted.
Arayuta: Do you wish to fight again?
 Let's go for one more round!
Arayuta: So happy to see Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) fight again!
 Not now.
Arayuta: Okay, tell me if you wish to try again!
