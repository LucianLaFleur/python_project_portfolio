Najib's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Najib is a member of the Eremites who is currently near The Chasm, and is one of the three most recent witnesses of the Sumpter Beastlord. He claims he is traveling to Liyue from Sumeru and managed to sneak by the creature while it was sleeping. However, he becomes defensive when asked why he is traveling through the more dangerous land route through The Chasm instead of going over water, claiming personal reasons.[1]
Najib is actually working with Treasure Hoarders in the region and has given them the location of a chest buried in the hills of Avidya Forest, near The Chasm.[2]

Appearance[]
Najib wears the tan clothes and red scarf and headband of a Eremite Ravenbeak Halberdier. He has brown hair.
