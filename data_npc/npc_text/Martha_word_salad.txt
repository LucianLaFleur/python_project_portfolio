Idle Quotes[]

 Can we trust him...
Media:VO Martha 01.ogg This visitor from Sumeru seems awfully suspicious... Can we really trust him?

Dialogue[]

Martha: That suspicious guy from Sumeru... *sigh* I should keep Moce a bit farther away from him...
 And you are...
Martha: Hmm? Ah, welcome, guests from afar. I'm Martha Pasquale, the matron of Pasquale's Instruments.
Martha: If you have any musical instruments you'd like to order, you can go straight to my husband, Giovanni.
 A suspicious person from Sumeru, you say?
Martha: Ah yes, that guy over there. The name's... Chan... something? Ugh. I don't remember exactly, but it was hard to pronounce.
Martha: He came into town some time back, claiming to be a researcher from Sumeru. Well, I've never seen him do any research. He just plays cards all day with the Doge's granddaughter...
Martha: Can't figure out half the things he talks about normally either. "Moving statues" this, "voices in the walls" that... *sigh* Maybe we should get Ms. Contarini to investigate him...
 And Moce is...?
Martha: *sigh* My mischievous son. Sorry if he's given you any trouble.
Martha: That boy's been a restless soul since Giovanni told him about how his uncle sailed off to Sumeru. That's what you get when you fill a child's head with dreams of adventure...
Martha: But what if one of those suspicious Sumeru folk reel him in, and then, and then... Ah! No, no, how horrifying! I can't bear the thought!
