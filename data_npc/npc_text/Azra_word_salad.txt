Media:VO Azra All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Azra: (I want to watch Nilou dance!)

Dialogue[]

Azra: When will I be able to see Nilou perform again?
 About Nilou...
Azra: Let me tell you, Zubayr Theater's Nilou is the best dancer ever.
Azra: Many may be able to dance beautifully, but Nilou is unique in the way she infuses emotions into her dance.
Azra: It took me a long time to snap out of such a feeling after watching her performance. It's so...
 That feeling?
Azra: Just like water!
Azra: I mean, pure water can be shaped into different forms, boiled, or frozen...
Azra: *sigh* If I weren't assigned as a guard here, I would like to watch her perform every day.
(Obtain  Varunada Lazurite Fragment ×1)
 See you.
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Azra: *sigh* Why doesn't the Akademiya like theaters?
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
Azra: The ban on the arts has been lifted, so we should be able to watch more performances now...
