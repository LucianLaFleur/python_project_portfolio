Story[]
The Conductor first met with the Sojourner, and later the Dawnlight Swordswoman and Kreuzlied, with whom he formed the Wanderer's Troupe.
As a group they both performed music and fought against the oppressive Aristocracy. As part of the Troupe, the Conductor wielded The Widsith. Their final act was to storm the City of Mondstadt in an attempt to overthrow the Aristocracy. They failed, however, and the Conductor died in battle.
