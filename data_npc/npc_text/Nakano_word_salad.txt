Appearance[]
Nakano wears a standard uniform modeled from the ashigaru (Japanese: 足軽) of feudal Japan. He wears a purple-gray shitagi, lavender kobakama, white socks, and waraji sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with pale gold accents consists of dou (breastplate) with the Inazuma Shogunate's crest, kote (armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves). He is equipped with a juumonji yari (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead.

Idle Quotes[]

 What they call eternity...
Media:VO Nakano 01.ogg "The sea and the sun, rising day after day... *sigh* I guess this is what they call eternity."

Dialogue[]

Nakano: Ah, hello. How may I help you?
 Are you enjoying the view?
Nakano: Yes. I enjoy watching this ocean and the sunshine every day.
Nakano: You're still young, so you probably don't know yet. The scenery you'll see in your 40s won't really be that much different from the stuff you're seeing in your 20s.
Nakano: Seeing how the sun rises from the east, sets in the west, and how the tides flow this way and that, I feel like I can understand the Eternity that the Almighty Shogun is pursuing...
 Eternity...
Nakano: I'm just a commoner. How could I possibly comprehend eternity as the Almighty Shogun conceives it? I am probably overstepping.
Nakano: But I'm already half a century old, and yet I'm still a regular samurai like when I was young. I still can't help but feel sorry for this ordinary life I've led.
Nakano: Looking back on it now, those fights I got into when I was young were really pointless. I'd rather spend the rest of my short, ordinary life just by watching this ocean...
 But I can't stop here.
Nakano: Ahh, it seems like you still have unfulfilled wishes, young Traveler.
Nakano: Well... It's good that you have aspirations that drive you.
Nakano: This bow was given to me by a friend when I was still young... However, I've never had the chance to use it.
Nakano: I don't think it'll do me any good, so I'll give it to you. If it can help you in your journey, then it has served its purpose.
(Obtain 3★  Recurve Bow)
 Goodbye.
Nakano: Um, goodbye. Enjoy your life.
