Simurgh was originally a shard of Khvarena that was formed from Nabu Malikata, who then gave it to Greater Lord Rukkhadevata so that she could protect it. Nabu Malikata foresaw the coming of the cataclysm and Simurgh's eventual sacrifice. After Nabu Malikata and King Deshret died, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata turned the Khvarena into a divine bird. She charged Simurgh with the "guardianship of the border between new birth and death." Simurgh slumbered until the disaster arrived. The Amrita is made of the remains of Egeria, the previous Hydro Archon, after she was slain during the upheaval, but it quickly began to be corrupted by the Abyss. In order to save the Amrita, Simurgh flew into the pool and shattered its form, becoming countless motes of Khvarena.[1] The sentient Khvarena became the Pari.[2]

Etymology[]
In Zoroastrianism, the Harvisptokhm  is the "tree of all seeds" that grows within the cosmic sea, the Vourukasha. Within it grows the Gaokerena, or "White Haoma", and the Simurgh lives atop the tree, spreading the seeds.
