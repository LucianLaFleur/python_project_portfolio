Mr. Doesn't-Know-How-Lucky-He-Is (by Smiley Yanxiao)




  Open-World NPCs 




Jiangxue (Chinese: 江雪 Jiāngxuě) is an open-world NPC in Liyue. He can be found near the Wangshu Inn in Dihua Marsh.
Allegedly a fisherman, it is quickly apparent that he's simply fishing to wile away his time, choosing this peaceful lifestyle to repent for the "bad things" he's done.
Following a certain dialogue branch for the first time gives the player five Fish.

Jiangxue's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Jiangxue is much more powerful than he appears. He once held a Vision, which he has since discarded after doing "bad things" with it. Even without a Vision or even a weapon, he can sense when and where monsters will appear, and singlehandedly takes down a Ruin Hunter within seconds without seemingly moving.[1]
His past is vaguely alluded to; Smiley Yanxiao has known him for a long time and claims that he is the only person willing to give him food following a mysterious incident in Jiangxue's past. Jiangxue also admits to the Traveler that he once went to Dihua Marsh to do "bad things," but that those things were also something he "had to do."[2] Following the aftermath of that event, Jiangxue discarded his original name and his Vision, then took up his current alias. His past seems to weigh heavily upon him, as he mentions that he is "still unable to wholly let go" and that he has not released a Xiao Lantern of his own for "a long time."[3]
At some point prior to his current predicament, he helped someone with a problem who invited him to a feast in gratitude, where he learned the Chicken Tofu Pudding recipe, although he was unable to make it for himself. He would later teach it to the Traveler and Smiley Yanxiao.
In the quests Fishing Jiangxue and Yanxiao's Crazy Kitchen, Jiangxue can be found slightly northeast of Wangshu Inn, in Dihua Marsh, on a small islet that has several stone beast statues in a circular formation. These statues are not discussed in dialogue, but it is possible that they were formerly adepti who asked Rex Lapis to turn their bodies to stone after the Archon War.[4] It is currently unclear what significance this area has and why Jiangxue can be found near these statues.

Dialogue[]

Jiangxue: The inn is straight up there. Oh, you want to chat? Keep your voice down then, don't scare the fish away.
 Who are you?
Jiangxue: I'm just a guy with a fishing rod and plenty of time on my hands.
Jiangxue: You really want to get on a first-name basis, huh? ...I stopped using my real name a long time ago.
Jiangxue: Just call me Jiangxue.
 I want to go fishing too!
Jiangxue: You have far more important things to do.
Jiangxue: You don't want to follow in my footsteps. I'm just waiting around for my life to come to an end.
Jiangxue: Reason being, I did what I had to do, and now it's done.
 What did you have to do?
Jiangxue: I think you already know the answer to that. Because like you, I used to be one of the chosen ones in this world.
Jiangxue: The difference is, I used my power to do some bad things.
Jiangxue: I gave up my Vision. I'm not worthy of it anymore, nor do I have any real use for it.
 Are you a fisherman?
Jiangxue: No, you misunderstand. I don't fish for a living.
Jiangxue: Neither the process nor result of fishing means anything to me. But it does help to pass the time a little quicker.
Jiangxue: If you want fish, you can just have them.
(Obtain  Fish ×5)
 Goodbye.
Jiangxue: Goodbye.

Event Dialogue[]
Moonlight Merriment[]

(After completing Part II: Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go)
Jiangxue: Ah, so Yanxiao came in second this year. A shame, but also not a bad thing.
Jiangxue: Cooking is much like martial arts. One can only improve when rivals [sic] to compete with.
Jiangxue: I'll bet that he's cooking up some new recipes as we speak. Well, I sure hope I'll get to try some of it.

Trivia[]
Jiangxue is mentioned in Teyvat Travel Guide - Liyue as "that fisherman from the inn" who sat on Alice's seashell necklace, crushing them under his "merciless buttocks" and injuring himself in the process, forcing her to pay his medical bills.
Etymology[]
In Chinese, Jiangxue's name can be translated as "River Snow"  (Chinese: 江雪). The inspiration behind his name and his related Daily Commission, Fishing Jiangxue, is a reference to a poem written by the Tang Dynasty poet Liu Zongyuan, also titled 江雪 Jiāngxuě. The relevant lines read, "In a lone boat, an old man, in rain hat and straw raincoat / Fishing alone, in the cold river snow"  (Chinese: 孤舟蓑笠翁，独钓寒江雪 gūzhōu suōlǐ-wēng, dúdiào hán jiāngxuě).
