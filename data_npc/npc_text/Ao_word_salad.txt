Ao is a representative image of the blue oni race in the Inazuma fairy tales. He, along with his crimson oni friend Aka, tries to live in harmony with humans at the contract of Raiden Shogun.
Aka's initial attempts to interact with humans ended in failure, but he still wished to befriend them. Ao proposed a solution in which he would perform "evil" acts and have Aka scare him off. The plan worked and Aka began to happily interact with humans. Seeing this, Ao left. Eventually, Aka searched for Ao; upon realizing that Ao was purposely avoiding him because Ao didn't want humans to misunderstand that Aka is corrupt too, Aka left behind a letter and they reunited during a village festival, albeit away from the village.
Nowadays, the blue oni race has always maintained their pride and lived far away from humans, also because of that they have many difficulties in their quality of life, such as Takuya and his family. However, thanks to the care and goodwill of the red oni race's descendant, Arataki Itto, the blue oni race has gradually comes to light and reintegrated into society.

In principle, though, I'm absolutely against it. No one should have to sacrifice their own kind for the sake of a better tomorrow, period. It's only a better tomorrow if it's a better tomorrow for everyone. We need to work together, not have everyone just focused on themselves, making their own sacrifice, trying to look cool in the process... Eh, I guess there's no changing the past, what's done is done. But from this day forward, no more sacrificing, not on my watch! You go to sacrifice yourself, I'll stand right in your way!
