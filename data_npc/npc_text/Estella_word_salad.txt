Dialogue[]

Estella: The hearth in your home has been burning brightly lately, I see.
Olivier: And the balances in yours have been working hard, haven't they?
Manet: My hearth is strong, and the firewood, sufficient. As for the balances, I don't need 'em. It's not like I'll miss those one or two pieces of vegetables at the market, anyway.
Estella: ...
Estella: You'd best be careful. If the flames leap onto the opera house carpet, they'll put your hearth out while fighting the fires.
Olivier: Ooh, very scary. But can you guarantee that the opera house would survive said flames?
Manet: Nah, the fire in my house won't reach the opera house. It's way too far away!
Olivier: ...
Estella: ...So, have those flames been staying put?
Olivier: Hmph. Why don't you guess?
Estella: I'm not doing that. Just tell me.
Manet: I bet they're behaving themselves instead. Where can they go, anyway?
Olivier: ...
Estella: ...
