Augustus Lovelace: (The structure of ships here in Sumeru is interesting indeed...)
Dialogue[]

Augustus Lovelace: The structure of ships here in Sumeru is interesting indeed. Hmm, inspiring, too...
 What are you doing?
Augustus Lovelace: Oh, it's you. I was just studying the ships here at Port Sumeru.
Augustus Lovelace: Though Raimondo is likely going to order a "reorganization" of my project... which really means terminate.
Augustus Lovelace: But I've spent too long on this research to just let it go.
Augustus Lovelace: I couldn't help but start to compare the differences in design between these ships and aquabuses...
 What is an aquabus?
Augustus Lovelace: In Fontaine, a kind of transportation system called aquarails.
Augustus Lovelace: Aquabuses are dedicated vehicles that use them.
Augustus Lovelace: If you ever find yourself in Fontaine, you should definitely ride one.
Augustus Lovelace: Not only are they fast and convenient, but they even have Melusine guides on board who will provide commentary on the scenery.
Augustus Lovelace: I swear, I am not exaggerating in the least when I say that riding an aquabus is simply a sublime experience.
 Your travels...
Augustus Lovelace: Nothing special, really. I could have come directly to Sumeru from Fontaine... after all, there's a line going straight to the Bayda Harbor in Sumeru.
Augustus Lovelace: But to make the trip a bit more interesting, I went to Liyue via Lumidouce Harbor and Chenyu Vale.
Augustus Lovelace: After that, I took a ferry to Port Ormos from Liyue Harbor. Then I traveled northwards along the river, and here I am.
Augustus Lovelace: When I return, I may trek across the desert, and return via Romaritime Harbor.
Augustus Lovelace: ...However, I have plenty of Mora left, so crossing the desert to Natlan sounds nice, too...
 See you.
Augustus Lovelace: Goodbye, then. I'll continue my observations. Fascinating, indeed...

Trivia[]
