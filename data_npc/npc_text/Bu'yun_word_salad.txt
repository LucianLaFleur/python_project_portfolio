Bu'yun: Looks like I got the edge on this one.
(If the player wins the match)

Bu'yun: I didn't expect you to be so good at cards. What a disgrace.
 Could you take us up to the Jade Chamber?
Bu'yun: You perceive the mansion, but not the moon, and it is not in my power to bring them to you. Please await another opportunity.
 It's nothing.
Bu'yun: Go well, then.

 How are the people at the Jade Chamber doing?
Bu'yun: It's all thanks to the help of the adepti and Lady Ningguang's brilliant planning...
Bu'yun: The secretaries, maids and guards of the Jade Chamber are all safe and sound, and are at present well-settled in Liyue Harbor.
Bu'yun: If you wish to meet Lady Ningguang...
Bu'yun: I'm afraid that she is occupied by administrative tedium, and cannot meet you presently.
 What about the Jade Chamber?
Bu'yun: Sadly, the Jade Chamber, which once blotted out the sun and moon, has now been swallowed up by the waves of the Sea of Clouds.
Bu'yun: They say that seasons come and seasons go, and that all things must rise and fall. Thus it is with the ancient gods, and so it is with mortal works. There is nothing there to mourn.
Bu'yun: So they say. But still, I cannot help but sigh when I consider the fate of the Jade Chamber...
Bu'yun: To sacrifice the work she had carved with her own hands over so many years...
Bu'yun: And to do so without hesitation or regrets...
Bu'yun: Lady Ningguang's strategems are beyond my ability to grasp...
 Goodbye.
Bu'yun: Take care, honored guest.

Dialogue Set #3[]

 Excuse me, do you sell the moon here?
Bu'yun: Ah, so it's you. It's been a while.
Bu'yun: I remember that you were the guest who used the Yuheng's code before, and you also helped us rebuild the Jade Chamber. I remember you well.
Bu'yun: Please, this way. Ascend to the Chamber.
 No need.
Bu'yun: Go well, then.
