 Don't need a goal...
Media:VO Fleicher 01.ogg "Life can be so much more fun when you don't have a goal! Y—You just do things!"

Dialogue[]

Fleicher: ...I see, I see. If not for you adventurers seeing it with your own eyes, everyone might still have the wrong idea!
Persone: That's what I love about adventure. You can personally investigate things you're interested in and obtain the most reliable information possible.
Persone: More importantly, I do what I do because I want to, and not because of some duty that someone else has imposed on me.
Fleicher: *sigh* Say no more, say no more. I know what you're telling me to do. And in truth, you've moved me, you have.
Fleicher: My problem is my all-too-consuming sense of responsibility. The moment I pick work up, I have to see it through.
Fleicher: But you've made me understand that something as lacking in aim and security as adventuring can, in truth, be so enjoyable!
Fleicher: Looks like I really should consider how I can change my busy life at the Palais Mermonia.
