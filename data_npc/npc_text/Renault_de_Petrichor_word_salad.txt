Story[]
After the purge of Fleuve Cendre, Eduardo and other survivors were exiled to the desert. They were later rescued by Eduardo's henchmen. They then took members of Maison Gardiennage hostage and occupied Poisson with comrades active near Mont Automnequi. This is where his son Jakob met Renault's son Rene de Petrichor.[1]
Before the Siege of Poisson, the reporter Karl Ingold took a photograph of Eduardo, Jakob, mayor Renault, Rene, "Parsifal", Rosa Reed and her husband Thompson with their infant, and Tom Alter.[1]
Emanuel Guillotin initiated the Siege of Poisson, resulting in bloodshed that presumably led to the deaths of Renault and his wife.[3][4]
Meanwhile, Jakob and Rene were sent to the Narzissenkreuz Institute  and became close friends with Alain and Mary-Ann.[5][6]
After the cataclysm, at the "sites where battles took place", likely near the remains of Elynas, Jakob and Rene coincidentally encountered Alain and Mary-Ann. Alain and Mary-Ann had been adopted by Emanuel Guillotin and became siblings. They were searching for inspiration under Emanuel's watchful eyes at that time. Rene chose not to tell them about Jakob, as he did not trust Emanuel, who was a former Marechaussee Hunter involved in the Siege of Poisson.[7]
