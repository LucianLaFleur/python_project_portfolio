Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Sania: *sigh* This is so frustrating...
 Adventure Challenge

(If the player loses the match)

Sania: That was a tough round... Do you think I've got what it takes to be a pro?
(If the player wins the match)

Sania: Ugh... I still need more training!
 Are you alright?
Sania: Today, perhaps. Tomorrow? I'm afraid we can't be sure.
Sania: With a husband like mine, we're struggling to make ends meet every day.
Sania: I mean, I'm not demanding that he earn huge sums or anything, but I'd at least like a steady income.
Sania: But apart from cooking, he can't do anything at all.
Sania: And everyone here in Aaru Village knows how to cook their own food. It's how we survive here... So who's going to buy food off the street?
Sania: And even that would still be acceptable... But not only does he make no attempt to earn Mora, he gives out the food he makes to others! For free!
 How about talking it out with him?
Sania: I've tried talking, and I've tried scolding.
Sania: You know, he even considered leaving the village to look for some work, but then he claimed he'd miss home... or that he was sensitive to the humidity...
Sania: In the end, he just can't bear to leave me here alone in the village. And what am I supposed to do about that?
Sania: He's a good man. He's so good, he would spend our Mora on helping others.
Sania: I'm not saying that helping others is bad, but we need to look out for ourselves first, right?
 See you.
Sania: See you. Let me see if I can save some Mora on our expenditures anywhere else...

Nighttime[]

Sania: Hmmm. It seems that this is all the Mora I have at the moment...
Sania: Ugh. How am I supposed to live like this?
Jabari: Hey, hey. Relax. Relax...
Jabari: Come on now. I've done some handiwork recently and got plenty of food in return, didn't I?
Sania: And so what? You want us to go on living from hand to mouth like this? What are we going to do when those menial jobs stop making us Mora?
Sania: I'm not going to just watch that happen, unlike you!
Sania: *sigh* Sometimes I wonder if I'm the only one in this family who actually worries about our future here...
