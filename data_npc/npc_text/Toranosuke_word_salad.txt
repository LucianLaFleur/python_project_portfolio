Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(During Tatara Tales)
Toranosuke: Is there something I can help you with?
 What's all this "Mikage Furnace" and "Tatarigami" talk?
Toranosuke: It's just a small problem. We need a little time to sort out...
Toranosuke: You're an adventurer, aren't you? This place isn't suitable for you or your ilk. Get out of here.

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After completing "The Seventh Samurai")
Toranosuke: Mr. Xavier, do we need to keep filming?
Xavier: But of course! There are so many more topics out there waiting for us!
 Are you guys still "filming"?
Xavier: Ahh... If it isn't you, my gallant (‍heroheroText for Aether/heroineheroineText for Lumine‍)!
Xavier: I'm discussing what to film next with this soldier over here.
Xavier: I want to document the legends of the tanuki and the kitsune. But as for our good soldier...
Toranosuke: Well, I recommend that you head into the city and capture the might of our samurai on film, Mr. Xavier.
 So, have you guys reached a conclusion?
Xavier: Hmm... I suppose we've reached a common understanding after ample discussion.
Xavier: And that is to... make a "film" that includes both elements.
Xavier: The story I have in my head is that of a samurai slaying monsters and demons in Inazuma in ages past!
Xavier: And of course, there shall also be the most quintessential elements of love and comedy...
Xavier: However, this is just a preliminary thought. I still have much material to gather.
 See you.
Xavier: Alright then. Farewell, my fair (‍heroheroText for Aether/heroineheroineText for Lumine‍), I wish you only the best of luck!
