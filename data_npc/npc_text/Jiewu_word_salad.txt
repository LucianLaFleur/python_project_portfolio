 Quite fascinating...
Media:VO Jiewu 01.ogg "Now, this is where the story gets quite fascinating."

Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Jiewu: As for what storytellers should talk about, on and off the stage... Well, there are tricks to that trade...
 Not planning on going into more detail?
Jiewu: Please, please, why the hurry? Allow me to prepare first — we'll talk seriously tonight!
Jiewu: I do have some other folktales I can tell you now, though.
 Such as?
Jiewu: For example, a certain merchant from Fontaine was invited to tea during his visit to Qiaoying Village. As soon as the water entered the teapot, he poured it into the cups without waiting and gulped it down, praising its rich aroma...
Jiewu: Little did he know that it was merely the water used to rinse the tea set... and the rich aroma he spoke of? That was just the remnants of the last pot of tea.
Jiewu: Seeing this, the host did not embarrass the merchant and took a few sips as well. After that, the host brewed a pot of fine tea and offered it to the merchant.
 Is that it?
Jiewu: There was also a poet from Mondstadt who had a drinking contest with a few young men in the village.
Jiewu: One young man's home-brewed rice wine was sweet and smooth. The poet drank several bowls in succession, and he was in such high spirits, it seemed to him like he'd uncovered the secrets of the world!
Jiewu: He elbowed his way through the crowd and began to scribble furiously. But as a chilling gust swept past, the poet was stunned for a moment, only to topple over with a resonant thump.
Jiewu: Once he sobered up and took a look at the "secrets of the world" he'd attained the previous night, the first sentence began thus — "Peel apples before eating them."
 (Applaud and keep listening)
Jiewu: Ahem... But I usually don't tell such stories in places like this. At most, I tell them in small teahouses and avoid crowded restaurants...
Jiewu: This way, I can tell my stories comfortably, and everyone feels comfortable listening to them.
Jiewu: Otherwise, some old fool would start nagging me, and what would I do then?
Jiewu: Haha, what am I doing, making my skills in storytelling sound so terrible that I can only make ends meet by resorting to unorthodox methods...
Jiewu: Why, if I applied myself, I would be better than anyone! But doing it every day is just, you know, exhausting!
Jiewu: Comfort is everything in life!
 Maybe next time.
Jiewu: Take care now!

Nighttime[]

Jiewu: They say that the Carp in Chenyu Vale are intelligent... And the stories about them are quite fascinating...
 (Listen in)
Jiewu: ...Just as the raging waves were about to swallow Chenyu Vale, the Millelith Sergeant in command ordered the weapons, armor, and shields to be put together to form numerous ladders...
Jiewu: The Millelith held the ladders together with their arms, single-minded in their determination to help the people climb up and away, completely disregarding their own safety.
Jiewu: Just then, a melodic splash of water resounded through the mountains! A piece of jade emerged from the clouds, surged forward through the waves, and overtook them!
 (Keep listening)
Jiewu: In just an instant, the exquisite jade grew in opposition to the waves, and just a moment later, it was the size of a mountain, crashing into the valley!
Jiewu: They say a series of "clinks," like jade pieces striking against each other, echoed from shore to shore...
Jiewu: Clink! The waves subsided! Clink! The water stabilized! And Clunk! The waters fled back through the mountains like tea being sipped away...
 (Stop listening)
Jiewu: As they say...
