 Rather than asking...

Media:VO Hazm All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Hazm: (I can hear footsteps... Are there still more students coming to me with their questions?)

Dialogue[]

Hazm: It's so difficult for students to buckle down nowadays.
 Hello.
Hazm: *sigh* Hi, you got any questions? Go ahead.
Hazm: Hmm? You are not a student here to ask questions?
Hazm: That's great.
 Can't students ask some questions?
Hazm: Of course they can, but it matters what kind of questions they're asking.
Hazm: The students nowadays... They are asking questions before even reading through their textbooks. Is it so hard to know the basics first?
Hazm: These little bastards keep bothering me. Even my good temper failed me.
Hazm: But ever since I started to do it my old classmate Tighnari's way, yelling "Don't move anything. Don't touch anything. If you don't already know all about something, then don't ask about it" to them several times.
Hazm: They kind of figured what was going on and stopped bothering me with stupid questions.
Hazm: It was brutal, but at least I taught them to think independently.
 See you.
Hazm: Okay.
