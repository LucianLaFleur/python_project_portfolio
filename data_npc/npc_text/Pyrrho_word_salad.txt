Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Step 4 in The Splendorous Sky That Day.


???: Who are you?
???: This is no place for you. Please, go back.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Step 6 in The Splendorous Sky That Day.


Pyrrho: Though Lady Sorush speaks for you, I will not be so lenient should you make any suspicious movements!
 Look who sounds all reliable.
Pyrrho: Hmph. Of course. I am one of the oldest qualified members of our Order, after all.
Pyrrho: I am not quite the equal of our Vijnanapati, but as one of the desertfolk who have lived here for generations, the Order and I are as one by blood.
Pyrrho: So if you encounter any issues, you can ask...
Pyrrho: No, wait! No. I won't be answering any of your questions!
 So, about your Vijnanapati...
Pyrrho: He's a very knowledgeable scholar! He knows more than anyone I've ever met.
Pyrrho: We Skeptics were once a Darshan within the Akademiya, but our traditions of knowledge have been eroded after hundreds of years here in the desert, far from the city.
Pyrrho: It's all thanks to our Vijnanapati that we are recovering our ancient traditions. With him around, our Order shall soon reclaim our lost glory!
 Don't worry, you shan't hear questions from me.
Pyrrho: Hmph. As it should be.

Dialogue Set #3[]
Available after completing As the Khvarena's Light Shows.


Pyrrho: Well, why are you back? Did you get the door slammed on you by our great Vijnanapati? I'll have you know that he doesn't compromise so easily with the Pari.
Pyrrho: You should just leave. And don't even think of getting anything more from me!
Paimon: Pfft! You spilled the beans without our help every time, though!
 So, about your Vijnanapati...
 Well, you say he's different, but...
You tell Pyrrho of the Great Songs and Nasejuna's betrayal.
Pyrrho: Nonsense. Utter nonsense! Our Vijnanapati is the most scholarly man I know. He would not band together with those defiled beings!
Pyrrho: I'll bet you're just trying to mask your failure by sowing dissent.
Pyrrho: Nice try, but your story's way out there. No way I'd fall for that!
Paimon: Ugh... C'mon, we gotta think. Don't we have those notes that Nasejuna gave us?
Paimon: It should still have Nasejuna's notes. Pyrrho should believe us if we give those to him!
Pyrrho: What notes are these? You really love those tricks of yours, don't you?
You give Rene's Investigation Notes to Pyrrho.
Pyrrho: This... This is indeed the great Vijnanapati's handwriting...
Pyrrho: It truly was a once-in-a-lifetime thing that we gained such a knowledgeable leader, and yet he turned his back on our duties and threw his lot with the followers of the dark hollow...
Pyrrho: *sigh* You may not know this, but we have struggled against the followers of the dark hollow for hundreds of years.
Pyrrho: You could say that they are akin to our shadow, always attempting to taint our heritage. I have no doubt that the fall of our order to its present state cannot be separated from their plots.
Pyrrho: But I never thought that this time, even our leader would be... Ah, a plague upon our house, this is!
Pyrrho: No doubt Nasejuna has gone with those impure villains and now skulks with them in the shadows.
Pyrrho: In the past, he followed Elder Aryadeva to the Akademiya, and upon returning, he was absorbed with those ancient documents.
Pyrrho: We were people who emphasized praxis, and we found ourselves without a scholar like him for many years. I had thought that he would lead us to reform, but...
 Honestly, we didn't see that one coming either.
 This wasn't your fault.
Pyrrho: But since this is how things have played out, I must handle that which remains to be done.
Pyrrho:  Our first priority is to appoint a new Vijnanapati. Things would go ill if someone takes advantage of this vacuum.
Paimon: Well, Paimon's really not sure if you have much of a vacuum worth sneaking into now...
Pyrrho: Indeed, and I am ashamed of it. As penance, allow me to give you these documents that Nasejuna left in my keeping. They record the various traditions of our Order.
Pyrrho: Although I have not been able to understand it, I believe it might be of interest to you, so please, take it.
Pyrrho: And if you should have any trouble in the future, just seek me out, and I will lend you my aid.
(Obtain  Ancient Volume)

Dialogue Set #4[]
Available after obtaining the  Ancient Volume from Pyrrho.


Pyrrho: To think that something like this would happen. What a disgrace...
Pyrrho: As I thought, stuff regarding knowledge doesn't really suit me all that much. Too complicated.
 Tell me about the Order of the Skeptics...
Pyrrho: Our top priority is choosing a new Vijnanapati, but as you can see, we do not have anyone who can currently fill that role.
Pyrrho: However, we have already asked Elder Aryadeva to invite an exceptional researcher to come over from the city.
Pyrrho: We have stood sentinel here these hundreds of years, and we have seen many a crisis through in our time. This is but a small problem. Don't worry about us!
 Not going over to the camp?
Pyrrho: All the more I should stand guard here at a time like this. If some ill-intentioned villains sneak in, things might really get bad.
Pyrrho: Even Miss Sosi told me not to go running around. She must rely on me quite a bit, I think.
 I'll leave you to it, then.
Pyrrho: Haha, see you, then.
