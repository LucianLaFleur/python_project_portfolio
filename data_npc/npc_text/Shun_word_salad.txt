Profile[]
Shun is a bandit who has been good friends with Hiromi and Yan'er since they were kids. He often goes treasure hunting with Yan'er. Hiromi eventually became a Shogunate soldier, much to both of their disgust, although Shun knew that Hiromi had options to choose from unlike him.
At some point while treasure hunting in Liyue, he and Yan'er were chased by the Guhua disciples Sun Yu and Little Que'er. While they were able to escape, he was separated from Yan'er, but was unable to check in on her and returned to Inazuma through unknown means.

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(If Hiromi's Watch is available but has not been started)
Shun: If you've got something to say, say it fast. Us Treasure Hoarders, our time's not yours for the wastin'.
 What are you doing here?
Shun: What else could it be? I'm one of the Treasure Hoarders, so I'm here for the treasure, of course!
 And why won't you go inside?
Shun: Are you trying to get me killed? It's dangerous inside!
 Well, if someone were to get to treasure first...
Shun: Hah! What I don't know about can't affect my bottom line.
Shun: That's a Treasure Hoarder-patented survival technique!
 Jeez...
Shun: Hehe~

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After being found during Hiromi's Watch)
Shun: If you've got something to say, say it fast. Us Treasure Hoarders, our time's not yours for the wastin'.
 So, about Hiromi...
Shun: Ah, he's a good lad... But he's a big baby, too. He needs a bit more time to grow.
Shun: So I say, but in the end, being immature is better than being evil.
Shun: He has his livelihood and his responsibilities...
Shun: It's not all his fault either that he's scared to make choices.
Shun: At least he's still got some choices to make.
