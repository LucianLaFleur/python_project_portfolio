Profile[]
Ramsay is a man originally from Snezhnaya, who is now residing in Komore Teahouse to sell foreign goods. He also writes travelogues for Midori when he can. Ramsay is often being followed and watched by Heihachi, as he believes that he is up to no good. Due to this, Ramsay feels unsafe going out by himself, which is why he asks the traveler to accompany him while looking for writing inspiration during International Travel Log.

Dialogue[]

(Before completing Transient Dreams)
Ramsay: Hello, are you an outlander who came to Inazuma too? Ah, we've become a real rare sight recently.
 Who are you?
Ramsay: I'm a merchant from Snezhnaya. I've been staying at Inazuma to get some rest.
Ramsay: The climate of Inazuma is warm and humid, and its cuisine is most exquisite. It's a far more forgiving place than Snezhnaya.
 How's business been?
Ramsay: It was quite good at first. Exotic items from faraway lands will sell well anywhere, after all.
Ramsay: But later on, the Resistance emerged in Sangonomiya due to the confiscation of Visions by the Shogunate. Business has gotten worse ever since that war started.
Ramsay: That just won't do. How can there be a healthy market in this environment? The way I see it, the Shogunate is stabbing itself in the foot... *sigh*
Ramsay: But though the current situation is grim, the weather in Inazuma remains very comfortable. And Komore Teahouse is very safe and secure. So all in all, I'm in no hurry to leave, haha.
 Do you often drink tea here?
Ramsay: Komore Teahouse is classy, has a fascinating view and is very cautious in choosing its guests. It is the best place for me to relax.
Ramsay: Walking around in the yard, watching the scenery and listening in to the chitchat of the guests are my favorite pastimes.
Ramsay: I have felt that I am being watched by somebody lately. It does creep me out...
Ramsay: But since I am already inside Komore Teahouse, I suppose I will be fine...
 How did you wind up here?
Ramsay: Hmm? Oh, you mean why am I not stuck in Ritou even though I'm an outlander?
Ramsay: Well... Komore Teahouse only serves useful individuals. That's all I can say.
 Goodbye.
Ramsay: Goodbye. Let's chat again next time.

Ramsay: But now that the Sakoku Decree has been abolished, I think things should pick up here again. I mean, life resurges wherever the blood flows, am I right?

 How did you get here, anyway?
Ramsay: Hmm? Oh, you mean why I didn't wind up stuck in Ritou even though I'm an outlander, even back during the days of the Sakoku Decree?
Ramsay: Well... Komore Teahouse only serves useful individuals. That's all I can say.
 Goodbye.
Ramsay: Goodbye. Let's chat again next time.
