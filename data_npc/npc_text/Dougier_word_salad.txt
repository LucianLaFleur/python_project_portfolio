Profile[]
Dougier is the founder of the Beret Society. His intention was to help everybody in the Fortress of Meropide turn over a new leaf and make their sentences less gloomy. With Wriothesley's help, Dougier was able to set up the organization, which helped Wriothesley with a lot of work he would otherwise have to handle himself.[1]
In truth, the society was formed in an attempt to overthrow Wriothesley's rule of the prison, as Dougier believed that he was hogging the prison's wealth and workforce to make his life comfortable and thus wanted to take it for himself. With the help of several unknown contacts, Dougier was able to get his hands on a strange black gem, custom thorns and a revolver. The gem was actually a container for a dark liquid known as "Aqua Doloris", a highly concentrated mix of "fear" and the thorns were meant to hold the liquid and inject it into a person's brain to put them in a state of perpetual fear, which was covered up by a hair clip.
Dougier would use this liquid to control the entire society, which promoted group punishment and ratting others out for violating them, since he knew that everyone in the prison was already guilty of a crime and thus another punishment would be nothing special. This punishment was known as a "censure" by its members. On the surface, he would pick the best members and open up a façade at the prison grounds, watching their every movement through a surveillance port when he was not present. He also managed to acquire a large number of Gardemeks through faux decommissioning orders and stealing them, which he intended to use as additional muscle to overthrow Wriothesley's rule. Wriothesley had attempted an investigation into the society, which Dougier had been aware of but believed that he was able to hide his intentions from him well and thus believed he was safe. After learning of his true intentions, they stormed his true headquarters, located underneath the Production Zone.
After Wriothesley destroyed the last Gardemek in his control, Dougier attempted to shoot him to no avail. When he placed a Cryo wall, Dougier then aimed at the Traveler and Paimon, prompting Wriothesley to rush and disarm him, grabbing him by his throat. In a pitiful attempt to save himself, he reminded him that unauthorized punishment and torture were not permitted, even though he had done the same to his own members. Wriothesley was unfazed by the reminder, slamming him into the ground and reminding him that he made the rules and could kill him if he wanted to, but he chose not to and had him placed back in confinement. Wriothesley later revealed to the Traveler that he intentionally did so to make him fear what punishments would come and when, intending to get "creative" and also have the former society members punish him for the fear he wrought into them. 

Appearance[]
Dougier, while maintaining his ordinary Fontainean clothing, is easily identified with his beret as the founder of the "Beret Society". His beret hat serves as the society's distinctive identity to make his fellow society members follow his orders. 

Personality[]
Dougier is seen to be a well-intentioned samaritan as the founder of the "Beret Society", at first. Behind his affable facade, he is a manipulative sociopath who abuses his position towards fellow members of his society, especially when Avice is forced into torturing her boyfriend Faissolle and Dougier himself silencing the latter when he is about to receive punishment. Without any members of the "Beret Society", his army of Gardemeks, and his signature beret, Dougier is nothing more than a mere coward who has yet to receive punishment, as Wriothesley points out.
