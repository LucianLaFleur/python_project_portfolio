Dialogue[]

Andou: Hold it there! Please cooperate with the security check.
 I don't mean any ill.
Andou: Ah, I didn't mean that you are a bad person. It's just a formality.
Andou: Please cooperate with us and display your ID.
 I can leave Paimon with you as collateral.
Andou: What... what is this?
Andou: Is it your companion? Then this P—Paimon being also needs an ID.
 I'm leaving~!
Andou: Eh!? Wait just a minute...
