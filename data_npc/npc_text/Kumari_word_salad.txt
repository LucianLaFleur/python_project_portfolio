Dialogue[]

Kumari: I would like to become a dancer as good as Nilou when I grow up!
 About dancing...
Kumari: Why won't Dad let me learn to dance...?
Kumari: He said dancing was looked down upon in Sumeru. To live a better life, I should go to school instead of learning how to dance.
Kumari: B—But, Nilou is so good at dancing, and everybody loves her so much...
Kumari: Is success at school more desirable than being a good dancer?
 About Nilou...
Kumari: I love Nilou! She's so gorgeous, and her voice is so melodious, and her dance is stunning...
Kumari: Every time I see Nilou, she would smile and let me touch the jewelry on her head.
Kumari: The Sabzeruz Festival is my favorite holiday. I can get candies from the Knight of Flowers, and I can watch Nilou's dance that day!
  I can't wait either.
Kumari: Then be sure not to miss it! Hope you'll have a chance to enjoy Nilou's dance and try the best sweets!
(Obtain  Sugar ×4)
 Good luck.
Kumari: I will!
