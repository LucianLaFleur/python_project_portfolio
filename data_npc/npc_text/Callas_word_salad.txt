Profile[]
Callas was the former president of Spina di Rosula. The construction of the aquabuses was sponsored by Spina di Rosula, so the Aquabus Callas line is named after him.
According to Melus and Silver, Callas was initially a respected man in Fontaine society, to the point where even Neuvillette and Clorinde spoke highly of him. He was bestowed the title of "Baron" by the Palais Mermonia, but refused it because he thought it was hollow. He had also met Wriothesley before his death.
However, after Callas was accused of murder, many turned their backs on him, calling him "Callas the Unfaithful."[1]

Appearance[]
He had blond hair and blue eyes, and his right eye was covered by an eyepatch.

Story[]
Callas was the first president of the Spina di Rosula, a group dedicated to helping others and finding the truth when the local authorities could not. He had a daughter, Navia, but his wife Clementine died from complications following her birth.
At some point prior to the events of the game, Callas decided to enter a partnership with the Court of Fontaine and Fontaine Research Institute regarding the aquabus system, which he believed would improve relationships with the rest of Fontaine and also pay well in the future. This led to a deep clash with another Spina member, Romeuf, who believed that the funds used for the aquabus construction would be better off improving Poisson. Callas disagreed with this, with Clementine supporting his decision. After she died, he decided to honor her request by going forth with the construction, which led to Romeuf leaving with a fair amount of other members on extremely bad terms, who likewise despised his entire family, including Navia, who they believed was no different than him.
Three years prior to the events of the game, Callas entered a partnership with Marcel, who sold the popular beverage known as Sinthe to the people of Poisson. However, Sinthe was actually water from the Primordial Sea diluted with regular water, which caused severe long-term side effects to those who drank it. Sinthe abuse eventually became a major problem, destroying many families in Fontaine. In response, Callas banned the drink and began to investigate its vendors, eventually convincing a seller named Jacques to work with him. Jacques' betrayal did not go unnoticed by his superiors, who ordered him to kill Callas. However, Jacques could not carry out the assassination, resulting in the mastermind hiring another person to commit the deed.
Callas later hosted a banquet by the countryside and went out to get air, with Jacques following suit. Everyone at the banquet suddenly heard two gunshots, and when they arrived to the scene, they found Callas with the gun and Jacques dead on the ground; Callas was then apprehended and charged with murder. This shocked his benefactors, most of whom withdrew support from him, and he began to be called "Callas the Unfaithful" by the people. In reality, Jacques had been killed by the third assassin that Marcel had hired, who was in turn shot and killed by Callas. The mastermind then dissolved the assassin with Primordial Water, thus erasing any evidence that could have exonerated Callas, as the public did not know that Fontainians could be dissolved in Primordial Water.
Rather than standing trial at the Opera Epiclese, Callas opted to maintain his innocence by facing the Champion Duelist Clorinde. Prior to the duel, he asked her to take care of his daughter for her, which she agreed to. Callas fought to the death in the ensuing duel and perished. These events confused Navia for many years, as Callas had kept his motives a secret from her, and caused her to have a strained relationship with Clorinde.
However, with the Traveler's assistance, Navia discovered the truth—rather than defending himself in court and likely testifying against the Sinthe producers, which would have caused them to retaliate against her, Callas had chosen to die in the duel against Clorinde. Thus, for years after the incident, Marcel did not attempt to harm Navia, as this would have triggered Callas' associates to share crucial intel about the Sinthe business with the authorities.[1]

I don't know why, but somehow, she's found herself at the epicenter of all sorts of bad news lately... Luckily for her, I've been snatching up all the articles that mention her and doing whatever damage control I can before they get published. Heh, and uh... then getting told off constantly by Euphrasie for interfering... But y'know, I think Navia deserves a break, so I'm happy to take one for the team. Also, she agreed to do an in-depth exclusive interview, which definitely sweetens the deal!FurinaAbout Navia: Inner Thoughts Media:VO_Furina About Navia - Inner Thoughts.ogg Media:VO ZH_Furina About Navia - Inner Thoughts.ogg Media:VO JA_Furina About Navia - Inner Thoughts.ogg Media:VO KO_Furina About Navia - Inner Thoughts.ogg She's a very strong person. Strong people will always manage to keep themselves together no matter what happens, acting like everything is fine. Doing so prevents other people around them from needlessly bearing additional pressure. I saw the duel between Callas and Clorinde... and I can say that in this respect, Navia is becoming more and more like her father.NaviaAbout Clorinde Media:VO_Navia About Clorinde.ogg Media:VO ZH_Navia About Clorinde.ogg Media:VO JA_Navia About Clorinde.ogg Media:VO KO_Navia About Clorinde.ogg She might not say much, or show a lot of emotion, but I can tell that she feels deeply. After my father's death, I... well, it caused quite a rift between us for a long time. But even then, I never did like having her constantly walking on eggshells around me... I much prefer how things are now.About Wriothesley Media:VO_Navia About Wriothesley.ogg Media:VO ZH_Navia About Wriothesley.ogg Media:VO JA_Navia About Wriothesley.ogg Media:VO KO_Navia About Wriothesley.ogg Trying to discuss anything with that guy is an exhausting process. Clorinde says I needn't have any reservations about collaborating with him in the scope of our preexisting agreement, but I still shouldn't trust everything that comes out of his mouth. No wonder my father never tried to get involved with the affairs of the Fortress... I think I'll play it safe and keep things that way.More About Navia: III Media:VO_Navia More About Navia - 03.ogg Media:VO ZH_Navia More About Navia - 03.ogg Media:VO JA_Navia More About Navia - 03.ogg Media:VO KO_Navia More About Navia - 03.ogg Sometimes, I like to go out into the wild, find a quiet place with no one else around, and do some target practice.It's a great way to destress! Wanna try? I can walk you through it step by step. You'd be my first student, but I feel like I'd be a great teacher.

Some veterans of the Spina think that I'm becoming more and more like him, but I think the trend they're referring to is a superficial one, born out of the simple fact that some problems only have so many solutions. Spina di Rosula has changed a lot since my father's day, and I intend to be the president for the Spina of today.NeuvilletteAbout Navia Media:VO_Neuvillette About Navia.ogg Media:VO ZH_Neuvillette About Navia.ogg Media:VO JA_Neuvillette About Navia.ogg Media:VO KO_Neuvillette About Navia.ogg I regret to say that after my various interactions with her — such as when I inadvertently angered her, and when I accepted her apology — and even now, in spite of the guilt I continue to feel over what happened to her father, I feel... very distant from her, as if I'm observing the starry sky from the bottom of a deep lake. It is by no means intentional, and I also know it is not something that I can easily make up for. Unlike water, emotion does not settle quickly once agitated, nor is it naturally inclined towards equilibrium.WriothesleyAbout Navia Media:VO_Wriothesley About Navia.ogg Media:VO ZH_Wriothesley About Navia.ogg Media:VO JA_Wriothesley About Navia.ogg Media:VO KO_Wriothesley About Navia.ogg The Fortress of Meropide works with Spina di Rosula on some matters regarding supplies and logistics, but we don't have any other dealings. This isn't because I don't trust Navia or her abilities, in fact, I hold her in quite high regard. The only reason we continue to stay out of each other's way is because I wanna honor the agreement I made with the late Mr. Callas.
Trivia[]
Callas' story is reminiscent of the story of Jean Calas, a French Protestant merchant falsely accused of strangling his son Marc-Antoine to death to allegedly prevent his conversion to Catholicism. Calas never confessed to the crime and was executed. Later, Voltaire wrote Treatise on Tolerance to denounce the religious intolerance displayed during the trial, which he alleged had caused Catholic society to turn against the Protestant Jean Calas. This publishing led to the reopening of the case and Calas' posthumous exoneration.
The spelling of Callas' is similar to Maria Callas, a 20th-century opera singer.
