 Now she's back...
Media:VO Granna 01.ogg "Now that Sedile is back, I can get her to help!"

Dialogue[]

Granna: Ah, Sedile's back in the village on vacation! I'll have to ask her how to pass the exam and join the Marechaussee Phantom!
 Huh, so there's an exam for that too...
Granna: Of course there is! Or do you think they let just anyone in?
Granna: It's precisely because they're so strict that passing is considered impressive. Hmph, I've gotta grab this chance to ask Sedile everything!
Granna: And once I've made it, I'm so gonna show off to Virda!
 May you be successful.
Granna: Heh, thanks, but no need! I'll be fine, with or without anyone's well-wishes!
