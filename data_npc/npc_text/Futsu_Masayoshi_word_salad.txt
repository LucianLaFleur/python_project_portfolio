Profile[]
Futsu Masayoshi was one of the greatest swordsmiths of the Futsu School, one of the five schools in the Raiden Gokaden. He was taken in by Futsu Minori, the third-generation master, and was the sworn brother of her son Futsu Hiroyoshi. After Minori's death, Masayoshi decided to leave the school to avoid a succession crisis and became a wanderer who learned the techniques of many different bladesmithing schools.[1]

Story[]
An orphan who was born mute and never learned to read or write, Masayoshi was taken in by Futsu Minori, and learned the art of swordsmithing from her. He was close with her because she had accepted him when nobody else had, while she often confided in him, joking that his muteness meant he couldn't spill any of her secrets.[1]
Before Minori's death, her blade Hasui Geppaku Futsu, which was wielded by the Raiden Shogun's valet (possibly Chiyo), was broken in a certain fight to "decide the fate of the oni people." It was sent to be reforged, but because Minori was no longer capable of swordsmithing, Masayoshi took up the task in her stead and forged Haran Geppaku Futsu.[1]
Because Masayoshi was a superior weaponsmith compared to Futsu Hiroyoshi, a succession crisis nearly occurred after Minori's death as a result of Masayoshi's fame following his forging of Haran. To resolve the issue, Masayoshi taught Hiroyoshi Minori's techniques and, after determining that Hiroyoshi could stand independently, left the Futsu School. He traveled around Inazuma and abroad to further his mastery of the craft. Eventually, he went on to mentor three students of the Isshin Art, another school in the Raiden Gokaden, whom he viewed as his best disciples: Kaedehara Kagemitsu, Niwa Nagamitsu, and Akame Mitsunaga.[1]
