Profile[]
Agnes left her home (Earnshaw's cottage) several years ago[1] and ended up in the Fortress of Meropide. 
Agnes worked with Lutz to send letters to Earnshaw. While at Meropide, Agnes was pregnant and gave birth to a daughter Lanoire. Agnes cherished Lanoire as the precious thing in her life, comparing her to "a little flower sprouting out of a crack in the rock, determined to grow even in the absence of sunlight or rain."[2]
As Lanoire did not have a proof of identity, Agnes had to start the process of sending Lanoire out of the Fortress. She said that she never received a reply to her letters from other family members.[3]
Agnes was plagued by a chronic illness and passed away in Meropide some time ago (which Earnshaw was unaware of). As a result, Lanoire became an orphan, and Estienne asked Cater to look after her. During the events of Unfinished Comedy, the Traveler and Estienne work together with Cater and Lanoire to help them escape to the surface and return Lanoire to her grandfather Earnshaw.[3]
Agnes loved Earnshaw's Tasses Ragout, saying it was better than the food made in the Fortress.[2] She was also the one who named the poodles Hero, Prince, and Princess. In fact it was due to her urging that Earnshaw agreed to get and raise these pets,[1] and she enjoyed dressing them up.[4] Earnshaw eventually did find out that Agnes passed away. Agnes was known to have a cheery disposition, smiling to everyone even to the end.[5]
