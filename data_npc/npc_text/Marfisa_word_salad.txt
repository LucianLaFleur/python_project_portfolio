Marfisa was once a legendary Champion Duelist. Her origins are currently unknown. She held her own unique perspective on righteousness and justice and was exceptionally dedicated to her beliefs, stating that "Crimes must be publicly punished, and lies must be publicly exposed. That is how the world ought to operate, and how righteousness should be."[3]
Parsifal or Josephine may be important to Marfisa, as they both originate from the same location.[1][3]
In her youth, she fought with a swordsman from the Marechaussee Phantom, Emanuel Guillotin. Marfisa was defeated by Emmanuel's cunning tactics, forcing her to acknowledge the inferiority of her spearsmanship. As such, Marfisa began treating Emanuel as her fated opponent.[3]
During the Siege of Poisson, Parsifal the Great (or possibly her younger sister Josephine using the alias) was captured. Parsifal, who had a past connection to Marfisa, requested trial by combat before the court. She presumably died in the duel against Marfisa. 
Marfisa once thought to seek out Emanuel once again, and give it her all in a final duel. However, she learned that he had long retired after the Siege of Poisson; he now hid his wounded face with a mask, had lost the frivolous, provocative voice he once possessed, and had become an alcoholic. Marfisa believed Emanuel had betrayed his past life, but she resolved to personally discover the truth and hunt down Emanuel.[3]
She eventually found the mask left behind by the dissolved Emanuel, and her quest for revenge seemed to be rewarded. However, she was unexpectedly met by the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, the organization Emanuel had been investigating. In the end, she was dissolved by the leader of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, known as the Narzissenkreuz, who absorbed Marfisa's consciousness and acquired her mastery of "spear technique".[3][4]

Etymology[]
