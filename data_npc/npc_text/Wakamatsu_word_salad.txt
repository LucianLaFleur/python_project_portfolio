Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Shrouded Vale, Hidden Hero.


Wakamatsu: It seems this is as far as I go...
 Are you alright?
Wakamatsu: I... I... I crossed the seas, evading the intercepting Shogunate Dogs, crossed light-years and seas of stars... only to be defeated by this mountain...
 You sure you're not exaggerating...
Wakamatsu: Master Zhenyu, I did not realize that the road to the shrine of martial skill was to be so arduous...
 Good luck. See ya.
Wakamatsu: How... mortifying...

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Shrouded Vale, Hidden Hero.


Wakamatsu: Please, Master! Take me in as your disciple!
Wen the Fourth: As long as you ensure that you will practice more...
Wakamatsu: Rest assured, I will!
Wakamatsu: Holding buckets with my arms outstretched, holding a low stance under a waterfall... I'll do them all!
Wen the Fourth: Young man, such martial arts training methods don't exist.
Wakamatsu: Haha. Once I learn this stuff, it's time to show them what for, eh?
Wen the Fourth: *sigh* Young man, are you listening to me?
Wen the Fourth: You need to start from the fundamentals, like that non-initiated disciple at the practice all. Start with the wooden stakes as your foe...
