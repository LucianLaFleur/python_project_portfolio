Dialogue[]

Fein: Traveler, would you like to try Heart of the Dice?
 Yep.
Fein: No problem. Um, have you finished reading the rulebook yet?
Fein: Oh, it's fine, you don't have to read it cover to cover to play. You can always learn as you play.
(Opens Heart of the Dice interface)
 I've got something else to do.
Fein: You're busy? Alright then, feel free to come find me anytime. This booth will be here throughout the King of Invokations Grand Prix event period.
