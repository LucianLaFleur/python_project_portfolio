Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Iaune: What *is* the meaning of work, really...
 Hello there.
Iaune: Hello! I'll get the materials needed today right away— Oh, it's you!
Iaune: We meet again, Traveler. It's my pleasure.
Iaune: And no, that's not mere formality. Seeing you is like seeing a gear turning on an intricate axis within a clock — it's as if my life is still on the right track.
 Still feeling the pressure?
Iaune: Well... yeah.
Iaune: I'm not ashamed to admit that. It just means that I'm "taking every problem too seriously"!
Iaune: That's what Roialte and Semaine always tell me, anyway.
Iaune: But I still don't believe that being serious is a bad thing. That's why I've expanded the document workload here by three times, I suppose.
Iaune: But don't worry too much about me. I'll do my best to finish my work. You go about your day too, alright?
 Don't think too hard about stuff, alright?
Iaune: ...You're right. I have to put my past frustrations behind me and just take the useful experience on.

Nighttime[]

Iaune: Time to plan a camping trip... Fishing, or mountain climbing? Should I ask Estelle to come along?
 Planning a vacation, are we?
Iaune: That might be a bit of an overstatement. I'm just considering what to do on an off day.
Iaune: I'm currently trying to avoid thinking about work when not at work... Emphasis on "trying."
 That's a pretty good idea, actually.
Iaune: Yes. But walking the walk isn't as easy as talking the talk...
Iaune: Thank you so much for your help. Please accept these humble gifts that I caught myself.
(Obtain  Fish ×4)
 Have fun.
Iaune: Thank you!
