Profile[]
A young Oceanid from Fontaine, who greatly admired and left to find Rhodeia of Loch. She joins the Traveler and Paimon in resolving the issue of the water near Dawn Winery turning bitter.  She is first met after the Traveler defeats some oddly-behaving Hydro Slimes. Suffering from the bitter water, she is brought to Springvale to recuperate in the sweet waters of the spring. While there, she passes messages between Old Finch and Callirhoe. Though initially speaking in a halting and childlike manner and possessing very limited understanding, her speech and understanding rapidly evolve as she merges with each Hydro Mimic. Endora successfully communicates with Rhodeia, resolving a misunderstanding and quelling her ire, with Rhodeia then ceasing to make the waters bitter. Though initially planning to merge with Rhodeia, Endora ultimately decides to accompany the Traveler and Paimon in their travels.

Etymology[]
Her name is quite similar to the name of an Oceanid from Greek mythology, Eudora.
Endora may be derived from the city Endor (Hebrew: עֵין־דֹּאר) (derived from Hebrew עַיִן ayin, "spring, fountain" + דּוֹר dor, "dwelling") which can mean "fountain of dwelling."[1]
Incidentally, the Lochfolk hail from the nation of Fontaine, which means "fountain" in French.
In Chinese, her name is transcribed as 嫣朵拉 Yānduǒlā, where the character 嫣 yān literally means "beautiful."
Coincidentally, the character 嫣 can be read as en in Japanese, which more closely matches her English name.
In Japanese, her name is transcribed as エンドラー Endoraa.
