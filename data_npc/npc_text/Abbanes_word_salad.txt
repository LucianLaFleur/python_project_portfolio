Dialogue[]

Abbanes: Something's not quite right recently... Looks like we need to get a couple more mercenaries.
 Is something up?
Abbanes: Nothing serious, but something's not right either way.
Abbanes: We have a ship in our caravan, right? I recently found out that Snezhnayan imports to the Akademiya have increased by quite a lot.
Abbanes: Many caravans were surprised by this turn of events, and many agreed upon plans were disrupted.
Abbanes: Also, I feel that the pirates have been making bigger moves these days. There have also been sightings of Kairagi in the open sea!
Abbanes: I don't want to run into any pirate attacks. We've got to think of something.
 See you.
Abbanes: Bye. I'll have to think about hiring someone.
