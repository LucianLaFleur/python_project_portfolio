 Just like hunting down prey...

Guest Challenge[]

Gary: I will surely defeat all my opponents just like how I chase down prey, and I'll become the best Genius Invokation TCG player in no time... Hmm? Can I help you?
 Let's play a round of Genius Invokation TCG!
(Open Genius Invokation TCG challenge interface)
 No, it's nothing...
Gary: Well, if you're ever looking for someone to play Genius Invokation TCG with, you can come to me.
(If the player loses the match)
Gary: Hmm... With this, you have also become my caught "prey."
(If the player wins the match)
Gary: I can't believe you got away with it! You won't be so lucky next time...
