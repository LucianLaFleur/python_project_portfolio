Luther[1] was the writer of the Ancient Investigation Journals, and little is known about him aside from him apparently growing up with Ingbert, Parsifal and Eberhart.[2] However, since he calls Landrich, Parsifal, Ingbert and Eberhart 'Master' it seems he's likely from a lesser noble family or was a commoner or slave that was hired by Landrich. Another point that makes this likely is his mention of most likely having to become a gladiator if he fails this assignment.[3]
He also apparently knows Priscilla, but is unaware that she's in on Eberhart's plan, similarly to how he was unaware of Eberhart's plan until he attacked Ingbert.
Throughout the expedition he's uncertain of some choices being made, but doesn't question any of the nobles' motives, expecting them to be loyal. He's eventually attacked by Eberhart at the same time Ingbert was, but survives long enough to get away and finish the third and final journal before dying to his fatal injury.[2]
