Dialogue[]

Xiangming: What is it? I'm on Millelith duty right now. Please keep your voice down...
Xiangming: Also, please don't make any "shh" noises.
 What are you doing?
Xiangming: SHH! Keep your voice DOWN! If he hears us, he'll notice me!
Xiangming: ...Ugh, now you've made me raise my voice too! Thanks a bunch...
Xiangming: Look, I serve in the Millelith, and my job is to guard this bank. I've been watching that guy for a long time now — the one pacing around by the entrance.
Xiangming: Funny thing is, he never withdraws any money. Never deposits any, either. He just hangs around there all day long, every time he comes here. I need to figure out what he's up to...
Xiangming: That's why I've got to watch him like a hawk. In case he leaves a sign for the Treasure Hoarders, or something. It's just...
 It's just what?
Xiangming: Why does he have to stand there all day long!
Xiangming: I can hold out, but what I can't do is hold it in... I'm desperate for the toilet!
Xiangming: Why, oh why won't he just go away...
Xiangming: Ah... I'm reaching the point of no return...
 See you.
Xiangming: Bye.
Xiangming: ...I can't go AWOL from the Millelith just to relieve myself... I might find myself relieved of my duties by the time I get back...

Trivia[]
