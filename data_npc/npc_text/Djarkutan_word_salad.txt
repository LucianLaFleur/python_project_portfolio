 The soil composition...
Media:VO Djarkutan 01.ogg "I need an effective way of separating the soil into its discrete components."

Dialogue[]

Djarkutan: We can rule out temperature and moisture, so it must be a problem with the soil...
 And you are...?
Djarkutan: I'm Djarkutan, a researcher from Amurta. I'm here to conduct research on tea trees.
 You certainly have a broad range of topics.
Djarkutan: *sigh* It's not like I had any other choice! The more unusual a subject is, the easier it is to write a paper on it.
Djarkutan: Tea tree transplantation, for example. Practically no one in the Akademiya is paying attention to it, so I have no rivals on the subject.
Djarkutan: It's just that...
 What's wrong?
Djarkutan: For some reason... The tea trees we bring over to Sumeru never survive.
Djarkutan: After much thought, I feel that the reason must be the soil. Unfortunately, I never understood my geology and hydrology classes, and starting from scratch now is... difficult...
 Goodbye.
Djarkutan: Goodbye.
