  Mentioned Characters 




Ukko is a character mentioned in Princess' Box, who lived thousands of years ago during the final days of the Sal Vindagnyr civilization.
While Ukko's significance has never been specified, the Princess' Box description and a lack of other unnamed contemporary significant figures suggests that he was also the scribe of Sal Vindagnyr, a figure who provides the quotations in the Scribe's Box and the Ancient Carvings.

Story[]
Ukko appears to have been close to the Princess during their lifetimes, given that she apologizes to him in her thoughts for having to "see us like this."[1] In turn, Ukko appears to have been somewhat protective over the Princess, condemning Imunlaukr as "that outsider who abandoned the princess,"[2] unaware that the outlander had never given up on his search for a way to end the disaster brought about by the Skyfrost Nail.[3]
He was the last survivor of Sal Vindagnyr's fall and recorded their downfall in the Ancient Carvings. Based on this, he was also the one who found and buried the Princess after she died trying to graft an Irminsul Tree branch onto a healthy tree.[4] His bitterness over their fate is recorded in the Scribe's Box description where, among his other hopes for the world's destruction, he alluded to Khaenri'ah as "a new nation without gods" which he hoped would "have the power to stand against this world."

Legacy[]
A respawning Frostarm Lawachurl on Dragonspine can be fought with a boss HP bar and the name "Ukko."[Note 1]

The Lawachurl named Ukko.
Notes[]

↑ While there is no explicit connection between the scribe Ukko and the Lawachurl Ukko, their shared uncommon name and presence on Dragonspine, combined with Ukko's vocal hatred of the world and the gods at Sal Vindagnyr's end, makes it likely that he was afflicted with the curse which transforms people into hilichurls as punishment for forsaking their god. This curse and its nature is attested to in Perinheri, and was laid on all non-pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns during the cataclysm.

↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 French, Thai, Vietnamese, German, Indonesian, and Portuguese: The name "Ukko" is not mentioned in these localizations of the Princess' Box description. These names were taken from the name of the Frostarm Lawachurl since the name mentioned in Princess' Box is identical to the name of the Frostarm Lawachurl across all localizations where both are localized.
