Story[]
Araji, Aramaha, and Arayama's friendship was comparable to the friendship of the three God-Kings: King Deshret, the Goddess of Flowers, and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.[1]
Aramaha had a great love of flowers. They knew how to take care of plant and make them healthy and strong.[2] Their rhythm is "Rhythm of the Sprout," which is able to generate healthier Dendrogranum, which can then be used to revive Valaya.[3]
Presumably during the cataclysm, Aramaha fought again the Marana. Afterward, they turned into a Vasara Tree inside a sealed Ashvattha's Concourse, and left their song behind as a method to unseal it.[4]
