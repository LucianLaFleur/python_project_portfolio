Sun Yu's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Sun Yu grew up with Little Que'er and have studied the Guhua Clan's martial arts together. Sun Yu is devoted to the clan and seeks to revive the dying art. He views Que'er as a sister to him, oblivious to her romantic feelings towards him and baffled by her extremely aggressive reactions to those who interact with him.
After realizing that staying at Mt. Aocang would not help revive the Guhua Clan, Sun Yu decides to leave Liyue to travel abroad after running into a Fontanian merchant who told him that he couldn't "find the solution to the problem at its occurrence." After some training with the Traveler, he ultimately prepares to leave, asking them to bring a box of soil as a reminder of his homeland before ultimately leaving for Fontaine with the merchant and the adventurer who brought him to the Chasm for training.

Dialogue[]

Sun Yu: Huh? What is it?
 Who are you?
Sun Yu: My liege, I am Sun Yu, disciple of the Guhua Clan; I have journeyed here to harness my inner energies... Well, to practice.
Sun Yu: Did you want something? If not, please do not disturb me.
 What's the Guhua Clan?
Sun Yu: Have you not heard of the renowned ancient arts of the Guhua Clan?
Sun Yu: *sigh* ...Oh well.
Sun Yu: In its glory days, the Guhua Brotherhood roamed the lands freely and none dared to challenge them.
Sun Yu: Their reputation for dual mastery of the polearm and the sword was such that all the martial nomads in Teyvat had heard of it, and none doubted it veracity.
Sun Yu: Sadly, no party is everlasting... Centuries have passed, and while many Guhua relics remain, the great practitioners are long gone.
Sun Yu: After a slew of desertions, the Guhua Brotherhood regrouped as the much smaller Guhua Sect, with barely a few hundred disciples. Today's Guhua Clan is now all that is left of this grand tradition, with a mere handful of practitioners...
Sun Yu: *sigh* ...
 Are you two all that's left of the Guhua Clan?
Sun Yu: Our numbers are reduced, yes, but not to that extent... It's just that the various disciples of our Clan have been scattered every corner of Liyue.
Sun Yu: Traveler, have you heard of one known as Xingqiu?
Sun Yu: He is a junior of mine, but he was the first among us to grasp the concept of the Martial Principle.
Sun Yu: He once wrote a mantra and utterly changed the legacy of the Guhua Clan.
Sun Yu: I don't know what became of him. Perhaps he's still roaming the land, doing good wherever he goes. Hahaha...
 Harnessing your inner energies?
Sun Yu: ...I guess there's no point hiding it from you if you're an outlander.
Sun Yu: The true purpose behind my journeying here is to seek divine guidance on the Way, to find a means of reviving the Guhua Clan.
 You two seem to get on really well.
Sun Yu: I've always treated her like a sister...
Sun Yu: We've always been inseparable when practicing martial arts, like a form to its shadow. I consider us equally matched, both in combat and in courage.
Sun Yu: Hence, I brought her here with me, that we might search for divine guidance and bring about the Guhua renaissance together.
Sun Yu: She has an odd temperament, normally being prone to chatter... Yet with me, she is like a completely different person. I find this a bit of a headache to comprehend.
 Goodbye.
Sun Yu: Fare thee well.
