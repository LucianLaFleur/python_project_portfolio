Media:VO Charmian All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Charmian: (Still, I can't be too harsh. What if he refuses to even talk to me about this next time?)

Dialogue[]

Charmian: Forgive my honesty, Intef, but we reached this point in our debate because you had to mention the Goat King.
Intef: Of course, of course. And I agree with your assessment of him as a treacherous official. None would deny his role in King Deshret's rulership had two sides.
Intef: Good and evil — he was both. That is the reality of it, is it not? His ambition came from his power and wisdom.
Charmian: Indeed, and compared to Lord Hermanubis, all impure souls should know themselves filthy and shamed. But that matters not. I merely contend that the Goat King is nothing before the Crocodile King.
Intef: The Crocodile King, superior? Al-Ahmar above, grant this person eyes to see the many texts we have collected here!
Charmian: And what of them? Do any of them say that they were of equal worth?
Intef: None say that they were not.
Charmian: *sigh* Come on, you've got to listen to me...
