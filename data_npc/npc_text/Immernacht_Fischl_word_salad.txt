Profile[]
Immernacht Fischl is encountered in Immernachtreich Apokalypse (Part 3) during the event Summertime Odyssey. As the mirage's manifestation of Fischl's flaws and insecurities about herself, she forces Fischl to confront her shortcomings and weakens Fischl's confidence in herself, to the point were Fischl initially gives up, accepting the mirage as her tomb, but after the kind words of her allies, she is able to continue. Immernacht Fischl also demands that Oz join her, and he accepts, leaving the playable Fischl unable to summon Oz by her side.
After Fischl and the rest of the party make it through the monster-infested library, Fischl confronts Immernacht Fischl and accepts her flaws as part of who she is, to Oz's delight. With her confidence in herself restored, Fischl then absorbs Immernacht Fischl back into her heart.

Appearance[]
Immernacht Fischl dons a seemingly new dress contrasting with Fischl's main dress, with a ruffled top and what seems to be some sort of purple corset, with 2 rhombus shaped symbols stacking ontop of eachother. Along with this, she wears a pair of black shorts with some sort of triangular accessory, with a grayish-silver frame and a dark purple inside. Her leggings contrast in sizes, with one being visibly shorter and one reaching the top of her leg. A pair of dark purple heels is also seen, with a lighter and more vibrant purple bow with the same rhombus/star like symbol in the middle. She has a pair of 2 sleeves, with another rhombus or diamond shaped, narrow slit revealing a white sleeve underneath, which eventually leads to 2 ruffled cuffs that are the 'end' of the sleeve. Along with this, she wears a goldish-brown outlined piece ontop of a small bow, and a laced black neck-piece, along with a white necklace with a purple-blue like oval gem, and what seems to be a silver heart like piece placed under the laced neck piece.
