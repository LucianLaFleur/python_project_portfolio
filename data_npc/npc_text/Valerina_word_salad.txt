Dialogue[]
Available after completing Furball Fortress's Frightful Fix!


Valerina: Honorary Knight, Cat Whisperer Paimon, are you two tired? Would you like something to eat or drink? Or perhaps a massage to relax your muscles?
 Never mind that for now. Let's talk business...
Paimon: That's right! It can't have been cheap setting up this Furball Fortress. Even Paimon knows that...
Paimon: If there's a problem with the finances, don't hesitate to let us know and we'll figure something out!
Valerina: Ah, so that's what you were concerned about... Well, we've nothing to worry about as far as Mora is concerned.
Valerina: My parents are both merchants. Not super rich, but they do support me with "operational funds" each month, so running the Fortress is no big deal at all.
Valerina: I might look like a stiff breeze could blow me away, but I was the "riddle solver" in my adventuring team back when I was with the Adventurers' Guild.
Valerina: Quite often my entire team relied on my intelligence to overcome the strange mechanisms in the ruins and get us to the treasure.
Valerina: That's to say, I didn't come cheap if anyone wanted to hire me as a freelance adventurer. I used to take on quite a bit of work, too. Sometimes I'd even complete over ten missions in a month.
Valerina: In fact, the Mora I earned on my own has surpassed the "operational funds" my parents provide me with. At this point, I have enough to handle my daily expenses for a lifetime and then some.
Valerina: I don't really have any hobbies, and now the money that was just sitting in my savings is being used to help cats today, and tomorrow, it might help more animals still. That works out just as it should, don't you think?
Paimon: Wow, you're... certainly wealthy beyond Paimon's expectations... Hang on, what do you mean "That works out just as it should"?
Valerina: Hmm. How should I put this... I've been part of many adventuring teams in my time, and I've dealt with all sorts of animal-loving people and pets.
Valerina: I've also met some compassionate souls asking others... and even the Knights of Favonius or the Church to adopt stray animals.
Valerina: This, while they themselves don't have any money beyond that needed to support themselves.
Valerina: Some good souls with the means, on the other hand, donate enough Mora to take care of one or two stray cats. They're good role models.
Valerina: I mean, it's good to have sympathy, but I don't really like asking others to do things that they... well, aren't even responsible for in the first place, you know, just because of your own feelings.
Valerina: That's why solving this problem is a job for someone who's both willing and rich, like me — I'll pay, and I'll do my part!
Valerina: Of course, I'll stop bothering you two and Ms. Rosaria once I've learned how to get along with cats!
Paimon: Huh. Y'know what, Valerina? That's kinda cool! Paimon didn't know that you had this side to you.
Paimon: Those stray cats are real lucky to have met someone like you. Paimon sure hopes that the Furball Fortress will help more cats in the future!
 Well done indeed!
 A commendable spirit!
Valerina: Hahaha, such wonderful praise from the Honorary Knight and Cat Whisperer Paimon...! Ah, now I'm getting really pumped up again!
Valerina: I'll keep working at it. I will learn how to communicate with cats and manage the Fortress as best I can!
 Food and drinks?
Paimon: Huh, did you set up a kitchen in here, Valerina? Paimon hasn't seen one.
Paimon: And what about the chef? Or are you gonna step up to the plate?
Valerina: As you can see, while this place isn't officially open yet, some guests still stay here for long periods of time.
Valerina: And I wouldn't say making them go out and buy food and drinks themselves is an ideal situation.
Valerina: As such, I've set things up with Sara at Good Hunter so that if our guests have requests for takeout, they can leave them with me. Then, Ms. Rosaria or I will put the order in at Good Hunter.
Valerina: I'm not running this place to make a profit, so the prices for ordering takeout will be the same as getting it straight from the restaurant.
Paimon: W—Wait, you're not even charging them for the delivery fee?
Paimon: I'm sure our guests will be thrilled to be able enjoy delicious food at the original price while playing with cats!
Valerina: Right? Even you think it's a great idea, don't ya, Cat Whisperer?
Valerina: Once the Fortress officially opens, this can be one of its selling points!
Valerina: The more people we attract, the more likely the cats are to find a suitable owner. Once the number of visitors and the rate at which I adopt cats reaches a nice balance, I'll consider expanding the scale of our operations.
Valerina: Once that happens, we'll be able to add a management area, and areas in which other stray animals can be adopted...
Valerina: Though that's an issue I'll have to plan out in the future. Just leave the business operations and data gathering to me. Don't sweat that stuff!
 No worries, we know you're busy!
Valerina: Hah, not as busy as you, I expect! Why, I should watch the two of you work more if anything!
