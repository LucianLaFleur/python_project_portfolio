Ingbert was a Mondstadt aristocrat who lived during the time of the Aristocratic period one thousand years ago. Little is known about him other than that he was apparently a legitimate heir of Landrich, which would make him the brother of Parsifal and the illegitimate heir Eberhart, who killed him to move ahead in the line of succession once he knew he would be granted legitimacy.[1]
Ingbert loved the idea of exploration and adventure, and the entire expedition to Dragonspine was likely orchestrated by Eberhart for the sole purpose of killing Ingbert. Ingbert may have been the one that Eberhart referred to in the Ragged Records as 'the chosen' who had elemental energy burning in his blood.

Story[]
Ingbert grew up with Luther and his brothers Parsifal and Eberhart.
Ingbert was part of an expedition to Dragonspine organized by Landrich to quell the desire of those who hope to rebel against the aristocracy. Besides him, the expedition also included Eberhart, Luther, Nick and some other unnamed members.
Sometime after arriving at the mountain, the team was caught in a snowstorm and the unnamed members were separated from the others, who met up at the South Base Camp. Eberhart convinced the others that the unnamed members would find their way back to camp and they themselves should investigate a secret room. They couldn't open the door to the secret room and a cave-in killed Nick, burying his supplies with him. The remaining three decided to return to their base camp.[2]
At the camp, they did not find the unnamed members as expected but still decided to stay there until the storm died down. The next day they pursued their original plan of investigating a cellar. Once they arrived, Ingbert was attacked by Eberhart who was trying to kill him and Luther. Both were injured, and Ingbert counterattacked with his Vision, heavily wounding Eberhart who was forced to retreat. Ingbert managed to catch up to him but was then killed by Eberhart. Eberhart presumably killed him to move ahead in the line of succession.[1]
