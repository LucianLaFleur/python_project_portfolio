Toratarou (Japanese: 寅太郎 Toratarou) is a Shiba that is found locked in a cage on Jinren Island. It is possible to free Toratarou by completing the Hidden Exploration Objective Free the Dog which grants players the Wonders of the World achievement Who Let the Dogs Out.
According to dialogue in The Farmer's Treasure, Toratarou is owned by the Kairagi and Nobushi group of Jinren Island. However, when Saimon Jirou is threatened to have the dogs unleashed on him, he wonders if they are talking about other dogs apart from Toratarou, as he claims that Toratarou is a very friendly dog that wouldn't bite anyone.
