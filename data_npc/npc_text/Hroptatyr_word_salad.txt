Story[]
Hroptatyr, also called "The Wise", is known as one of the Five Sinners of Khaenri'ah. They were one of the people in the nation of Khaenri'ah who were of great esteem. They were the best of their respective fields, and this and the moniker suggest that Hroptatyr excelled at something related to "wisdom".
