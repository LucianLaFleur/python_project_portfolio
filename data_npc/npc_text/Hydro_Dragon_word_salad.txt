Story[]
The original Hydro Dragon was one of the Seven Sovereigns, dragon-lords who ruled over the seven nations of the old world.[1] According to Hydro Vishap legend, the Hydro Dragon was the "beating heart" that ruled over the Primordial Sea.[2] Alongside the other sovereigns, it went to war against the Heavenly Principles and was eventually defeated.[1] Sometime following its defeat, the original Hydro Dragon withered away.[3] The Heavenly Principles took a portion of each of the dragon sovereigns' power and bestowed it upon the archons.[4]
According to Cassiodor, the Hydro Dragon couldn't be reborn while his divine counterpart Egeria remained in hibernation in the deep sea.[5]
A prophecy in Enkanomiya claimed that a new Hydro Dragon will be born in human form as these dragon-lords require a "pure" vessel, and the Bathysmal Vishaps, originally Hydro, had become "impure" when they evolved to harness the powers of Electro and Cryo.[6][7][8] This prophecy eventually came true, as the Hydro Dragon incarnated in the form of Neuvillette, the Iudex of Fontaine.
According to Freminet, there is a legend that a Hydro Dragon once resided in Fontaine, and it is said that every time it weeps, the skies will cloud up and pour out rain; if one would wish for the rain to stop, they should shout "Hydro Dragon, Hydro Dragon, don't cry!" to the sky[9] This legend is true, as the skies have been shown to rain whenever Neuvillette experiences great grief. Focalors herself during her conversation with Neuvillette also told him "Hydro Dragon, Hydro Dragon, don't cry."[10]
Before the events of Archon Quest The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur in Chapter IV: Act V - Masquerade of the Guilty took place, none of the dragon sovereigns possessed the level of power they once had, including Neuvillette. As Neuvillette himself was reborn in a human form, he lost a large amount of his memories, such as being unable to remember his connection to the Primordial Sea. While he is able to push back the Primordial Sea's waters, he had less control over them than the original Hydro Dragon did. To restore his full dragonhood, Neuvillette would need the Archon to return their elemental Authority to him; however, he believed this solution to be unworkable, as it would require the death of the Hydro Archon.[4] Unbeknownst to him, Focalors had put a plan into a motion to do just that, and she would later meet with Neuvillette and execute herself to return the Hydro Archon's authority to him. With that, Neuvillette regained his predecessor's full power, using it to make the Fontainians fully human and prevent the prophecy from dissolving them.[10]
Upon Furina's abdication from the post of Hydro Archon, the affairs related with the title has been passed on to Neuvillette, with the duties of the Hydro Sovereign and the Iudex now coexisting within his person.[11] Neuvillette has also decided to continue giving out Visions, in recognition of human will.[12]
