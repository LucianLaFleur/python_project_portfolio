Profile[]
Uncle He is a member of the Chasm Exploration Team that went deeper into the Chasm to look for Qi Nan's toy.  Since he has been lost inside the Chasm for years, people thought that he had died and even held a funeral for him, which Jinwu refused to attend. Living for years in the Chasm, he ate the mushrooms in the area to avoid starvation which gave him itchy ears and an addiction to eating mushrooms.[2]
