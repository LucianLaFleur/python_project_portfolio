Mikoshi Chiyo (Japanese: 御輿千代 Mikoshi Chiyo), also known as Torachiyo (Japanese: 虎千代 Torachiyo), was an oni[1] and a member of the Mikoshi Clan who lived around five hundred years ago. She was the biological mother of Iwakura Michihiro[2] and the adoptive mother of Mikoshi Nagamasa.[3] She was a close ally of the Raiden Shogun, Ei.
Chiyo is depicted alongside the Raiden Shogun, Sasayuri, and the Kitsune Saiguu in Raiden Shogun: Nightmare. She is the second to disappear from the picnic ground after Ei recollects their battle against each other.

Profile[]
Chiyo was once a valuable ally of the Raiden Shogun Ei and campaigned with her against the dark forces that emerged during the cataclysm. However, she was swallowed whole by a "beast of sin" and while inside its stomach, was tainted by the darkness. Even though she managed to rip the beast apart and slay it, she was forever changed: she would later turn her blade on Ei, after which she was defeated and badly injured. Her ultimate fate is unknown.[1]

Appearance[]
She allegedly looked "as lovely as the moon," and was so beautiful that the Kitsune Saiguu wanted to hide her own face behind a mask.[4] She is also described as "petite" and "dainty".[5]
In Raiden Shogun: Nightmare, she is depicted with two large horns on her head, red iris, golden pupil, and long grayish purple hair with red highlights. She is wearing her battle-garb: a white juunihitoe with red and pink trim and a gold interior. When Ei recollected their battle, Chiyo is shown with glowing red eyes and two glowing red scratches on the left side of her face.

Story[]
Chiyo was a close ally of Ei and fought against the dark forces of the cataclysm. During one particular battle, she was swallowed whole by a beast with a tiger's body and a snake's tail. While within this "beast of sin," she was "stained by a deep sin" and witnessed her comrades being torn apart by the beast's jaws.
She drew her sword against the Shogun, but her sword-arm and horn were severed. She then fled and disappeared into the forest, with her ultimate fate left unknown: people believe she was slain by either the tengu, the Shuumatsuban, or even the Iwakura Clan. Others claim that she encountered an "oni-masked, sword-bearing doll," likely referring to the Maguu Kenki.[1]

Trivia[]
Based on her appearance in Raiden Shogun's Character Teaser, Chiyo was right-handed. This also means she lost her right arm during her battle against the Raiden Shogun.
Some time before Chiyo was swallowed by a beast, she defeated the Otogi King when he challenged her to a wrestling match.[5]
Etymology[]
Her name Torachiyo (Japanese: 虎千代 lit. "Chiyo the Tiger") is likely a reference to the childhood name of the Japanese warlord Uesugi Kenshin (1530–1578), known as the "War God" for his military prowess.[6]
The Japanese name Chiyo (Japanese: 千代 "Eternal Prosperity," lit. "Thousand Generations") was a common male childhood name for the samurai class but is nowadays used as a female name. Furthermore, there is a widespread theory in popular history that Kenshin was a female (although never taken seriously by academic historians). Kenshin is therefore sometimes depicted as a female in popular culture.
