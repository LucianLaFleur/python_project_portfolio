Available after completing  Canticles of Harmony.‍[verification needed]


Tiepolo: Welcome, young one from afar. I welcome you in the name of the Consilium Sapientium. I am Petrichor's "Doge."
Tiepolo: If you trust the wisdom of an elder, then you may ask me anything.
 The Consilium Sapientium?
Tiepolo: Trust in the wisdom of the elderly is a tradition here. Since ancient times, all affairs in the town have been assessed by a committee of its elders.
Tiepolo: And of these elders, the most trustworthy would be selected as "Doge."
Tiepolo: And that is me, old and unskilled though I may be.
Tiepolo: Though given the role of overseer, I must say that there is little for me to oversee here. We live simple lives and have simple customs. All we do, we do by tradition.
 About Petrichor's customs...
Tiepolo: Petrichor is a romantic, idyllic place. People respect custom and are customarily polite and friendly to outside guests.
Tiepolo: Of course, some of us go a little overboard, and as a result may seem almost... wary, perhaps.
Tiepolo: But do forgive us. Petrichor is far from the Court of Fontaine, and people here have hardly ever left the town.
Tiepolo: Just as a stone thrown into an ancient well can stir up ripples, people always fear that outlanders may disturb our peace.
Tiepolo: So please, do not hold it against them!
 About Petrichor's history...
Tiepolo: Haha! Well, there's much to tell. Petrichor's got a history longer than the Court of Fontaine, after all — so long that ten operas wouldn't be enough to get through it all.
Tiepolo: Five hundred years ago, this place was still governed by the de Petrichor family, and their lineage had long ruled here.
Tiepolo: That had been the case ever since the first Duke appointed by Egeria, and they were, one and all, just and benevolent leaders who guided the town to ever-increasing prosperity.
Tiepolo: Alas, the final patrono of the family was transferred to be mayor of Poisson — there, he lost his life, and there did the family tree wither.
Tiepolo: For a time after, it seemed as though the town would become some abandoned fishing village... At least until after our first Doge Ruggiero established the Consilium Sapientium and restored our fortunes.
Tiepolo: The townspeople at that time believed that the town fell into ruin because of our relations with the outside world grew too close, destroying our traditions.
Tiepolo: That said, our youngsters believe differently nowadays. That fellow Foscari's been advocating that it's time for change, too.
 I don't have any questions. Goodbye.
Tiepolo: Alright. I do hope you shall enjoy your stay here.
