Idle Quotes[]

 Perfect spot...
Media:VO Gaiman 01.ogg "Perfect spot for a duel of epic proportions..."

Dialogue[]

Gaiman: Yes, this is the spot... the first grand master stood right here and narrowed his eyes into a cold stare, which he fixed firmly on the vile dragon before him...
 What are you doing?
Gaiman: I'm a novelist. Doing some research for my latest work.
Gaiman: I originally came to Liyue looking for the author of A Legend of Sword, but then I happened across some works on the rise and fall of the Guhua Clan...
Gaiman: I thought: "what a great topic to write about!" So, I've decided that I'm going to kick start my writing career with a swashbuckling Guhua masterpiece!
Gaiman: Chapter One opens with the grand master fighting the dragon! Did you know this was the very spot where he was standing...
 What's A Legend of Sword?
Gaiman: You know, it's a strange one. The author, Master Zhenyu, is huge in Inazuma and Fontaine. But no one in Liyue has ever heard of him, even though he was born and raised here.
Gaiman: The book is hands down a classic. There are plenty of copycat authors in Inazuma, but none has achieved anywhere near the same level of success. He is, as they say, inimitable...
 So, tell me about the Guhua Clan.
Gaiman: Well, it was once a flourishing organization in Liyue. Back then, they were even called the Guhua Brotherhood.
Gaiman: But now, there are few if any who would call themselves Guhua disciples.
Gaiman: I bought a batch of swords from someone who claimed to be a Guhua disciples [sic] some days back. He claimed that they were the Clan's hidden treasures.
Gaiman: But the boss at the smithy informed me two days later that they were just run-of-the-mill weapons.
Gaiman: *sigh* I didn't think that charlatans from Liyue could be so deceitful. Well, these swords are a burden to me as-is, so why don't you take them? Out of sight, out of mind, as they say!
(Obtain  Silver Sword ×2)
 Goodbye.
Gaiman: Farewell! Keep an eye out for my next novel, A Legend of Guhua. I'm gonna finish this one for sure!
