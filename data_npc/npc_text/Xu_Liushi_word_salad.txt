Dialogue[]
Before Hangout Event[]

Xu Liushi: Hey now, it's dangerous up here in the crow's nest. Don't come up here if you've no important business.
 Who might you be?
Xu Liushi: I'm the ship's lookout, Xu Liushi.
Xu Liushi: If you were older, you might've heard some tales about me...
Xu Liushi: ...not that it's anything worth talking about, of course.
 So, about those tales...
Xu Liushi: You ever hear the name Third-Round Knockout?
Xu Liushi: That place used to be some no-name watering hole. The specialty there was the wine-fermented sweet rice balls, but they were waxy and soft, and the wine was all there was to the soup...
Xu Liushi: I was young then, and I'd lost a bet with some folks. I had three bowls in a row... and got so plastered that I fell off the ship and into the sea, right as we were weighing anchor.
Xu Liushi: That incident gave pub its name, Third-Round Knockout. It also lost me my job.
Xu Liushi: No one wanted a sailor too deep into his bottle — only Captain Beidou was willing to give me a chance to turn over a new leaf.
Xu Liushi: ...And that's how it happened. I hope my story can serve as a lesson to you, traveler.
 How's the situation?
Xu Liushi: Huh, that reminds me, I did hear someone yelling from down below...
Xu Liushi: But the winds were too strong. Couldn't hear too well.
Xu Liushi: Everything looks normal. If something comes up, I'll ring.
 Later, then.
Xu Liushi: See you, and mind you don't fall!

After Hangout Event[]

Xu Liushi: Hello there, Traveler! Seeing as you've come all the way up here... Wanna revise the meteorology stuff I taught you previously?
 Tell me a little about yourself, please...
Xu Liushi: I'm the lookout on this here boat, Xu Liushi. That I've achieved all I have is thanks to Captain Beidou taking me in and instructing me.
Xu Liushi: *sigh* I mean, you  know the thing that happened to me at Third-Round Knockout.
Xu Liushi: That's what you get for being young and stupid, and losing a bet with some folks. I had three bowls of them wine-fermented sweet rice balls in a row... Got so plastered that I fell off the ship and into the sea, right as we were weighing anchor.
Xu Liushi: No one wanted a sailor too deep into his bottle — only Captain Beidou was willing to give me a chance to turn over a new leaf.
Xu Liushi: ...And that's how it happened. I hope my story can serve as a lesson to you, traveler.
 How's the situation?
Xu Liushi: Huh, that reminds me, I did hear someone yelling from down below...
Xu Liushi: But the winds were too strong. Couldn't hear too well.
Xu Liushi: If you have a look, I'm sure you'll see as well that everything looks normal. If something comes up, I'll ring.
 Later, then.
(Same as before)

Trivia[]
According to Little Yue, Liushi loves singing. Because he is usually located all the way on the crow's nest, the rest of the crew initially thought they were hearing a ghost.
