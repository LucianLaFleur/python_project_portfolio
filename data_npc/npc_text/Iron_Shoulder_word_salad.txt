Dialogue[]

Iron Shoulder: Well, you look free. Done for the day?
 Is there anything to note nearby?
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Iron Shoulder knows; Version 1)

Iron Shoulder: Now you mention it, a guy I work with said he'd seen some very peculiar Crystal Ore not far from here.
Iron Shoulder: They say this type's called Magical Crystal Ore. Some kind of special variety, a big step up from the usual stuff.
Iron Shoulder: If you're interested, you should go and look into it. Here, I'll mark the location for you...
Iron Shoulder: ...There. That's the rough area, anyway. Mining's a good, honest job — so off you go, maybe it'll do you some good!
(Rich Ore Reserves nearby marked on the map)
(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Iron Shoulder knows; Version 2)

Iron Shoulder: Now you mention it, a guy I work with said he'd seen some Crystal Ore not far from here.
Iron Shoulder: But work's so busy I don't have the time to check it out.
Iron Shoulder: If you're interested, you should go and look into it. Here, I'll mark the location for you...
Iron Shoulder: ...There. That's the rough area, anyway. Mining's a good, honest job — so off you go, maybe it'll do you some good!
(Rich Ore Reserves nearby marked on the map)
(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Iron Shoulder knows)

Iron Shoulder: Nothing I've noticed. Not in the last couple of days, anyway...
Iron Shoulder: But surely you must have more important things to do than sightseeing?
 About Rex Lapis' death...
(Probably after Rite of Descension)
Iron Shoulder: If we hadn't gone through with the Rite of Parting, I would have found it hard to believe that Rex Lapis is gone.
Iron Shoulder: I used to think that he alone would remain, even long after Liyu Harbor any of the seven nations had passed away.
Iron Shoulder: *sigh* I have no idea what his passing means for Liyue, or for the Blackcliff Forge... I just hope I won't lose my job!
 Done with work?
Iron Shoulder: Oh? You don't have a job? That won't do...
Iron Shoulder: You should find a job soon, or you might get too used to idling about.
Iron Shoulder: Once you've done work for over a decade like me, you'll slowly begin to understand your place in this world,
Iron Shoulder: You'll understand that you're just a normal person, but a single screw in Lapis' great work. Then you can be considered to have matured.
Iron Shoulder: If not, you'll become like those who roam the streets every day, never having grown out of being children despite their white hair.
 Well, you look quite idle yourself.
Iron Shoulder: It's called "catching your breath".
Iron Shoulder: I can do the work of three people in a single day. That's why everyone calls me "Iron Shoulder."
Iron Shoulder: I ply my trade faithfully at the Blackcliff Forge, and though we always hear some weird rumors drifting over from Liyue Harbor...
Iron Shoulder: Well, I don't pay them any mind. Liyue has prospered for a thousand years, and even if the sky were to fall, Rex Lapis would hold it up. What's the worst that could happen?
 See you.
Iron Shoulder: Indeed, let's cut the idle talk and get back to work.
