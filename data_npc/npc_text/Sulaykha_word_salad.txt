 Studying... making money...
Media:VO Sulaykha 01.ogg "Studying is far less fun than making money."

Thoughts[]
Sulaykha's thoughts can be accessed by using Nahida's Elemental Skill, All Schemes to Know.


Media:VO Sulaykha All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Sulaykha: (Hmph, that Dori had better watch her back! I'm gonna make more than her one day!)

Dialogue[]

Sulaykha: There's nothing wrong with loving money as long as you don't hurt anyone in the process of acquiring it, this much I understand.
Sulaykha: So, hehe, my customers don't need to worry about a thing when shopping here.
 Duel
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Sulaykha: I won, hehe... I feel I should be selling something related to Genius Invokation TCG!
(If the player wins the match)

Sulaykha: Whoa, you're probably the strongest player I've ever seen...
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

 And you are...
Sulaykha: I'm not just one of the best wooly blanket sellers, I'm THE best blanket seller.
Sulaykha: Heh, not only blankets, I will be the top sales, be it toys, jewelry or kitchen wares.
Sulaykha: ...Oh, but perhaps not books. This is Sumeru, after all.
 Not books?
Sulaykha: Yep, no books. I'm a law-abiding citizen, so even if smuggling knowledge could make me rich, I still wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole.
Sulaykha: After all, you can't keep making money when you're pushing up daisies.
Sulaykha: Besides, making money is easy. Even with half my talent, you should still be able to make as much as the Homayanis.
Sulaykha: Heh, if the Akademiya could have made an argument to get me to enroll that was half as convincing as my own sales pitch, I wouldn't have turned them down on the spot back then.
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

 You are...
Sulaykha: I'm not just one of the best woolly blanket sellers, I'm *the* best blanket seller, period.
Sulaykha: And not only do I sell blankets... I am, surely as I live, also the top in sales for toys, jewelry, and kitchen wares.
Sulaykha: ...Oh, but perhaps not books.
 Not books?
Sulaykha: Eh, books are just a non-starter. With Akasha's shutdown, the Akademiya is sure to revise the way they manage books.
Sulaykha: Not like I ever like those things anyway, so nope, those waters are not for me. I'll just stick to the basics.
Sulaykha: Besides, making Mora is easy. Even with half my talent, you should still be able to make as much as the Homayanis.
Sulaykha: Heh, if the Akademiya could have made an argument to get me to enroll that was half as convincing as my sales pitches back then, I wouldn't have turned them down on the spot.
 See you.
Sulaykha: Bye! You're welcome back even if you don't buy anything!
