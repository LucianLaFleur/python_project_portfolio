Anastasia is part of the Fatui delegation sent to Mondstadt. She is seen advising Jean to kill Dvalin to end the threat it poses to Mondstadt, threatening that the Fatui will take over the defense of Mondstadt if the Knights of Favonius cannot handle the situation. Jean rebukes her, stating that she is disrespecting Mondstadt by making plans to kill one of its Four Winds. This prompts Anastasia to leave, claiming that she is merely trying to offer "constructive opinions."[1]
