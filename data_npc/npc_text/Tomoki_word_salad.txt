 Creative cooking!
Media:VO Tomoki 01.ogg "Come and try some creative cooking!"

Dialogue[]

Tomoki: Don't miss out on Inazuma's creative cuisine!
(Unlocked after completing Reflections of Mortality)
 One Dango Milk, please!
Tomoki: One Dango Milk, coming right up!
(Opens the Shop menu)
 Adventure Challenge
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Tomoki: Playing cards is like cooking. If you're creative enough, you'll win for sure!
(If the player wins the match)

Tomoki: Eh... Failure is but a part of innovation...
 How's the Dango Milk doing?
Tomoki: Thanks to our Almighty Shogun, the number of people who came to buy some Dango Milk went up significantly. They all think it's pretty good, too.
Tomoki: I've given it a little thought, and given the kind of business we've been doing recently, there'd be no problem switching to just selling Dango Milk. Still, I love experimenting more...
Tomoki: I originally wanted to replace Dango Milk with some new creative dish, but my customers all missed its flavor. So after discussing it with them, I decided to return Dango Milk to the menu every so often.
Tomoki: As it turns out, it sold even better that way! Sometimes I couldn't even keep up with the demand, haha!
(Unlocked by default)
 Creative cuisine?
Tomoki: Heh heh, that's right! You see, this street is filled with old, famous shops that serve people the same old stuff all the time!
Tomoki: So I thought that something creative and new might attract a real crowd!
Tomoki: Aside from ordinary takoyaki and sushi, I've also added creative cuisines into the menu.
Tomoki: These are my pride and joy: Milky Natto Ramen, Colorful Spicy Dango... What do you think? Sounds delicious, no?
 How's business doing?
Tomoki: Erm... I am new to cooking, after all. It'd be best if I took things one step at a time...
Tomoki: Though my dishes may sound a little strange, everyone who's tried it has said that they taste pretty good.
Tomoki: Sir Kamisato of the Yashiro Commission visited my shop last time and took a liking to our milk tea!
Tomoki: However, perhaps the mix of foods is a little too strange, because we rarely get any returning guests. I suppose people are still too used to ordinary cuisine...
Tomoki: Seems like I need to put more work into how I promote all this creativity...
 Goodbye.
Tomoki: If you ever get bored of ordinary food, be sure to come check out the new stuff here! See ya!

Event Dialogue[]
Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness[]

 We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.
Tomoki: Hmm? How did you know I liked music? ... Well, to be truthful, that's where I get most of my creative ideas!
Paimon: Ooh, then you must have music you really enjoy, right? We could play it for you!
Tomoki: Oh, that's a long list you'd be looking at... If I had to pick one, it might be this traditional piece from Konda Village.
Tomoki: That's where I started my culinary journey, in fact.
Tomoki: Could you play the piece if I were to hum the tune for you?
 Sure, I'll give it a go.
Tomoki: Thanks!
(After performing)
Tomoki: Absolutely fantastic!
Tomoki: If not for the way you dress, I'd have suspected that you were from Konda Village yourself. It sounded just like the original!
Tomoki: Alright, I've decided. I'm heading to this festival. Maybe immersing myself in the music there might give me some new ideas.
Tomoki: I'll move my food stall over there — not that my skills are the most impressive, but I'm sure I'll add to the atmosphere at least, eh?
(Talk to Tomoki again, optional)
 How was that?
(Same as After performing)

(After he moves to the event location at Watatsumi Island)
Tomoki: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! This "Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness" you recommended really is awesome. I've been inspired!
Tomoki: Now have a taste of the food I made specifically for the event!
 What kind of creative cuisine is that?
Tomoki: Dango Milk that's been marinated in rock, and macerated in roll — Rock 'n' Roll Dango Milk! Here, have one on me.
 It's just regular Dango Milk, right?
Tomoki: I wouldn't go that far! At least, it might have been to begin with, but not after hearing all that rock 'n' roll that I made it listen to.
Tomoki: That's also why it now tastes like regular Dango Milk that's been lying around for a while.
Tomoki: But this way, some customers are even willing to pay double the price of regular Dango Milk just to get their hands on this stuff.
Tomoki: Must be the power of rock 'n' roll, eh? It's so mind-blowing that I can't even put it into words.
(Obtain  Rock 'n' Roll Dango Milk ×1)
 One Dango Milk, please!
Tomoki: One Dango Milk, coming right up!
