Dialogue[]

Charles: What'll it be today?
 I'd like to buy something to drink.
Charles: Here's the menu. Let me know once you're ready to order.
(Opens Angel's Share menu)
 About Stormterror...
(After completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
Charles: It's been quite the headache for sure. Stormterror's affected our tavern's supply routes, so the variety of wines here has also dropped...
Charles: As for Stormterror itself, I'm not too worried. I think those people who numb themselves with alcohol are just scared out of their wits.
Charles: But we do reach the point of no return, then we just need to wait for night to fall.
Charles: The "Knight Who Emerges At Night" will not just stand idly by..
(After completing A Long Shot)
Charles: Well, what's passed has passed, I say.
Charles: Life isn't all sweet fruit juice. It also needs some bitter alcohol. These incidents will also become part of our experience.
Charles: Rather than ask how this could happen, we should look forward to the future. Accepting the bitter with the sweet is how adults do things.
Charles: Once you're ready for the bitter, I'll pour you a special brew.
 Any recommendations?
Charles: The apple cider from the Dawn Winery is a special at Angel's Share.
Charles: You can try my special cocktail if you want. The cocktail is on the house if it's your first time here.
 What sort of liquor is the best?
Charles: If you like strong wine, then I'd recommend that you try Death After Noon. It's Captain Kaeya's favorite.
Charles: But the strongest wine I know has to be the one called Fire-Water.
Charles: It hails from Snezhnaya, and was brought into Mondstadt by Snezhnayan merchants, but Master Diluc stopped importing it, saying that it didn't fit the tastes of the people here.
Charles: The only remaining bottle is from the original batch. It's for display purposes only, though, so you'll have to go to Snezhnaya if you want to try some.
 Tell me about yourself.
Charles: You want to know about me?
Charles: I've been working as a bartender here for more than a decade. I'm employed by the Dawn Winery, like everyone else.
Charles: I'm not that interested in alcohol, but it's my job so...
Charles: I mean, I'm not like Diona at Cat's Tail. I heard she hates alcohol.
Charles: Occasionally, Master Diluc, the owner of the winery, will cover my shift.
Charles: Days off are precious after all, so I'm very thankful to him for that.
 Not right now, thanks.
Charles: Really? Shouldn't drink too much anyway I guess.

Event Dialogue[]
Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness[]

 We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.
Charles: Haha, you, coming with an invitation? What's the occasion? Has Master Diluc decided to give me the day off?
Paimon: No, this is about a musical exchange taking place in Inazuma! If there's a song you like, we can play it for you right now.
Charles: A song I like, you say? Hmm... I do remember Head Housemaid Adelinde hosting several small family concerts at Dawn Winery.
Charles: They played a song at those gatherings that I do quite like. I'll do my best to hum it for you. Mind playing the song after that?
 Sure, I'll give it a go.
Charles: In that case, do excuse my amateurishness...
(After performing)
Charles: Very impressive. In fact, I should recommend to Adelinde that you be commissioned to play at the next such family event.
Charles: As for your invitation... To be honest, I was just about ready to agree the moment you finished your performance.
Charles: But I'm not sure if I'd want to ask Master Diluc for a day off over something this trivial — after all, he'd agree without hesitation.
Charles: How about this, then? I'll send you a token of support for your festival. Will that do?
 So you'll be sending us several crates of wine?
Charles: Haha, I doubt everyone who'll be attending the festival will be of drinking age.
Charles: As such, I'll give you some decorative banners instead. We've got them stocked in the winery warehouse — and I believe they'll come in quite handy.
Charles: Don't worry, you won't have to go fetch them yourselves. I'll have some of our traders deliver it directly.
Charles: Just consider it the "Angel's Share."
(Talk to Charles again, optional)
 How was that?
(Same as After performing)

Of Drink A-Dreaming[]

Charles: Do you need a hand with anything?
 I'd like to take part in the bartender challenge.
Charles: Looks like you're ready. In that case, let us begin.
(Opens Bartender Challenge screen)
 I'd like to come up with a new mix.
Charles: Sure. We've already restocked on ingredients, so please, feel free — let your imagination run wild!
(Opens drink mixing screen)
 See you around.
Charles: No problem. If you ever need any help, just come and look for me.
