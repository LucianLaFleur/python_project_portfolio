Aria, Sonnet, and Canon,[1] collectively known as the three sisters[2][3] or the moon sisters (unofficial name), are ancient goddesses[4] in Teyvat mythos alongside the ancient Seelie race. Following a certain great calamity, two of the sisters died,[5] and one of their corpses continues to illuminate the night sky.[2]

Just as legends claim that [...] once there were three bright moons in the night sky named Aria, Sonnet and Canon, sisters who were parted by death in a great catastrophe.—Heart's Desire: Sapphire
The three sisters are mythical figures in Teyvat legends who have been mentioned in books and legends from — and in item descriptions related to — Mondstadt, Liyue, and Sumeru. However, very little of their mythos can be confirmed, leaving their significance and role in Teyvat lore a mystery.
Most tales involving them agree that the three sisters lived in the Lunar Palace[6] and switched places in riding their silver carriage[2] (or chariot)[4] at regular intervals. The three sisters were close with each other and were also in love with the "stars of daybreak,"[2] but met their end as a result of a great calamity.[1] Stories differ, or do not address, why the sisters died or how many of them died.

Story[]
According to legend, the moon sisters are older than Rex Lapis,[2][7] who himself is over 6,000 years old.[8] They were the sovereigns of the night sky who dwelled in the Lunar Palace and rode through the heavens in a silver carriage. Sovereignty was held by one sister at a time, switching places three times a month.[Note 1] The three sisters were all in love with the morning stars, and it is said that their love for the morning stars was "equal" to the affection between the sisters.[2]

The Ancient Calamity[]
At some point, the Lunar Palace was host to the union of a Seelie ancestor and a traveler from afar, with the moon sisters as witnesses. Thirty days later, the calamity that overturned the heavens and earth descended on the world: the lovers went on a self-imposed exile and attempted to flee, but the disaster caught up to them. As punishment, the two were separated for eternity and had their memories wiped. The heartbroken Seelie withered away, shedding parts of their former selves which then transformed into the Seelie's current wispy forms.[6]
Meanwhile, the great disaster overturned the sisters' carriage and ransacked the palace of the stars. According to one tale, the moon sisters turned on each other and killed each other, although other similar legends do not include this detail. Two sisters died, and one of their corpses became the moon in Teyvat's night sky.[2] Around the same time as their deaths, the sun chariot piloted by the morning stars fell into the plains west of Liyue, creating The Chasm and Dunyu Ruins.[7][9]
It is heavily implied that this disaster is related to Nibelung's great war of vengeance against the Heavenly Principles,[10] which was the same conflict which caused the Seelie to be cursed and exiled.[11]

Legacy[]
Following her sisters' deaths, the last sister was so overcome with sorrow that she never left her palace again.[3]
The morning stars survived the calamities, as did the wolves, who are said to be "children of the moons." The wolves remember the tragedy behind the sisters' tale, and those who live among wolves call the morning stars the "grievous stars." Gods and adepti that heard the story of the moon sisters would "feel sentimental upon hearing such ancient memories."[2]
Nilotpala Lotuses are said to be related to the three sisters, hence why they bloom during nighttime.[3][4]
The concept of the moon(s) recurs throughout Teyvat lore and shows up both in-universe and in gameplay elements. For example, the names "Mondstadt" and "Liyue" both make reference to the word moon via Mond and Yue, respectively. According to folk legends, the Solar Chariot that fell into The Chasm was repaired by the tribespeople who lived there and eventually returned to the heavens;[7] in other renditions of the tale, the sun chariot was a star which "leaped away" and returned to the heavens during the time "countless gods and rulers fought over the appointed celestial seats."[9]
The Spiral Abyss, a massive underground city built by a ruined civilization, has several deep connections with the moon(s): Within it is a structure known as the Abyssal Moon Spire, in which the moon is clearly visible. The lunar phase within the city shifts twice a month in a phenomenon known as the Moment of Syzygy, which brings new rewards with it, and this change in lunar phase has been referred to as "gears turn[ing]."[12] Notably, the moon above Teyvat and the one within the Spiral Abyss are distinct, perhaps suggesting that while one sister's corpse ended up in Teyvat, the other sister's corpse ended up in the Spiral Abyss.

Trivia[]
The concept of the triple goddess is common in real-life mythology and may be the inspiration behind the moon sisters.
The English localization of Moonlit Bamboo Forest (III) states that disaster would befall the world if the three sisters failed to switch places in time. This is a major misinterpretation of the original Chinese text, which says that they continued switching places up until the great disaster descended. (See Moonlit Bamboo Forest § Notes for details.)
Another notable translation liberty occurs later, with "But this was all before the world was smashed against the tides of great calamity." The original Chinese text says 那是颠覆天地的大灾降临之前的事情了 "Of course, this was before the disaster that toppled heaven and earth descended."
The figure depicted in the Blessing of the Welkin Moon card may relate to the moon sisters. It features an unidentified white-haired, purple-robed feminine figure surrounded by Primogems, with an upright triquetra underneath and a waning crescent moon behind her. The word "welkin" means "sky" or "heaven," making the name of this moon the "Heavenly Moon."
Etymology[]
The moon sisters' names are related to music and poetry:
An aria is a musical composition for a single singer, with or without musical accompaniment. It is most often used in operas.
A sonnet is a type of poetic form closely associated with love poems. It is derived from the Italian word sonetto, meaning "little song."
A canon is a compositional form in which the melody is repeated by an imitation after a given duration.
Both the Chinese and Japanese language patches render Sonnet as "Sonata". This may have been an oversight in localization, as a sonata is a form of musical piece much like an aria and a canon, as opposed to a sonnet, which is a form of poetry.
In astronomy, "syzygy" is the configuration of three celestial bodies in a straight line. One commonly-known type of syzygy is an eclipse.
In the Valentinianism system of Gnosticism, "syzygy" refers to the duo male and female emanations of God.

Notes[]

↑ Instead of saying that the sisters alternated "thrice a month," the original Chinese text says they alternated after "one xún" (Chinese: 一旬), where a xún can mean ten days, ten years, or an unspecified amount of time. The English localization assumed ten days, as thirty days roughly comprises one lunar month.
