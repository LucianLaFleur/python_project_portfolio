Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Jacquetta: I don't get it. Don't those two leaders sit in the same office — in fact, don't they sit at adjoining tables? Why are their views different?
Isadora: It might be a communication issue...
Jacquetta: And every time I try to get a signature, if they aren't both missing, then one will ask me to get a second opinion from the other. I mean, would it kill them to get their story straight first!?
Isadora: Then maybe they don't have a good relationship...
(If Archon Quest Chapter IV: Act V - Masquerade of the Guilty has not been completed)

Jacquetta: Also, more and more people are growing dissatisfied with the Palais's inaction regarding the "prophecy." One of the construction teams has even gone on strike...
Jacquetta: I mean, prophecies can't really be verified — we've got more practical problems to deal with!
Jacquetta: [sic] Yeah, that's true...
(If Masquerade of the Guilty has been completed)

Jacquetta: There's been a lot of work to do regarding rebuilding and repairing the flood damage lately.
Jacquetta: The excitement of not having been dissolved didn't last long, and now a pile of other problems have surfaced that need to be dealt with...
Isadora: Yeah, that's true...

Nighttime[]

Isadora: Some problems might have been fated to be intractable... I suspect we've all got to make our own choices.
 You seem a little down.
Isadora: Heh... I'm not sure I'd say that, but at the same time, it's been a while since I last considered myself happy.
Isadora: I'm an auditor here at the Palais. My work is confidential, so I can't really unburden myself of my complaints to anyone.
Isadora: Of course, I fully intend to follow the rules, but sometimes I really do wish I had someone to talk to.
Isadora: Maybe I need to take another approach — learn to live with those things that don't go smoothly.
 Sorry that I couldn't help.
Isadora: No, it's okay. It is good enough to chat under such a serene night sky. Thank you.
Isadora: Good night and sweet dreams.
(Obtain  Rainbow Rose ×4)
 Best of luck to you.
Isadora: And to you.
