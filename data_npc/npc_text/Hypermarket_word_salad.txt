Dialogue[]

Hypermarket: Hello, you look like a traveler to me. Need to stock up on any essentials?
Hypermarket: We've got everything you could possibly think of in here, and more.
 Do you sell artifacts?
Hypermarket: ...Ah, everything except those.
Hypermarket: Those you'd find in a museum or Cathedral... Hardly what you'd call 'essentials,' [sic] no?
 So much for 'everything I could possibly think of.' [sic]
Hypermarket: B—But... I said 'essentials' [sic]! If you class those as essential then I'm not sure what to say...
Hypermarket: Anyway, I sell things that by most people's definition would fall under 'travel essentials.' [sic]
Hypermarket: You've piqued my curiosity though. What exactly does your journey entail?
 As I thought, your branding is a sham...
Hypermarket: T—This... I can't lose my branding just because of you...
Hypermarket: Wait! Do you need food? It doesn't matter who you are, surely you have some needs!
Hypermarket: Here, take these Matsutake Meat Rolls. See, I do have something you need here with me!
Hypermarket: This... This was food that I brought with me. There's only one of it, and it's free, so please, just leave me alone...
(Obtain  Matsutake Meat Rolls ×4)
 Do you sell legendary weaponry?
Hypermarket: ...Ah, everything except that.
Hypermarket: Many travelers carry a run-of-the-mill sword or dagger on them, but not legendary weaponry... Are you sure you're just a regular traveler?
 So much for 'everything I could possibly think of.' [sic]
Hypermarket: B—But... I said 'essentials' [sic]! If you class those as essential then I'm not sure what to say...
Hypermarket: Anyway, I sell things that by most people's definition would fall under 'travel essentials.' [sic]
Hypermarket: You've piqued my curiosity though. What exactly does your journey entail?
 Do you sell poison?
Hypermarket: ...Ah, everything except that. I don't dare...
Hypermarket: That would never fly with the Millelith — or what, did you have some contacts you were planning on hooking me up with? Not just anyone can sell that stuff, you know...
 So much for 'everything I could possibly think of.' [sic]
Hypermarket: B—But... I said 'essentials' [sic]! If you class those as essential then I'm not sure what to say...
Hypermarket: Anyway, I sell things that by most people's definition would fall under 'travel essentials.' [sic]
Hypermarket: You've piqued my curiosity though. What exactly does your journey entail?
 Goodbye.
Hypermarket: Come again soon! Remember, we stock everything you could possibly think of — and more!
