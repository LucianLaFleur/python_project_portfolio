Takuya is a blue oni. He was aware of the Inazuman fairytale regarding the blue and crimson oni, resulting in him and his fellow blue oni living in a life of misery as they could not rely on humans for support. As a result, he chose to abandon his pride to support his people. Nogata, the leader of a ronin group, presumably invited him for his raw strength which Takuya accepted, but only on the condition that no innocent people be killed, causing significant friction among Nogata's men. Nogata's men kidnapped many people, but Takuya did his best to provide them with extra food and water behind the vagrants' backs. When the vagrants ambushed the traveling merchant Masato, Takuya prevented them from killing him and they simply took his goods.
As the people of Inazuma believed the blue oni to have died off, Takuya was not considered a suspect as the crimson oni, Arataki Itto, claimed to be responsible so he could figure out why Takuya had resorted to a life of crime. With the aid of the Traveler, Itto learned that Takuya held a grudge against him for not upholding their ancient pact as he and his brethren were suffering immensely, believing that Itto was forsaking the pact. He fled into Nogata's hideout, but when the leader attempted to blow the hideout up, he immediately changed sides as a result of the blatant violation of his agreement for joining the group and to sacrifice himself to atone for his sins. Itto later saved him from getting crushed and the two made their way out, where they were arrested by Tenryou Commission soldiers for their crimes. Itto reassured Takuya that he would have someone take care of his people until they were released from jail.
