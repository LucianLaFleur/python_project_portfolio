Trivia
The name "Sir Pouncealot" in some localization may be a reference to Ser Pounce-a-lot from the Dragon Age franchise, which also happens to be a ginger cat.
Daju can be fed with a special fish. This motivates the cat to show the Traveler an Exquisite Chest. The fish can be found in the mouth of the pelican called Dadao which is located on the docks of Qiaoying Village.
