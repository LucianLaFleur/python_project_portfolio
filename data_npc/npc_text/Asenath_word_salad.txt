Media:VO Asenath All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Asenath: (Animal noggins... They're just so adorable... Oooh, I wanna pet their cute little heads so much...)

Dialogue[]

Asenath: Hehe... Animal noggins are so adorable...
 Looking for desert foxes?
Asenath: Ah, hello there. Judging by your attire, you must be the Traveler, yes?
Asenath: Hehe, of course I know you! You're a real celebrity — everyone's heard at least a little about you.
Asenath: Your friends, Mr. Cyno and Mr. Tighnari, are really famous themselves.
Asenath: I was just looking for a way to see Desert Foxes more often. They're so cute, I can't help wanting to see them more! If only there was some way to make them less skittish around me, so I could touch their tails and...
 I didn't know you liked them so much.
Asenath: It's not just them — all animals fascinate me! I suppose that it's an occupational hazard, though. After all, King Deshret's Seven Pillars are all animal-associated one way or the other, right?
Asenath: As I read these books, I slowly developed a deep interest in animals...
Asenath: The Goat King, Crocodile King, Ibis King... Large animals all! And their heads...
Asenath: Yup, yup... So cute...
Asenath: Animals just have such adorable heads!
 They all sound pretty famous.
Asenath: That's right. The associated literature indicates that the Dragon King, the supreme spirit Apep, was alone amongst the Seven Pillars in not appearing in person.
Asenath: Of the remaining six, these were most important: The Goat King Heryshaf, Minister of Ministers, the Crocodile King Sobek, Captain of Captains, the Ibis King Thoth, Scribe of Scribes...
Asenath: And Hermanubis, greatest of sages.
Asenath: As for the other two, Bennu Most-Radiant and Shesepankh Most-Holy, the texts claim that they refer more to "human souls" and "Jinni."
Asenath: Speaking of Jinni, it's just a shame that I was born this late. I'd love to have seen a legendary being like that in the flesh.
Asenath: Err, sorry, I said that out loud, didn't I?
Asenath: I'd originally intended to just share some ancient knowledge — I've always loved these "names and titles" bridging segments in books! Especially when someone starts to rattle theirs off...
Asenath: And the best titles are slightly on the long side.
 Thanks for the lesson!
Asenath: Oh, come now, don't say that.
Asenath: Have you been coming around often lately? We should go see some Desert Foxes together if you've got the time — and some other animals too!
