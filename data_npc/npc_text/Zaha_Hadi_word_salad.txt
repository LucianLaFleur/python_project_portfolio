Profile[]
Zaha Hadi is a renowned architect and former Kshahrewar lecturer. She is a leading expert in formal garden design and published many works during her career, with Kaveh having learned a lot by studying her essays.
Among her students was Faranak, mother of Kaveh, although she was also familiar with Kaveh's Father. As well, upon meeting Kaveh in Bimarstan, she comments on his personality and physical growth in ways that suggest she has known him since he was a child, with this likely implying that she remained Faranak's close friend and confidant even after she graduated from the Akademiya and started a family.
Now retired, she spends her time around the Bimarstan area and participates in a vegetable growing competition with other retirees such as Cyrus out of boredom. Kaveh seeks her out during his Story Quest to learn more about his mother in hopes of finding the key to unlocking his mothers diary, and she shares several memories of Faranak and expresses her perspective on Faranak's relationship with Kaveh's father.
She also imparts wisdom on the struggles that Kshahrewar architects face in order to achieve their goals while sacrificing their own happiness.
At the end of their interaction, she also requests that Kaveh relax the formalities with her and offers to discuss architectural topics with Kaveh in the future.
