Profile[]
Vautrin was the Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol at the time the Melusines first joined Fontainian society. Vautrin worked together with Carole, a member of the newly-formed Marechaussee Phantom, in order to foster goodwill and cooperation. Alongside common distrust of Melusines, many people also did not trust Neuvillette due to his mysterious circumstances, and a group of hardliners opposed to him decided to frame Carole for a crime she did not commit to teach Neuvillette a lesson for upstaging the old regime.
The hardliners of the old regime, such as Thibert and Suavegothe, successfully lured Carole to the crime scene and accused her of murder, inciting a crowd of people into ordering her detention. The Gardes were unsuccessful at keeping the mob at bay, resulting in a clash between both sides. To prove her innocence, Carole sacrificed herself by committing suicide. Vautrin, who saw Carole similarly to his sister Illaria who also died young, was enraged by her self-sacrifice and sought revenge on the hardliners, killing them to exact his own form of justice.[3]
During his trial, Neuvillette declared Vautrin guilty for abusing his authority and conducting extralegal executions, at which Vautrin expressed outrage. But in truth, Vautrin's anger was feigned; he hoped that by demonstrating Neuvillette's impartiality and fairness, he would be able to solidify his — and by extension, the Melusines' — place in Fontainian society. After being sent to Fortress of Meropide, Vautrin established the Mutual Aid Society, which used a design similar to Vautrin's Medal of Peace as their badge for the next 400 years.[4]
