Dialogue[]

Ashpazi: Even an idiot can cook awesome food with this fresh meat!
 I'd like some fresh meat too.
Ashpazi: Aha, looks like you know your stuff. Just pick whatever you want!
(Opens Shop menu)
 You can cook?
Ashpazi: Ahem, what kind of question is that?
Ashpazi: Don't look down on my culinary expertise just because I'm wearing a Forest Watcher's uniform! I'm the renowned "Master Chef" of the Forest Rangers!
Ashpazi: ...Haha, alright, alright, that's enough jokes for now.
Ashpazi: Still, even if I'm not truly "renowned," my culinary skill is pretty extraordinary. Everyone praises it once they try it.
 I don't believe it.
Ashpazi: You got a problem with me, pal?
Ashpazi: But you don't look anything like an unreasonable oaf.
Ashpazi: Oh, I get it! You're using reverse psychology to get a free meal out of me!
Ashpazi: That's okay, I don't mind falling for tricks when it comes to sharing food.
Ashpazi: I have only one request. Just spread the good word about my food if you like it.
(Obtain  Shawarma Wrap ×3)
 You can hunt?
Ashpazi: Of course. Where do you think the meat I sell comes from? Did you think stupid boars rush at me and ram their heads against my arrows?
Ashpazi: ...Haha, that's enough jokes. After being with Mr. Tighnari for so long, even the way he speaks has rubbed off on me.
Ashpazi: I oversee logistics for the Forest Rangers, so knowing how to hunt and cook is perfectly normal, right?
Ashpazi: In my opinion, the first step to being a good chef is to be a good hunter.
 See you.
Ashpazi: See you. Come again if you feel like having some meat!
