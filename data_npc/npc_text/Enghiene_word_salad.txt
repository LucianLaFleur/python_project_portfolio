Enghiene is an officer from the Maison Gardiennage and a veteran member of the Gardes. She was Turenna's drillmaster before she joined the Special Patrol.
During the Event Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta, she takes over Turenna's duty to watch over the Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta preview event after Turenna received new orders from the Special Patrol. She is also enjoying the game. She also fell in love with the Fungi, especially Bongo-Head and Kindlejoy, because of their similar characteristics to Tidalga.
During the Event Dance of Resolute Will, she confronted Costentin for unauthorized investigation of the domain he found and for not declaring his use of weapons to the Maison Gardiennage. She takes him to the Maison Gardiennage to issue him a verbal warning.
