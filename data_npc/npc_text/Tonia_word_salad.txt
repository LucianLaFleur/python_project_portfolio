Profile[]
Tonia is the third-youngest child in her large family, only older than Teucer and Anthon. She is extremely close with Tartaglia and holds him in high regard.[1] He, in turn, is deeply fond of her and always writes to her when he sends letters home, in which he addresses her as "Dearest Sister" and himself as her "loyal knight."[2][3]
During Labyrinth Warriors, Tartaglia takes fondly to Xinyan's form of address for him — Brother — as it reminds him of Tonia.[4]

He treats me just like family. Oh, and speaking of family — Tonia and Teucer are always telling me about the pastries and other gifts he brings them when they write. So while I've been away from Snezhnaya, he's kept his promise to take care of my family.More About Tartaglia: III Media:VO_Tartaglia More About Tartaglia - 03.ogg Media:VO ZH_Tartaglia More About Tartaglia - 03.ogg Media:VO JA_Tartaglia More About Tartaglia - 03.ogg Media:VO KO_Tartaglia More About Tartaglia - 03.ogg However far away my motherland may be, we all live under the same sky.

Trivia[]
In the original Chinese dialogue for Labyrinth Warriors, Xinyan calls Tartaglia 小哥 xiǎogē, lit. "young big brother," which is a form of address for young men who are slightly older than the addresser, regardless of familial relation. When referring to a family member, 小哥 refers to the youngest of one's older brothers — which Tartaglia is to Tonia — although she typically uses 哥哥 gēgē, "big brother" to refer to him.
Etymology[]
Anthon and Tonia are both names derived from Anthony, itself derived from the surname Antony which is said to have been named after the descendants of Anton, a son of Heracles.
