Dialogue[]

Jalade: I can't keep working here. Maybe I should try relocating to Romaritime Harbor?
 Why can't you stay in Lumidouce Harbor?
Jalade: Ah, right. You're not working here, so you probably don't know.
Jalade: This place is far from the Court of Fontaine, and we're not exactly swimming in choices for shops or recreation of any kind, really. There's only one tavern, but I'm not a big drinker.
 So, where are you going?
Jalade: I... I haven't decided yet.
Jalade: I can't really go to Romaritime Harbor. It's directly adjacent to the desert, and my friend who works there told me that the wind is always blowing in a bunch of sand.
Jalade: If I get blasted by that wind for too long, my skin would surely become a grotesque horror show.
Jalade: I suppose if all else fails, I can always look for a job back in the city...
 About Doutey...
Jalade: Mr. Doutey is a good guy. He's really diligent and friendly, and always puts others first.
Jalade: Having said that, the man is a bit too obsessed with reports, data sheets, and meeting minutes.
Jalade: I half-suspect the main reason he proposed to expand Lumidouce Harbor was so that he could immerse himself in a deluge of meetings every day.
 See you.
Jalade: In any case, I wish you a pleasant stay in Lumidouce Harbor. Goodbye.
