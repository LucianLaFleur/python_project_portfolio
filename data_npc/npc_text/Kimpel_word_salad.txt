 This isn't any good...
Media:VO Kimpel 01.ogg Kimpel: The situation in Lumidouce Harbor is no good.

Dialogue[]

Kimpel: How did Lumidouce Harbor end up like this... it's just terrible.
 What's wrong with Lumidouce Harbor?
Kimpel: Look at all those ships down there. Do you think there are more vessels from Fontaine or other places?
Kimpel: Once, there were more Fontainian ships in the harbor. I don't know when it started, but at some point, there were more foreign ships instead.
Kimpel: If this continues, can this harbor still be considered Fontaine's harbor?
 Lumidouce Harbor isn't the only harbor in Fontaine...
Kimpel: I know, I know. But Lumidouce Harbor is an essential port. A vast quantity of international trade passes through here.
Kimpel: However, not even the big cargo ships have been coming through the harbor much lately...
Kimpel: I won't bother you with it now. I need to continue writing this advisory letter to Ms. Cassigneul. She should be able to turn things around here.
 Goodbye.
Kimpel: Goodbye. Hmm, how should I start this advisory letter...
