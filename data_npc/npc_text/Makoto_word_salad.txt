Raiden Makoto (Japanese: 雷電眞 Raiden Makoto), also known by her Goetic name Baal, was the original Electro Archon of Inazuma, and predecessor to her younger twin sister, Ei. Makoto's divine ideal was also "eternity," but rather than Ei's pursuit of solemn stillness, Makoto cherished each moment within time and space.[Note 1]
Makoto was one of the casualties in the cataclysm 500 years ago. Since then, Ei has assumed the Shogunate.

Introduction[]
Makoto and Ei were identical twin gods who lived during the time of the Archon War. While Ei was a far more formidable warrior than the peaceful Makoto, Ei believed Makoto to be a better ruler for humanity. After prevailing and slaying all their rivals, Ei willingly sacrificed her body so Makoto could ascend to Celestia and become one of The Seven. After becoming the first Electro Archon, Makoto recreated Ei's body and made Ei her kagemusha (Japanese: 影武者 "shadow warrior"), or body double.[1] As far as the world was aware, there were not two, but one. They complemented each other, and they ruled Inazuma jointly; therefore, there was no need for the public to know the truth. The name "Baal" and the title of Raiden Shogun were understood to refer to both of them.

Story[]
History[]
Alongside her sister Ei, the two prevailed during the Archon War and ruled Inazuma justly, with all those living under their domain doing so in peace. Makoto agreed to let Ei serve as her kagemusha and met with the original Seven from time to time in Liyue. When governing Inazuma, Makoto presumably handled general affairs, while Ei would handle those that would require force.
The two would live in relative peace until the cataclysm 500 years prior to the start of the game, when monsters began appearing across Inazuma and leaving mass trails of destruction in their wake. Makoto headed to Khaenri'ah alone without informing Ei, as she was compelled to do so. By the time Ei found Makoto in Khaenri'ah, she had already fallen unconscious in the ensuing battle and was dying; however, Ei was able to save part of her consciousness and moved it to a torii gate underneath the Grand Narukami Shrine. Before her physical death, Makoto had also imbued part of the Musou Isshin with her consciousness that would only awaken when Ei had used its full power, and also spawned the Sacred Sakura on top of Mt. Yougou. Ei would use the Sacred Sakura to destroy the monsters terrorizing Inazuma.
After defeating the Shogun in a grueling duel, Makoto's consciousness spawned from the sword due to Ei using its full power. She apologized to Ei for leaving her so suddenly, having intended to slowly convince her of her views over time but could not as she could not ignore Khaenri'ah. Before the last of her consciousness faded away, she handed Ei a seed of the Sacred Sakura and lamented that she could not see what Inazuma looked like in the present day. Ei believed that Makoto had Istaroth involved in the creation of the Sacred Sakura and that without her intervention, Inazuma would have been consumed by the darkness.

This world is transient, people come and go. The fun times we shared, our companionship, and the delicious foods we got to savor — those emotions and experiences are real things that existed at some point in time, not just empty concepts.Paimon: Even though...

Trivia[]
"Makoto" (Japanese: 真) literally means "real" or "true", alluding to her role as the "true" Shogun; this is also reflected in her sister and body double's name, as "Ei" (Japanese: 影) literally means "shadow".
In the demonology grimoire The Lesser Key of Solomon, "Baal" (also spelled Bael) is the first King of Hell. Also listed in the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, Bael has the power to make men invisible and holds estates in the east.
In ancient Mesopotamian religions, there was a storm and rain god that was sometimes referred to as "Baal-zephon" (Hebrew: בַּעַל צְפֹן Baʿal Ṣəfōn), often simplified to "Baal" (Hebrew: בַּעַל Baʿal), a title used in the Northwest Semitic languages of antiquity to refer to an "owner" or "lord."
The name Beelzebul is derived from the Hebrew בַּעַל זְבוּב Baʿal-zəḇūḇ, from the second book of Kings. In the Hebrew Bible, the term Baʿal appears around 90 times in reference to various gods.
In the Japanese version, her personal name Makoto is written as 眞 by using kyuujitai (traditional character forms), rather than its new form 真.
Makoto shares her English, Chinese, and Japanese voice actors with the Raiden Shogun.

Notes[]

↑ In Radiant Sakura, Makoto confirms that her ideal is also eternity, that "Eternity extends time into infinity, dreams illuminate each moment within." Ei comments that Makoto's understanding of eternity is much more profound than her, leading to her "no longer pursuing an eternity defined by stasis." In Wishes in Chapter II: Act III - Omnipresence Over Mortals, Yae Miko points out that Makoto "in each moment cherished the beauty of what was before her."
