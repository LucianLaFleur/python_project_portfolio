 These medicinal herbs...
Media:VO Xuanfu 01.ogg "These medicinal herbs... I recall there should be some growing nearby."

Dialogue[]

Xuanfu: We're still a few herbal varieties short of completing Mr. Yiqing's order. It seems we'll have to send someone to Bubu Pharmacy to buy them...
 You are...
Xuanfu: I'm Xuanfu, a very ordinary herb gatherer.
Xuanfu: Feel free to let me know if you need any herbs. I'll do my best to get you some.
 Do you often gather herbs here?
Xuanfu: Indeed, I am quite familiar with the mountains around here, so feel free to ask if you cannot find your way.
Xuanfu: And I suggest staying away from Yaodie Valley unless you have a specific reason to go there. As far as I know, it is not welcoming to outsiders.
 About Yaodie Valley...
Xuanfu: Honestly, though, I don't know much about Yaodie Valley. I've only heard the village elders mention it.
Xuanfu: According to them, the valley is full of butterflies, and Herblord's abode is hidden deep within.
Xuanfu: Herblord is fond of peace and quiet, so I haven't attempted to explore the place, and don't know what it's like there.
 About Bubu Pharmacy...
Xuanfu: Bubu Pharmacy can be said to be the best infirmary in Liyue.
Xuanfu: Dr. Baizhu's skills are impeccable, his pharmacy is packed with rare herbs, and the young girl in charge of getting the herbs is extremely nimble.
Xuanfu: If I could attain just a tenth of their skill, I would have no regrets in this life.
 Goodbye.
Xuanfu: Be careful out there!
