Nabu Malikata,[5] the Goddess of Flowers, also known by various names such as the Lord of Joy and Happiness and the Mistress of Dreams, is a deceased god who was a close friend of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, the previous Dendro Archon of Sumeru.[8] The two were considered among the three God-Kings of Sumeru alongside King Deshret, and were friends who each pursued their own paths towards "wisdom."[9] She is the creator of the Jinn.
She may be a survivor of the original Seelie race.[10][11]

Appearance[]
According to legend, Nabu Malikata was said to have "beautiful" horns on her head. The horns of Nilou's crown in her default outfit, Neither Flower Nor Mist, were made in reflection of this trait.[12]
When the Traveler sees Nabu Malikata in Liloupar's memories, they describe her appearance as being "ineffably beautiful," comparable to "the totality of her Jinn." However, when the Traveler meets her gaze, they are faced with "nothingness."[7]

Story[]
Nabu Malikata, the Goddess of Flowers, lived during the time when the Second Who Came arrived from beyond the firmament and brought war to her kin, though she acknowledges that they "brought about illusions that could break through shackles to the land." She was later "cast aside by the heavens" along with the rest of her kin, who were punished for an unknown sin by becoming stripped of their minds and becoming husks of their former selves. Somehow, Nabu Malikata was able to maintain her original form. According to legend, she wandered the barren wastes for seventy-two days. Springs gushed from her wounds, becoming streams that flowed into gardens. Water lilies grew in these gardens, and the Jinn were born from them. The first jinn begged her to stay with them, and she relented. Purple flowers resembling the moon bloomed wherever she stopped, and they were called Padisarahs.[11]
Some time later, she met Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and King Deshret, who shared his throne with them, even though most of Teyvat's gods were warring against each other for power during the Archon War. They were known as the God-Kings of Sumeru and were good friends. Nabu Malikata and King Deshret built the ancient civilization of Ay-Khanoum in the desert as an earthly paradise.[3] The Goddess of Flowers was the originator and namesake of the Sabzeruz Festival (Chinese: 花神诞日 "Birthday of the Goddess of Flowers"), which originally commemorated Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's birthday.[12] After Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death, the Sabzeruz Festival became a celebration for her successor Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday.[13]
At some point in time, Nabu Malikata foresaw the coming of the cataclysm so she created a shard of Khvarena, whom she referred to as her daughter. This shard would eventually transform into the divine bird Simurgh. The divine bird would be destined to sacrifice itself during the cataclysm in order to save the Amrita that is being corrupted by the abyss. Nabu Malikata gave the shard to Rukkhadevata as she believed that Rukkhadevata's "light" is more radiant than hers.[14]
King Deshret was ambitious and rejected "the gift granted by the divine throne," wanting to seek his own path for his people. Nabu Malikata warned him not to seek forbidden knowledge, telling him not to seek the Master of the Four Shades and inquire the mysteries of the stars and abyss. She told him about the divine nails and the calamities they caused. However, King Deshret remained undeterred and told her about his own ambitions. Nabu Malikata admired his rebellious spirit and decided to assist him in seeking the hidden knowledge, all the while knowing that she would die.[11] Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was heartbroken by her fellow God-Kings' plans, so she shepherded her own people away to create an oasis in a corner of the desert, leaving Nabu Malikata to wait for a return that never came.[15][16]
According to legend, Nabu Malikata died "due to the malice of the burning sun and yellow sand."[3] While the actual cause of her death is currently unknown, it has been suggested that she had planned her death so that the bitterness of her death would preserve her legacy forever. King Deshret, who was enamored with her, never realized her intentions.[17]
The original Padisarah flower went extinct with her death,[3] and although Greater Lord Rukkhadevata attempted to recreate the flowers, she was unable to recreate its original shade of purple.
Following Nabu Malikata's death, King Deshret eventually descended into madness and was further deceived by his counsels.[18]

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
Nabu is an ancient Mesopotamian god of literacy, the rational arts, scribes, and wisdom. His name (Akkadian: 𒀭𒀝 Nabû) means "announcer" or "authorized person" and is a cognate with words in several other Semitic languages, such as Arabic نبي nabiyy and Hebrew נביא naví, meaning "enlightened" or "prophet."
Malikata may be derived from Arabic ملكة malika, "queen" or from the ideogram of the Middle Persian word for queen, MLKTA (Middle Persian: 𐭬𐭫𐭪𐭲𐭠 bāmbišn).
In the Eternal Oasis, her name is written as "NABU MLKTA" in Deshret Script, the same as the ideogram of the Middle Persian word.
