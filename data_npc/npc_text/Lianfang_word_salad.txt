 Tea-themed snacks...
Media:VO Lianfang 01.ogg "Tea eggs and teacakes! Refreshing refreshments!"

Dialogue[]

Lianfang: Tea eggs! Teacakes! Refreshing snacks! Welcome to Lianfang Dim Sum! Simple and convenient specialty foods that you can even enjoy onboard a ship!
 Let me take a look at the menu...
Lianfang: Choose anything you like!
(Opens shop menu)
 Why do you emphasize "simple and convenient"?
Lianfang: Oh... It's a long story...
Lianfang: Chenyu Vale has a leisurely and elegant atmosphere. We locals are used to sitting by the water, brewing a pot of tea with two saucers of beans and two main dishes between us...
Lianfang: We drink, and enjoy the view, and at the height of our enjoyment, we recite and compose poems! Ah, such freedom!
Lianfang: They say a gorgeous view compliments delicious food, and in such an environment, the tea in one's cup and the food on one's plate becomes exceptionally intoxicating.
Lianfang: Many traditional dishes in Chenyu Vale were prepared with that in mind.
Lianfang: But at the end of the day, Yilong Wharf is a commercial port, and foreign visitors wouldn't understand even if we told them.
Lianfang: The people coming and going through here are only focused on getting their work done quickly and making a killing, so they only need working meals that can be finished quickly.
Lianfang: I've made appropriate improvements to our traditional dishes to satisfy their needs.
Lianfang: Once they fall for our local cuisine, I'll guide them toward calming down and enjoying a proper meal in an appropriate environment...
Lianfang: In this way, we can adapt to the trend of commercialization while promoting our traditional cuisine!
 You won't get seasick eating onboard?
Lianfang: That's exactly it!
Lianfang: Cheff Baatjan has improved our cuisine by adding a variety of supplemental ingredients while maintaining the dishes' original taste...
Lianfang: These supplemental ingredients greatly alleviate the symptoms of seasickness experienced by our diners, so they naturally feel better!
Lianfang: Some repeat customers even pay us a special visit before boarding to purchase some refreshments. They say that even the worst winds an waves are nothing to fear while they have our victuals in hand. It's great, right?
 Come again next time...
Lianfang: We look forward to serving you again!
