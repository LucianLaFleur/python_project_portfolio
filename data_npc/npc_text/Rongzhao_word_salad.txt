Rongzhao is Yelan's ancestor and Boyang's brother. The two fought against the monsters that poured out of The Chasm during the cataclysm, alongside the Millelith and later joined by the rogue yaksha Bosacius, who had long gone insane. During the battle, they discovered a mysterious underground palace with the uncanny ability to weaken the power of the Abyss. A number of Millelith, as well as Boyang and Bosacius, decided to lure the Abyssal monsters into this space and seal themselves within; Rongzhao was among the group which sealed the domain from outside. Despite surviving the battle, Rongzhao lost his sanity, which Xiao and Yelan attribute to the effect of Bosacius' karma; since Rongzhao did not have a Vision, he would not have been able to resist karma's effects for very long.[1] After the battle in the Chasm, Rongzhao's insanity would only be eased whenever he passed by Wangshu Inn, where Xiao dwells.[2]
