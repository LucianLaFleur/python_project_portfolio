Profile[]
Her father is Jacques and mother is Coralie. Jacques was a Sinthe seller before Callas made contact with him, causing Jacques to regret selling the beverage and began to betray his superiors. His superiors tasked him with killing Callas, but Jacques could not bring himself to do so, so they hired a third-party assassin to finish the job. Jacques was killed during a banquet with Callas by the assassin, but the assassin was not successful in killing Callas.
After Jacques' death, Coralie and Adele were taken to Poisson and cared for by the Spina di Rosula. At the time, Adele found the group scary and thus minimized interactions with them. Throughout the events of the Fontaine Archon Quests, Adele begins to realize that they were more welcoming than she perceived and began to look at Navia as a good figure. She even asks her to join the organization, but in part due to her young age, Navia does not do so. However, taking note of her enthusiasm for joining, Navia decides to have an official suit made for Adele, which she gives her as a gift and indicator that once she becomes of age, she would be welcome to join. When Colter tries to assassinate her and claims that she brought disgrace to the organization, Adele defends her, stating that she and her mother like her for what she does for the people. She and her mother later attend an unveiling of the design that Florent was planning for the statue when he shows it to Navia.
