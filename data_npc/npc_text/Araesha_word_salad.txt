Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

Araesha: More delicious riddles are needed, before Festival Utsava. Still not enough...
 Something on your mind?
Araesha: Ah, Nara friend.
Araesha: Nara friend knows not about Festival Utsava, thus knows not about Araesha's worries.
Araesha: When Festival Utsava starts, every Aranara returns to Vanarana, and many of them come to Araesha for riddles...
Araesha: But Araesha doesn't have enough riddles for everyone to eat...
 About riddles...
Araesha: Seeing Aranara failing to solve the riddles, Araesha feels happy.
Araesha: If Aranara solves the riddles, Araesha feels happy.
Araesha: All in all, riddles make Aranara happy.
Araesha: But Araesha has never provided a riddle for Nara. Araesha should think again, what happy riddles will Nara like?
 See you...
Araesha: Goodbye, Nara friend. Don't miss the feast of riddles.

Dialogue Set #2[]

Araesha: Nara solved all Araesha's riddles. Nara riddles must be fresh, too.
 What's on your mind?
Araesha: Ah, smart Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Araesha: At Festival Utsava, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) solved every delicious riddle of Araesha.
Araesha: Araesha doesn't have enough riddles.
Araesha: Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Nara riddles must be very fresh, no?
 Yes, very delicious.
Araesha: Araesha knew it. Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) ate many fresh riddles thus ate up all Araesha's riddles.
Araesha: Araesha wants a riddle match with little Nara.
 No, they taste bad.
Araesha: Is that so... Guess it's because Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) is smart.
Araesha: That's why Araesha's riddles are eaten up...
 Goodbye.
Araesha: Bye, smart Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
