Despite serving as Yusupov's subordinate, Theofan coveted Yusupov's position for himself. When Zhiyi, whom Yusupov saw as a mere pawn for getting a Fatui collaborator within the Liyue Qixing's ranks, sought to shake off the Fatui's control over him by assassinating Yusupov and then covering up any evidence of their collaboration, Theofan assisted by providing Zhiyi with extra poison to use on his superior.
Zhiyi and Yusupov's plots were foiled by Yelan and the Traveler. Yelan attempted to use the information she gathered to get Theofan in her clutches and use him against the Fatui, but by the time she attempted to apprehend him, she discovered that the Harbinger "Regrator" Pantalone had already recalled Theofan to safety.[1]
