Profile[]
Little is currently known about Pulcinella beyond his rank and title. Unlike several other Harbingers who were hand-picked for the position by Pierro, Tartaglia was instead inducted into the Fatui by Pulcinella and worked his way up into the Harbingers.

Appearance[]
Pulcinella is a white-haired elderly man with white mustache and rounded glasses along with pointy nose and ears. He wears a dark blue longcoat with flared and feathered sleeves over at least a pair of baggy blue trousers and long flared shoes. His coat has a wide feathered collar with some form of hat or headdress with a pair of feathers. He is surrounded by ice, but it is unknown if this implies the possession of a Cryo Vision or Delusion, or serves as just a visual shorthand for Snezhnaya.

Story[]
When Tartaglia (then known as Ajax) was 14 years old, he was drawn into the Abyss and re-emerged greatly changed by the events that transpired there, gaining unmatched combat prowess and an uncanny habit of having chaos follow in his wake. Following several incidents in Tartaglia's hometown village of Morepesok, his worried father brought him to the Fatui in hopes that they could hone his temperament, only to watch as his son easily beat up well-trained soldiers. Tartaglia's unique attributes piqued Pulcinella's curiosity, and he conscripted the boy into the Fatui under the guise of serving the Tsaritsa as punishment.[5]

Present Day[]
An indeterminate amount of time ago, Signora made an agreement with the Liyue Qixing and dispatched the Ninth Company, which includes some of Pulcinella's men, on an expedition to The Chasm to explore its depths. Due to the amount of distance between The Chasm and the surface, their supply line with the Fatui stationed in Liyue Harbor was the Ninth Company's only way of getting both supplies and information about the surface.[7][8]
However, following Tartaglia's actions in Liyue and the revival of Osial, relations between the Liyue Qixing and the Fatui soured greatly. The Qixing pulled their support from the expedition and forbade the Millelith from even making contact with the Fatui. With the supply line cut off, the Ninth Company was stranded without even the knowledge of what had occurred. By the time the Traveler finds them, the Ninth Company's original sixty-four members had been reduced to half its number, was divided into multiple groups, and no longer had a chain of command. Anton, a direct subordinate of Pulcinella's, bemoans that "dispens[ing] with less valuable assets" to achieve a greater goal is the Harbinger's modus operandi.[7]
In A Winter Night's Lazzo, Pulcinella attends La Signora's funeral and orders all work to be halted for half a day to mourn her passing. The brevity of this mourning period draws criticism from Pantalone and Arlecchino.
Following Signora's death, Viktor fell under Pulcinella's command. Pulcinella immediately reassigned Viktor to Sumeru City to assist Vsevolod in coordinating the logistics regarding the newly opening Northland Bank branch.[9]
After Arlecchino returned with the Hydro Gnosis, Pulcinella would work with Pantalone in something called "Project Stuzha" with him, using the House of the Hearth as the "key" player. Both Arlecchino and Lyney suspect that the project and the sudden thrust of their organization into the spotlight meant that he was trying to rein in their influence.[10]

He is an acceptable mayor, I suppose... perhaps even an exceptional one. He has an uncanny ability to make great gains at a small price, which has earned him substantial acclaim throughout his political circles. However "small" the price may be, if it continues to come at the expense of my organization, sooner or later... Hmph.TartagliaAbout The Rooster Media:VO_Tartaglia About The Rooster.ogg Media:VO ZH_Tartaglia About The Rooster.ogg Media:VO JA_Tartaglia About The Rooster.ogg Media:VO KO_Tartaglia About The Rooster.ogg I don't know what his motivations could be, but he seems genuine about wanting to help me. He treats me just like family. Oh, and speaking of family — Tonia and Teucer are always telling me about the pastries and other gifts he brings them when they write. So while I've been away from Snezhnaya, he's kept his promise to take care of my family.WandererAbout The Rooster Media:VO_Wanderer About The Rooster.ogg Media:VO ZH_Wanderer About The Rooster.ogg Media:VO JA_Wanderer About The Rooster.ogg Media:VO KO_Wanderer About The Rooster.ogg Only someone as dense as Childe would think The Rooster is looking after him and his family out of the goodness of his heart. Although the mayor has indeed done a number of things for their benefit, anyone with a brain would be able to tell that the underlying meaning is "your entire family is in my hands."
Trivia[]
Etymology[]
Like the titles of all Fatui Harbingers, Pulcinella is a stock character in commedia dell'arte, an early form of professional theatre originating from Italy. The name Pulcinella is derived from, or a combination of, either pollastrello (meaning "rooster") or pulcino (meaning "chick").[11]
The stock character is typically depicted as a top-heavy, chicken shaped man who wears a mask with an exaggerated nose.
Pulcinella as a Commedia stock character was known for being melodramatic, and often having unexplainable fits of rage in which he would take out his anger and frustration on others.
