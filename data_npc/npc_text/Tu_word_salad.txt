Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before starting Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering)
Tu: Well, well, look at you, staring agape this way and that. First time here at The Chasm? Want the mining superstar, Brother Tu himself, to show you around?
 Brother Tu?
Tu: That's right, and that's me. I've been here a long time, and I'm a pretty strong guy, so I'm loved and respected by all, to be sure!
 Mining superstar?
Tu: That's right! It's a nickname everyone gave me. A sign of affection, I'm sure. I mean, I did dig up ten tons of ore in one day that one time!
Tu: From then on, everyone started calling me the mining superstar.
Tu: It's just a shame that The Chasm's been sealed up. If not, the others would all be around for you to ask. Trust me, they'll all know who I am.
 Pretty impressive!
Tu: Haha! Tell you what, when The Chasm opens up someday, let's go mining together. I'll guide you along!
 See you.
Tu: See you. Don't forget what I told you!

Dialogue Set #2[]

(After starting Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering)
Tu: Anyway, allow me to let you in on a secret.
Tu: Rex Lapis is actually still alive. Not only that, he'll definitely come to settle this whole mess here in The Chasm.
 !?
Tu: Hehe, stunning news, eh? Lemme tell you something: his Exuvia has actually transformed into some blond-haired [sic] young (‍manmanText for male Traveler/womanwomanText for female Traveler‍)!
Tu: And with another part of his adeptal powers, he turned into some sort of adeptal fruit that can get angry and even sneeze. They're still going around Liyue resolving all manner of calamities, even today, protecting us all.
 A blond-haired [sic] young (‍manmanText for Aether/womanwomanText for Lumine‍)...?
Tu: Ooh, interested, are we? Then let me tell you something else, something that I've only told a couple of people. You know the Traveler named (Traveler) who's been active all over the world lately? This person's actually Rex Lapis himself!
Tu: Huh... You're not surprised? Hang on a moment... blond [sic] hair, and a talking adeptal fruit...
Tu: Wait, are you that Traveler?
 That's right, that's me, and here's my adeptal fruit Paimon.
Tu: Ah, so that rumor about the Traveler was true! And here I thought that Muning was just boasting...
Tu: Well, looks like there's hope for the situation in The Chasm now...
 Adeptal fruit...?
Tu: That's right, they say that this adeptal fruit was created from the very essence of the adeptal energies of heaven and earth themselves. If a mortal were to eat it, they would be granted great longevity, and power enough to fell a bull in a single punch!
Tu: Of course, I don't know if that's true or not, but I'd sure like to have a bite and see what it tastes like.
 Who told you that?
Tu: I... I figured it out myself. I mean, I've been here so long and I don't have any other hobbies, so what I do is put the various things I hear together.
Tu: You see, Rex Lapis' passing and the appearance of that Traveler followed closely after each other.
Tu: And so I thought, could this just be another one of the Lord of Geo's incognito travels?
Tu: I'm not intending to grab here, but I reckon that this is a most rational explanation, by yours truly no less!
 See you.
Tu: Eh? You're not interested? Come on, I wasn't bragging or anything, y'know?

Dialogue Set #3[]

(After completing The Chasm Delvers)
Tu: If this place does indeed become a market, then we should establish connections with the Feiyun Commerce Guild as soon as possible.
 Market?
Tu: That's right, I've heard people say that The Chasm is about to be bought over by the Yanshang Teahouse and turned into a grand market.
Tu: I'm not overstating things, either. A couple of days earlier, I came across some people from Yanshang Teahouse who'd come looking for Muning the manager.
Tu: So, just by chance, I heard them discussing some kind of monetary transaction.
Tu: How did it go again...? Let me think.
Tu: "Thanks to the second young master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, I was able to raise this sum of Mora. And I would also like to thank you representatives of the Yanshang Teahouse for making a trip down to this quiet spot specifically."
Tu: I mean, just listen to that. They must mean that Muning's been in contact with Yanshang Teahouse to liven this place up in collaboration with the Feiyun Commerce Guild, am I right?
 I don't think that's how things are.
Tu: Oh, come on. These business discussions aren't what they seem on the surface. Much thought is needed to decipher their plots and plans!
Tu: I'll ponder this a while longer. I won't let this opportunity slip by.
 Why are you asking me?
Tu: Well, that's because you've contributed so much to resolving the situation down below! I'm sure they'll tell you everything.
Tu: If even you've never heard a peep about this, then surely there is some super-secret plan at play. That means that it's all the more imperative that I do not miss a thing!
 Feiyun Commerce Guild?
Tu: Exactly! I've heard that they usually deal in silks and satins, but I didn't expect them to also want in on that Chasm Mora as well.
Tu: Also, I never expected Muning to have monetary connections to the Feiyun Commerce Guild. This is a great opportunity!
Tu: So, uh... could you tell me a bit about the details behind their development plans?
 See you around.
Tu: Oh... Alright then, I'll ponder this a bit longer.
