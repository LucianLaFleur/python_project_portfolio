Profile[]
An eccentric researcher from the Akademiya, Drusus enjoys writing riddles and putting them around Sumeru City for people to discover. The Traveler and Paimon stumble across one of his riddles, and they travel through the whole city solving it before finally meeting him to receive their reward. They later help him create a new series of riddles, providing ideas for where to place the clues and what to write.
He may be the mentor mentioned by the Treasure Hoarder Narzam, who also enjoys riddles and brain teasers. He mentions her at the end of Treasure of Wisdom: A New Plan and wonders if she is causing trouble.
