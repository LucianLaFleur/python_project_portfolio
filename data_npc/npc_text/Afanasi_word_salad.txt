Media:VO Afanasi All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Afanasi: (Do these inspectors who come around every day think I'm with the Fatui? I'm really not!)

Dialogue[]

Afanasi: An inspection today, and tomorrow too... Why is there one every day?
 Are you alright?
Afanasi: Me? I'm okay. I'm holding up.
Afanasi: I don't know why, but the port inspectors have been checking my goods every day.
Afanasi: What I'm selling is clearly ordinary Snezhnayan industrial goods though.
Afanasi: But these inspectors seem to be always on edge, as if they are afraid of my wares exploding all of a sudden.
Afanasi: Ah, I wish they would relax. These constant investigations will affect my business...
 See you.
Afanasi: When will they leave me alone...?
