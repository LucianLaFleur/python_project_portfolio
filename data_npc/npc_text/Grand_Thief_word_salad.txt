Profile[]
The Grand Thief's real name is unknown, but it is said that he originates from Fontaine.
He was known to be quite popular amongst Treasure Hoarders. It is said that sometime after Osial was defeated, a group of Treasure Hoarders banded together to distract the Abyss Order while sending a single thief, The Grand Thief, to infiltrate and steal any valuables. The statue and the Grand Thief's kneeling corpse would later be discovered by the Traveler and Paimon.[1] The Grand Thief can be seen kneeling before the Defiled Statue, deceased due to unknown causes.[Note 1]

Appearance[]
The Grand Thief resembles Li Ding although with a lighter hair color.

Trivia[]
The Grand Thief might be an allusion to Arsène Lupin.
If the Grand Thief is viewed at from a very specific angle, he can be seen blinking. It is unknown as to if this is an oversight or a deliberate decision.
Notes[]

↑ It is heavily implied that the Grand Thief did not die from external injuries, despite their proximity to the Abyss Herald. Therefore, it may only be presumed that they died to overexposure to Abyssal Energy surrounding the area, or alternatively some other force of nature (such as the Sinner, which may explain why the Grand Thief was in a worshiping position, given that the Defiled Statue was tainted by Chlothar Alberich)
