Appearance[]
Koyama wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the ashigaru (Japanese: 足軽) of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient shitagi with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray kobakama, and waraji sandals without the socks. Although not visible, the Sangonomiya Clan's crest is imprinted on the back of the shitagi, below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with sode (shoulder armor), han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it. Koyama is equipped with a juumonji yari, whose shaft is colored with a red-white gradient and has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest under the spearhead.

Dialogue[]

Koyama: That bridge over there seems way too high up. Will it really be okay...
 What's the matter?
Koyama: The matter with me? Uh... I'm fine right now, actually. I mean, I haven't crossed that bridge yet!
Koyama: Ah, stable ground is the best ground after all...
 Are you afraid of heights, by any chance?
Koyama: Um, heh, so you realized...
Koyama: I'm a Sangonomiya soldier, and in the past, my work always had to do with normal patrols and other duties, so I was fine.
Koyama: But as we started dispatching more troops out, I ended up having to guard this road to Sangonomiya Shrine.
Koyama: I couldn't muster up the courage to say that I was afraid of heights, so I just came here anyway. I thought I could take it...
Koyama: But when I got here... I mean, just look at that! It's so high up! I... I can't even take a step further, never mind guard this place!
Koyama: Oh, if only work was as simple as before... I just had to tail outsiders and stuff, you know?
 Tail?
Koyama: Ah? Uh, well, that was some time ago.
Koyama: Someone from the Tenryou Commission came here, but instead of looking for Her Excellency or General Gorou, he went walking around the island instead.
Koyama: Her Excellency couldn't figure out what he wanted, so she sent a few of us to follow him, in case he tried anything untoward.
Koyama: Turns out that he didn't really do any investigating at all. He just happened to be on a stroll in his uniform.
Koyama: He even called himself a detective or something. Are all detectives as weird as him?
 Seeya.
Koyama: See you. Just, ah, remember to be careful walking up there, alright?
