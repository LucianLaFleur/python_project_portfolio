Dialogue[]

Sara: Welcome to Good Hunter. How can I help you?
 Can I get food to-go?
Sara: Certainly. Here's the menu.
(Opens Good Hunter wares)
 About Stormterror...
(Before completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
Sara: *sigh* Business has really taken a turn for the worse ever since Stormterror appeared. Nobody's in the mood to eat.
Sara: Even those customers who do show up do nothing but sigh and moan...
Sara: But I suppose that's normal. I just hope that all this will be over soon.
 I'd like to ask about something.
Sara: Oh? What can I do for you?
 What is Good Hunter?
Sara: Good Hunter is the best restaurant in town. We are famous for our Venison Steak and Satisfying Salad.
Sara: The hunters in Springvale provide us with the ingredients.
Sara: All ingredients are brought in fresh every day.
Sara: I can tell you about any item on the menu if you're interested.
 Tell me about Mondstadt.
Sara: Judging by your looks, you must be a traveler.
Sara: Mondstadt truly is a great place for visitors.
Sara: Its temperate climate and clean water give birth to the best apples in all of Teyvat.
Sara: Our famous Satisfying Salad has Mondstadt apples in it. Do you want to give it a try?
 Tell me, are there any events happening as of late?
Sara: There happens to be a salad tasting event ongoing now.
Sara: Here you go. If you like it, you can always visit me again.
(Obtain  Satisfying Salad ×4)
 Sorry for bothering you.
Sara: Thank you for coming to Good Hunter. Do come back next time!

Trivia[]
She decided she wanted to import Jueyun Chili peppers from Liyue for local resale. However, Vile thinks this would not be a sound business decision, as the peppers are supposedly extremely hot and "86%" of locals wouldn't want them. Vile is considering sending Kaeya to talk to Sara after having failed to convince her otherwise herself.
