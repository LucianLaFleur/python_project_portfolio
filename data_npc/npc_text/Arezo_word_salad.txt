Dialogue[]

Arezo: I don't think I've ever seen you around here... Are you a new guest here?
 Who are you?
Arezo: Oh me? I'm Arezo, and I'm... a former researcher in the Akademiya.
Arezo: My younger brother Hosseini and I both got in the Akademiya, but I just couldn't get used to that kind of life...
Arezo: My younger brother seems to like it though, so he can do as he likes.
Arezo: Anyway, I gave up the life of a researcher and returned to this place, my hometown, to lead a life of comfort without any papers or report meetings!
 To be honest, I'm a little jealous.
Arezo: Jealousy won't make you any happier. If you have a dream, take actions and go for it.
Arezo: But it seems that you are in a hurry. I guess you're busy with something else, aren't you?
Arezo: It's okay. It rains and shines just as flowers bloom and fade. It's never too late to take a break once you've done what you have to do.
(Obtain  Nilotpala Lotus ×4)
 See you.
Arezo: Alright, I hope you enjoy your stay here!
