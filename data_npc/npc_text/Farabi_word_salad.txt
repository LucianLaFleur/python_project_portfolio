Event Dialogue[]
Of Ballads and Brews[]
Springvale[]

Farabi: The Snowboar that has been extinct for over a hundred years has reappeared, and they've left their original cold habitat in Dragonspine to live in warmer forests...
Farabi: This is intriguing. Has something changed in the ecology of Teyvat recently? Hmm, I must study this closely.
Farabi: I've been to Mondstadt before, but only to drown my sorrows. Thanks to your help, I'm back on my feet!
Farabi: I will do what I can to speed my investigations up while you guys look for traces of Snowboars.

Dawn Winery[]

Farabi: Hmmm... Something's bothering me. Does such a creature really exist?
Farabi: Sorry, I was just thinking about something. Mr. Edmund told me today that he once found huge animal prints at the base of Dragonspine.
Farabi: Based on the descriptions, they seem like the prints of a Snowboar. But can there really be a Snowboar that big?
Farabi: Once we determine the route the Snowboars took, the next stage would be to go to Dragonspine to investigate their survival out in the wild. Let's keep an eye out for the huge prints then as well.
