 A smaller boat...

Dialogue[]

(Talk to Verut or Aurele)
Verut: Big brother, this place is kinda narrow. We can't race like this...
Aurele: It's fine. The adults say that boats can sail wherever there's water. Why don't we make small boats? You know, like the aquabuses!
Verut: Ooh, nice! And then we can race using those boats, can't we?
Aurele: Good idea. Now, as for the materials... Should we go ask Mr. Hugues?
Verut: Must we? Every time we ask him to fix a toy, he'll deliver something completely different back to us.
Aurele: But isn't that a good thing? If he can turn a boat into an aircraft, I'd even workn for him, really!
