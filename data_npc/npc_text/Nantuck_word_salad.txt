 The pitch-black whale...
Media:VO Nantuck 01.ogg "The pitch-black whale inhabiting the outer sea depths... Ah, what an excellent specimen."

Dialogue[]

Nantuck: A great black whale in the open seas... Yes, this will surely be a bestseller!
 I'd like to buy some fishing supplies.
(After completing Exploding Population)
Nantuck: Well, I've got some of the Association's stock right here. Have a look and see if any of them meet your needs.
(Opens the Mondstadt Fishing Association shop menu)
 Who are you?
Nantuck: My name is Nantuck, one of the people in charge of the Mondstadt Fishing Association.
Nantuck: Huh, from the looks of you, you appear to have recognized me for my other role. Ah, so this is the frightening power of fame, eh?
Nantuck: Well then, there's no point pretending. That's right! The famed sea-life author Nantuck — that's me!
Nantuck: ...Eh? You've never read anything I've ever written? Well, that's because I haven't published anything yet. But fret not! A great work by yours truly will soon sweep across the literary markets, that much I can guarantee.
Nantuck: And if you'd like, I'd happily put you first in line when my first signing session comes up.
 What do you mean by "a giant black whale"?
Nantuck: Shh! Softer, please! This is my magnum opus in progress we're talking about here!
Nantuck: Well, since you seem interested, allow me to give you a sneak peek.
Nantuck: Imagine this: an epic tale on the high seas, with a heroic fisherman pursuing a giant black whale! This'll be a bestseller for sure!
Nantuck: But don't you breathe a word of this to anyone, you hear?
Nantuck: Such glorious inspiration cannot be reclaimed, should they be lost to someone else.
 Goodbye.
Nantuck: See you. Haha, this idea will be popular, I'm sure of it!

Trivia[]
Nantuck may be named after Nantucket, an island township in Massachusetts, USA. The island is a historical whaling hub and a setting of the classic American novel Moby-Dick.
Similarly, his "pitch-black whale" appears to parody the "great white whale" that Moby-Dick is named after.
