Dialogue[]

Albert: Sorry! I was just leaving...
Albert: Oh, you're not a sister. Can I help?
 About Stormterror...
(After completing A Long Shot)
Albert: Stormterror must have been moved by Barbara-sama's charisma, which returned it to its senses at last!
Albert: Barbara-sama's smile is like the dawn that breaks through the darkness. It is the star flashing through the night sky. Even Stormterror cannot withstand her loveliness!
Albert: If you cannot understand that, then you're part of the problem. You are not yet sufficiently enlightened!
Albert: Yes, this must be the truth! Go Barbara, Go!
 Did you just say "Barbara-sama"?
Albert: Yes. Is there something you find strange about that?
Albert: Barbara-sama lights up my world. She is so adorable, so kind, so pure and innocent...
Albert: ...What's that look for? You think I'm making this up?
Albert: You, (‍sirsirText for male Traveler/ma'amma'amText for female Traveler‍), need to be baptized in the spirit!
Albert: ...By which I mean, you need to witness one of Barbara-sama's live performances!
Albert: Do you hear me? You must go and watch her performance! *sigh* You ignorant fool... You wouldn't recognize the grace of the gods if it slapped you in the face!
 What are you doing?
Albert: Nothing, just out for a stroll.
Albert: Because this is the closest I can get to Barbara-sama without disrupting her work at the Cathedral!
Albert: Can you smell the scent of honey in the air?
Albert: ...Um, do you want to join the Barbara Fan Club?
Albert: 'Cause if you do, you're in luck — I actually run it! Whether you want to show your support through fan activities or get up-to-date info on performance arrangements, once you're a member you can always find someone to point you in the right direction.
Albert: What do you reckon? Give it some thought!
 Goodbye.
Albert: "Go Barbara, Go!"
Albert: Oh, you're still here? I wasn't being a weirdo, I was just practicing the chant we do at performances.

Event Dialogue[]
Invitation of Windblume[]

Albert: I hope Barbara-sama will like what we've prepared...
Albert: ...*sigh* Traveler, what kind of gift do you think moves people the most?
 Flowers?
Albert: Flowers... a—as a matter of fact... we at the Barbara Fan Club already have a similar idea.
Albert: Sending flowers the old-fashioned way would be too boring, better to come up with something a little more... unique...
 A letter?
Albert: Not a bad choice, but if it's just an ordinary letter then it'll be forgotten in no time...
Albert: Hmm, the content has to be different from a normal letter, we need something unforgettable...
 I'm afraid I don't know either...
Albert: Hmm... I wonder how Barbara-sama will react when she sees our gift...

Windblume's Breath[]

Albert: ...*sigh* Traveler, what kind of gift do you think moves people the most?
Albert: Windblumes... I'm sure Barbara-sama has already seen plenty of those and won't be interested at all.
Albert: A letter... I think Barbara-sama gets plenty of those as well, and the feedback from her fans is virtually the same.
Albert: I need to get her something more unique, something more eye-catching...
Albert: Huh, you mean we need to be careful not to cause any trouble for Barbara-sama? Ah, right, thanks for the reminder. That's really important too.
Albert: Barbara-sama's work is essential. As fans, we should do our utmost not to disturb her!
