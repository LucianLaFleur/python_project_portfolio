Matsuura is the leader of the Matsuura Clan, one of the subordinate clans of the Kanjou Commission.
Notably power hungry, Matsuura concocted a plan for a power grab in the Kanjou Commission through the use of pushing Hiiragi Chisato and Kujou Kamaji into an arranged marriage, leaving the Hiiragi Clan leaderless and allowing him to take power for himself. To accomplish this, he spreads a false rumor regarding this arranged marriage.
Knowing that a guard named Shinnojou, who had feelings for Chisato, would likely interfere with his plans, he sends various informants to spy on the clan and kidnap Shinnoujou, who is subsequently freed by Kamisato Ayato and the Traveler. Claiming that Ayato and his subordinates had attacked his men without explanation, Matsuura proceeds to attack and antagonize Ayato; Ayato is unimpressed with Matsuura's actions, believing him to be more intelligent than he actually was and requests him to await for his response.
It is after this incident that Matsuura becomes paranoid about an invasion of Tenryou Commission officers in Ritou, causing a deadlock; now "fearing the worst", he sends out a number of informants to gather information. One of his informants, Hideo, finds out about what is going on in Ritou and rushes back to tell Matsuura. Two days later, Matsuura walks in on a conversation between Chisato and the Traveler. Matsuura immediately assumes that the Traveler is attempting to take Chisato away and attempts to sway her opinions; this infuriates Chisato, who castigates Matsuura and lectures him severely on the ramifications of his actions. She then requests him discuss with his subordinates on his next course of action.
Ashamed and defeated, Matsuura calls his actions "radical and duplicitous", pleading with the Traveler for forgiveness; on being informed that the person that they should be talking to instead is Ayato, he requests the Traveler and Chisato follow him to speak with Ayato and for them to give Ayato favorable remarks about him. Begging Ayato profusely for mercy, Ayato ultimately waves him off, telling Matsuura that this outcome was going to happen no matter what, before asking about his next steps and dismissing him. After walking out of the Yashiro Commission headquarters, Matsuura is not seen or heard again and is presumably punished by the Electro Archon for his actions.
