Dialogue[]

Layth: The climate of the rainforest has been so unkind to me...
 What is it?
Layth: My old wound often aches in humid weather, so it pretty much hurts all the time in Sumeru City.
Layth: Also, because of it, I can only do simple work in town.
Layth: It's truly a dilemma...
 See you.
Layth: Someone come tell me when to retire...
