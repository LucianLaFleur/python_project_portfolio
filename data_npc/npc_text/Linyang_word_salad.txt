Dialogue[]
Path of Stalwart Stone[]

Linyang: Hello, Traveler. Do you have anything to ask me?
(If there are remaining Moonchase Charms or Mystmoon Chests)
 So about the Moonchase Charms and treasure chests in Liyue...
(Getting daily hints for the first time)
Linyang: Uh... Let me have a look...
Linyang: The placement of treasure chests and Moonchase Charms in Liyue should be handled by Tiantian... Oh well, let me mark some of them out for you.
Linyang: Let's just hope that she made those placements as she should've...
(If there are marked locations that have yet to be collected)
Linyang: I've already marked some of them out for you. Go have a look at your map first.
(If all the marked locations have been collected)
Linyang: Eh? You... you seem to have found all the treasure chests and Moonchase Charms that I marked out for you.
Linyang: Not bad, Traveler. Not bad at all.
Linyang: Still, I can't tell you about the locations of anymore chests or charms today. These are the rules, so please understand...
 Goodbye.
Linyang: See you. Enjoy the Moonchase Festival!

Path of Gentle Breezes[]

Linyang: Hello, Traveler. Do you have anything to ask me?
(If there are remaining Moonchase Charms or Mystmoon Chests)
 So about the Moonchase Charms and treasure chests in Mondstadt...
(Getting daily hints for the first time)
Linyang: Huh, so that's what you wanted to ask me about. Let me have a look, and I'll mark some of them out on the map for you...
Linyang: Still, I can't help you mark everything out. Guild rules, you know...?
Linyang: Also, I'm pretty sure Mondstadt is supposed to be under Cyrus's jurisdiction. Seriously, that guy...
Linyang: Well, I've marked them out. Have a look.
(If there are marked locations that have yet to be collected)
Linyang: I've already marked some of them out for you. Go have a look at your map first.
(If all the marked locations have been collected)
Linyang: Eh? You... you seem to have found all the treasure chests and Moonchase Charms that I marked out for you.
Linyang: Not bad, Traveler. Not bad at all.

Path of Austere Frost[]

Linyang: Hello, Traveler. Do you have anything to ask me?
(If there are remaining Moonchase Charms or Mystmoon Chests)
 So about the Moonchase Charms and treasure chests on Dragonspine...
(Getting daily hints for the first time)
Linyang: Oh, on Dragonspine, you say... Give me a moment...
Linyang: I remember that someone named Iris was in charge of placing items in the Dragonspine area... She really is very impressive...
Linyang: There, I've marked some of the locations out for you. Take a look at your map.
(If there are marked locations that have yet to be collected)
Linyang: I've already marked some of them out for you. Go have a look at your map first.
