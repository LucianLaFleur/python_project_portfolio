Dialogue[]

Manie: Hello traveler. Would you care for some freshly picked Jueyun Chilis?
 Jueyun chili [sic]?
Manie: Yes, they're grown exclusively in Jueyun Karst — hence the name.
Manie: A—a—achoo!
 Is it very spicy?
Manie: I've been asked this question by lots of people.
Manie: The way I see it, the proof is in the pudding!
Manie: If you do want to give it a go, go whip up a meal using it and try it for yourself.
(Obtain  Jueyun Chili ×5)
 A—achoo!
Manie: Haha, a little spicier than you're used to, right?
Manie: All the top chefs in Liyue love them — they're spicy, but refreshing, and don't have any of the usual side effects.
Manie: I'll pick up some black pepper and fowl when I get back, then I can make Jueyun Chili Chicken for the kids.
 What's Jueyun Chili Chicken?
Manie: Cooked Fowl, left to cool, then seasoned with Black Pepper and Jueyun Chilis. Easy to whip up and delicious to eat.
Manie: The Jueyun Chili is what really makes the dish. Without it, Jueyun Chili Chicken doesn't really taste of anything.
 Goodbye.
Manie: You sure you don't want any?
