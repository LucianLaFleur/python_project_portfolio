Furuyama is a human who lived 500 years ago during the time of the cataclysm. He was a member of the Raiden Shogun's retinue, and was quite close to Makoto, often serving her tea. At some point, he became blind.
When the cataclysm struck Inazuma, Furuyama, having grown to Makoto's teachings, met his end in Araumi as others fled, since he was content with his life and had no regrets. 500 years afterwards, his memories would roam the Sacred Sakura's roots, where he manifested after Ei and the Traveler were tracking down rifthounds that were damaging the Sacred Sakura's roots. He was pleased to see the Shogun again and tried to serve them tea, only to notice that his tea set was missing. The Traveler and Ei offered to get him one, doing so from the Kamisato Estate, but by the time they had returned, he had disappeared as the Ley Lines could no longer sustain him. Ei brewed a set of tea and left a cup behind in Furuyama's memory.
