Dialogue[]

Nagaoka Hidemitsu: Ugh, how worrisome... What should I do next?
 Been busy with anything lately?
(After completing Omnipresence Over Mortals and The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna‍[verification needed])
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: Lately, you say... Well, I have been thinking about land management of late.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: I'm not sure if you've noticed, but there is an island to our south known as Tsurumi Island that has been locked off by perpetual fog, the point where few people dare enter.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: For some unknown reason, the fog has cleared recently, so I and my colleagues are presently discussing if we should put a team together to survey the area.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: If we could undertake some development there, it would be quite the contribution to Inazuma...
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: However, the situation isn't all that clear yet, so it may be some time yet before we come to a conclusion.
 What's got you so worried?
(Before completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: As a civil officer of the Shogunate, what else could I be worried about?
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: I've already requested the Tri-Commission to handle the matter. Although I am the head of the civil office, I don't have any actual power. All I can do is worry all day.
 About the Tri-Commission...
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: As an outsider, what do you think of each of the Commissions?
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: ...Forget it, what's the point in asking you such a question? But in light of the situation, let me speak with you frankly.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: The Kanjou Commission strictly enforces the Sakoku Decree, even Ritou is sealed off from the outside world. But I'm afraid this policy is only making matters worse for Inazuma.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: The Tenryou Commission aggressively uses their military might. When faced with the issue of the Sangonomiya rebels, they decided to suppress it solely with brute force. They ignore the hearts of the people, and someday will pay the price for that.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: As for the Yashiro Commission... They do indeed empathize with the people in their handling of ceremonial affairs, but without any military or financial power they are relatively weak.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: Distributing aid during wartime can provide temporary relief to address the problem, but it is no long-term solution. It is gradually consuming the strength of the Kamisato Clan.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: Ugh... Just talking about it makes me more worried.
 What are you fretting about?
(After completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: As a civil officer of the Shogunate, what else could I be worried about?
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: Inazuma's gone through so many changes recently. I can only hope that the Tri-Commission is up to the challenge.
 About the Tri-Commission...
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: Hmm, actually, as an outsider, what do you think of the way the Tri-Commission is running at the moment?
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: ...You know what, never mind. I don't think even they know what's going on themselves, let alone you.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: The Kanjou Commission's been buried in mountains of old accounts that need settling ever since their dealings with the outlanders were exposed. I've got no clue whether they'll make it out of this one or not.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: The Tenryou Commission doesn't bear mentioning. The Kujou Clan's situation is very worrying. Who knows what Her Excellency's final judgment will be...
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: The Yashiro Commission on the other hand seems to have come out of these twists and turns even better than before, the whole business with one of their retainers defecting during the Vision Hunt Decree notwithstanding.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: *sigh* Whatever the case, I just hope they can fix this mess. I doubt Her Excellency will have much mercy otherwise.
 About the Almighty Shogun...
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: Inazuma has undergone so many changes in such a short time. In my experience, Her Excellency will not just stand idly by.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: I know I fret a lot, but as an officer of the Shogunate, I have utmost faith in Her Excellency's might.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: Inazuma will move into a new era under her guidance for sure.
(Obtain  Guide to Light ×1)
 Take care of yourself.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: *sigh* Okay, you too.
