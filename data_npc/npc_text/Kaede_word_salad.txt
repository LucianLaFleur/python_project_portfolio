Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Radiant Sakura.


Kaede: Hmm? You're talking to me... Are you a customer?
 Adventure Challenge
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Kaede: Ah, why don't you buy a doll? Maybe it'll give you better luck...
(If the player wins the match)

Kaede: Ack... How? I can't believe I lost because of this...
 So, what's this shop all about?
Kaede: We mainly sell souvenirs, like Inazuman novels, tanuki dolls, and stuff like that.
Kaede: Back then... we might also have sold statues of the Almighty Shogun and other related goods as well.
Kaede: Sadly, we haven't really seen that many customers since the lockdown came into effect except for those Snezhnayan merchants who want to entertain their families.
 What kinds of dolls?
Kaede: Our featured products are statues  of fox spirits and porcelain tanuki dolls. Uh... tanuki dolls sell a bit better.
Kaede: They represent good fortune in Inazuma. Many business owners buy one to place in their stores, hoping for financial success.
Kaede: They look really cute as well! It's not a bad idea to gift them to your favorite girl or the children in your family.
 Statues of the Shogun?
Kaede: Yeah, our Almighty Shogun is a merciful and forgiving person who doesn't really mind people buying the statues for any reason whatsoever.
Kaede: *sigh* It used to be our best-selling product...
Kaede: Sadly, we've lost our customer base ever since the lockdown happened. And such a delicate item is not cheap to craft, so we've had no choice but to take them off the shelves.
 Goodbye.
Kaede: *sigh* So you're not here to buy anything after all, are you...

 Statues of the Shogun?
Kaede: Yeah, our Almighty Shogun is a merciful and forgiving person who doesn't really mind people buying the statues for any reason whatsoever.
Kaede: Before the Sakoku Decree was instated, it used to be our best-selling product... But the old edition long ceased production.
Kaede: I've heard that a new model is being developed, though...
Kaede: I should keep an eye on developments on that front. This is a business after all... But it's such a bother...
 Goodbye.

Event Dialogue[]
Hues of the Violet Garden[]

(After looking for Yae Miko in Festive Elegance)
Kaede: Wow. The Irodori Festival hasn't started yet, and there are already so many people on Ritou...
Kaede: Well, dear customer, you'll have to wait till the festival starts to get one of our Statues of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder!
Kaede: ...Ah, you're not here about the Shogun Statues? Sorry, we've just gotten so many queries concerning those recently.
(Continue non-event dialogue)
(After completing The Strange Tale of Suikou's Tipsy Tincture)
Kaede: I never thought that Ritou would play host to a festival by the Yae Publishing House, nor that this many people would show up.
Kaede: Thanks to the Irodori Festival, our Inazuman products and toys have been very popular indeed, even those that aren't necessarily part of our event-specific promotions.
