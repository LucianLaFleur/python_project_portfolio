Story[]
Nick was part of an expedition to Sal Vindagnyr organized by Landrich to quell the desire of those who hope to rebel against the aristocracy. Besides him, the expedition also included Ingbert, Eberhart, Luther, and several unnamed aristocrats.[1]
Sometime after arriving at the mountain, the team gets caught in a snowstorm and the unnamed members get separated from the others, who meet up at the South Base Camp. Eberhart convinces the others that the unnamed members must find their way back to camp. He also convinces them to investigate a secret room, which must contain murals and weapons forged from silver.[2]
After a while, Nick dies in the cave, burying food and fuel with him.[3]
