Dialogue[]
Before starting A Gifted Rose

Affan: Why? Why won't they grow?
 Um, hello?
Affan: ...Another merchant here to sell their wares, are you? Ugh, how many does this make...
Affan: Not that it matters. I do not lack for food or clothing, nor do I have any savings. Whatever you're selling, go sell it to someone else.
Affan: I've got flowers to plant, as you can see. If you're not here about that, don't disturb me.
 See you.
Affan: Yes, yes, go hawk your wares to someone else. See you... Actually, no. I don't wish to see you again.

After completing A Gifted Rose: Some People Never Fade Away

Affan: ♪ ... Ah. It's you. Come, come. These flowers are growing well, are they not?
 So, about the folk song...
Affan: Ah, so you've remembered it, eh? Well, that makes one more young person who knows it. Good, good.
Affan: "Rose, oh roses, grant me my wish. Blooming from the stone, the Golden Rose sang to me."
Affan: "No land but folk songs bore my spirit. Songs shall defy my fate, and overcome my destiny."
Affan: "They will surpass me, surpass time. They will surpass the ever-lasting withering of life..."
 See you.
Affan: You have a good heart, child. May the gods watch over you and that heart of yours. See you.
