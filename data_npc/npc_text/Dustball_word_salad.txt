(Talk to Razor after reaching Trusted with Dustball)
Razor: ...
Dustball: ...Meow.
Razor: ...It's you. Me, I'm talking.
Paimon: Talking... Razor, are you talking to Dustball?
Dustball: Meow, meow-meow.
Paimon: It seems like Dustball is trying to say... "That's right"?
Razor: A familiar scent, looking for friends.
Razor: It is good. Happy.
Dustball: Meow, meow.
Razor: Friends followed the scent. You came too, happy. On your body, the smell of wind and rain, very familiar... The scent of cats, also familiar.
Razor: Paimon, very sweet scent. Smell good.
Paimon: Eh!? Sweet... Could that be the flavor of the pancakes Valerina gave us? D—Did Paimon eat that many?
 I gave you half of my portion, remember?
 No sweat, you can still eat triple what you ate before.
Paimon: Really? Paimon didn't even notice... Mmm, it's all the pancake's fault for being so delicious!
Paimon: Hehe, and Paimon also wants to eat Sweet Madames, Steaks, and Hash Browns... oh, and drink some Apple Cider!
Paimon: Okay, that's the menu for the next meal then! C'mon, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), let's go place our order with Valerina! You come too, Razor!
Razor: Thank... Thank you...
Razor: Dustball has brought me lots of... nuts...
Razor: And, meat boxes... I am very full.
Paimon: Sounds like Valerina ordered delivery, then? Did Dustball deliver the food to you, Razor?
Dustball: Meow-meow. Meow!
Paimon: Paimon never imagined that the cats would actually end up taking care of the customers here in the Furball Fortress!
Paimon: Looks like you really are the cat's meow, eh, Razor?
(Talk to Razor again, optional)
Razor: Seeing lupical, I am happy.
 Razor, are you acquainted with Dustball?
 It feels like you already knew each other.
Razor: It, sleeps outside city wall. Takes me there. Very comfy.
Razor: It has many friends, many, outside city... starving...
Razor: Inside the city, there's food... Me, hunting, there's food.
Paimon: Oh, so you already made friends with Dustball outside the city...
 Sounds like you do have quite a few friends out there.
Paimon: Then, they deliver the food out to their friends outside...
Paimon: Why don't those little cats just come inside the city? Sure, the walls might be a little high, but there's shelter from the wind and rain and plenty to eat!
Razor: They like, butterflies flying high. They don't like, places without wind.
Razor: ...Dustball different. Like people more.
Razor: He wants to give food to friends. His friends like human food.
Paimon: They like human food, but don't want to live in the city. Those are some pretty fickle cats!
Razor: He wants to bring friends, inside. Use food, bring them inside.
 Convincing cats to come inside with food...
 That actually might do the trick...
Paimon: But if we bring all those cats over here from outside, will the Furball Fortress be able to handle it?
Paimon: If this place was really filled to the brim with all kinds of cats, Valerina would be really happy, but the funds might...
Razor: Cats good, food good, hungry, bad. I will help!
 Anyway, we should make sure that the cats are fed first.
Paimon: Yeah, no matter what, we should take care of delivering the food before anything else. If only we could convince them to come live in the city...
 And we need to explain things to Valerina...
Paimon: That's right, after all, the costs of running this Furball Fortress are all coming right out of her pocket.
 Razor, how are the cats outside the city doing right now?
Razor: Past few days, brought food to friends. Now, they not hungry.
Paimon: Phew... That's a relief. Now that we don't have to worry about the cats suffering from hunger pangs while we speak, we can go discuss this with Valerina...
Razor: Thank you, Lupical. When with you, no need to worry.
