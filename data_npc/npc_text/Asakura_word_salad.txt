Asakura's LocationAdditional context
Profile[]
Asakura serves as a Doushin in the Tenryou Commission, stationed in Tenshukaku. At some point prior to the Traveler's arrival, he was returning with a group of his fellow Doushin when they came upon a vagrant crew about to raid a merchant convoy. He and the others sprung into action, but another group of vagrants ambushed and put them on the defensive. The combined vagrants taunted and teased the Doushin before their Kairagi leader challenged Asakura and defeated him due to a lack of stamina, taking his weapon. While Asakura was given a new weapon, he was upset and angered by his loss, posting a commission at the Adventurers' Guild to look for a training partner, albeit anonymously due to the shame he felt.
The Traveler took up his commission and learned why he had put the commission. After training with him several times, he managed to locate the vagrants that had stolen his weapon. The vagrants greatly underestimated the Traveler and were promptly defeated by them, allowing Asakura to duel their leader in a fair fight. Asakura prevailed, severely injuring the Kairagi leader and reclaiming his old weapon. He thanked the Traveler for their efforts and asked them to continue training with him in the future.
When Kujou Sara stormed Tenshukaku to inform the Shogun of the deception she had learned, she easily swatted Asakura aside.

Appearance[]
Asakura wears a standard uniform modeled from the ashigaru (Japanese: 足軽) of feudal Japan. He wears a purple-gray shitagi, gray kobakama, white socks, and waraji sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with gray accents consists of dou (breastplate) with the Inazuma Shogunate's crest, han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves). He is equipped with a juumonji yari (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead.

Dialogue[]

Asakura: He—Hello, how can I help you?
 Did I scare you?
Asakura: Ah, you're the Traveler. How do you do? This is the side gate, and few people pass this way... so you really did give me a fright there, ahaha...
Asakura: This gate leads to the Tenshukaku, the residence of our Almighty Shogun, so please refrain from doing anything reckless here.
 Goodbye.
Asakura: Goodbye.
