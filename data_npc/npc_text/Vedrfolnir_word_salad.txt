Voice Inside the Head"Sinner"




  Quest-Exclusive NPCs 




Vedrfolnir is a quest-exclusive NPC that first appears during the Archon Quest A Lamenter at Fate's End in Chapter III: Act VI - Caribert as Voice Inside the Head.
During the events of Archon Quest Memories That Should Not Exist in Chapter IV: Act VI - Bedtime Story, Dainsleif reveals that the "Sinner" Traveler encountered in their sibling's memories is his older brother Vedrfolnir, one of the Five Sinners of Khaenri'ah.

Profile[]
Skirk learned about Vedrfolnir from her master and assumed that Vedrfolnir is potentially famous enough for other people to have heard of him.[2] Like the other people she mentioned, Vedrfolnir shares the same desire for perfection as her master.
Vedrfolnir was unparalled in his field and Dainsleif believed that if he and the other Five Sinners worked together, they could have stopped the Vinster King from rocking the foundation of the world. However, they eventually succumbed to temptation of the Abyss and shared a power that could destroy Teyvat. Despite this new power, he did not rush to protect his nation when it was attacked by the gods, causing Dainsleif to sever ties with him. 
The Traveler suspects that the stone tablets they found regarding the Prophecy of Fontaine were likewise placed by him.

Appearance[]
At some point, Vedrfolnir had a consciousness in the form of an irregular rhombic crystal with six chains holding it up. The crystal glows a bright purple due to the Abyssal energy inside it. It is orbited by smaller fragments of crystal and has darker, cracked spots on its surface. The crystal is attached to the ceiling by several chains.

Story[]
History[]
Prior to the cataclysm, Vedrfolnir was one of six individuals of great esteem in Khaenri'ah who carried the hopes of their nation and were seen as the best of their peers within their respective fields of work. However, he and four others were unable to resist the call of the Abyss and were said to have divided up amongst themselves a power that could destroy the world. They would be seen as Sinners and would each become transcendent beings in possession of "world-shattering power".
Neither Vedrfolnir nor the other Sinners did anything to try and prevent the cataclysm from happening, and once the tragedy occurred, not one of them tried to defend Khaenri'ah. Because of this, his younger brother Dainsleif resents them, claiming that he will never forgive them.

After the Cataclysm[]
Sometime after the cataclysm, Traveler's Sibling and Chlothar explored the Unknown Sanctuary, where they found Vedrfolnir in the form of a levitating crystal wrapped in chains. He had a mysterious power which compelled nearby sentient organisms, including Chlothar and some hilichurls but excluding the Traveler (reliving their sibling's experience) and possibly their sibling, to worship him. He was protected by an Abyss Herald: Frost Fall, who did not allow humans to come near him.
As Chlothar prostrated himself before Vedrfolnir, both he and the Traveler (within their sibling's memory) independently heard Vedrfolnir's voice inside their head, calling them "dear creature" and questioning them as to why they were bowing, as he was a "Sinner" and not a god. However, he stated that he "[knows their] fate well" and urged them to become a "transcendent one," stating he would "shed a tear at the end of time... as I gaze back upon your life." He imbued Chlothar with the power of the Abyss, which alleviated his worsening conditions as he immediately felt better than before entering the sanctuary. Later, Chlothar was finally able to restore Caribert's sentience and speech.[3] Astounded at the miracle Vedrfolnir had performed, Chlothar disavowed The Seven and began worshipping him instead. When the Sibling and Chlothar returned to the Sanctuary later, the chained object, its hilichurl worshippers, and Vedrfolnir's voice were absent, but Chlothar was sure that everything was real and not illusion nor dream since he could still feel its "awesome and wondrous power flowing through his mind and body". Given that Chlothar later went on to establish the Abyss Order,[4] it is likely that the Order worships the Vedrfolnir as a key part of its creed.
At some point before his death, Chlothar used Abyssal power to create the Defiled Statue.[4] During the encounter with Vedrfolnir, the Traveler likens the crystal to the Defiled Statue and the worshipping hilichurls to the deceased Grand Thief, which they had discovered during the Archon Quest Involuntary Sacrifice in Chapter I: Act IV - We Will Be Reunited.[3]
After Traveler informs Dainsleif about their sibling's memories and the crystal, he has his suspicions as to who this individual is, but decides to investigate the matter before giving the Traveler his conclusion. He also tells them that if the "Sinner" is who he thinks it is, then "that person" had seen the Traveler through the memory, although the events of those memories had happened centuries in the past.[4]
After further investigation, Dainsleif confirms with the Traveler that Vedrfolnir is the "Sinner" they encountered.

Trivia[]
The authorial intent may have been to suggest that Vedrfolnir provided Fontaine's prophecy.
The concept of "visionaries" as people with great, real power in Genshin Impact was never mentioned before Mona's dialogue in the Archon Quest Hunters, Prophets in Chapter IV: Act V - Masquerade of the Guilty. Skirk names Vedrfolnir with the title "The Visionary" only two quests later, in the Archon Quest The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur in Chapter IV: Act V - Masquerade of the Guilty.
According to Mona during Hunters, Prophets, Fontaine's prophecy is of too great a magnitude for ordinary astrologists to read, and someone who is strong enough to read such a prophecy can be called a "visionary." Additionally, Fontaine's prophecy in particular is so powerful that the one who provided the prophecy must be a powerful visionary. Mona's information about visionaries and the potential individual who provided the prophecy is not further elaborated upon by the end of Archon Quest Chapter IV: Act V - Masquerade of the Guilty.
The only names and titles Skirk mentioned were those of Surtalogi, Vedrfolnir, and Gold. Paimon tries to ask for more information on the only completely unknown figure, the "'Visionary' person,"[Note 1] but is interrupted by the news of Fontaine's prophecy apparently coming to completion at that very moment. No further information about Vedrfolnir was provided by the end of Masquerade of the Guilty.
Etymology[]
In Norse mythology, Veðrfölnir is a hawk sitting between the eyes of an unnamed eagle perched atop the world tree Yggdrasil.
Notes[]

↑ Skirk had already introduced Surtalogi as her master, and Paimon recognized "Gold" Rhinedottir.
