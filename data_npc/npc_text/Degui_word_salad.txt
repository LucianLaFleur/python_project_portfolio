 That's not being honest...
Media:VO Degui 01.ogg "That's not being honest, that's just plain stupid!"
 ...Are these really Dandelions from Mondstadt? ...Are you sure? (only during the commission Wine, With a Taste of Freedom)

Dialogue[]

Degui: How many times have I told you? If you can't get the basics right, how am I... how are you going to make any money!?
Zhiruo: But I think...
Degui: Oh, I know full well what you think! You think these customers should be able to eat their fill, pay a fair price for it and then be on their jolly way! Tell me, how exactly do you plan to make any money that way?
Degui: It's simple math: If you halve the portion size, each guest has to order twice as much, and you've doubled your income just like that!
Zhiruo: ...
Degui: And another thing. Do you have any idea how expensive this wine is? You have to be more sparing with it! You only need to add a little bit to the food — just enough to taste.
Zhiruo: But the customers were complaining that the boozy desserts didn't seem to have any booze in them...
Degui: You don't listen to the customers! You listen to me, do you understand!? Do the customers pay your salary? No! I do! They say it's bland, you tell them it's supposed to be bland! They ask why, you make something up!
Degui: Tell them it's an acquired taste or something... get them to order it again! Just... whatever you do, don't go sending people away after you've already managed to get them in the shop!
