He has a rivalry with Uyuu Restaurant.

Appearance[]

Dialogue[]

Shimura Kanbei: Welcome! Come try Shimura's fine cuisine!
 I'd like to see the menu.
Shimura Kanbei: We serve great local cuisine here. Satisfaction guaranteed!
 About Shimura's...
Shimura Kanbei: How do you like it? The food's got that authentic flavor, eh?
Shimura Kanbei: Back in the days, I was just a poor samurai without a single dime to my name. I started Shimura's from the ground up. Every plank and every window here, I installed by hand.
Shimura Kanbei: I manage every ingredient, every sauce and every change in cooking temperature. It's guaranteed to be top-notch. Even Uyuu Restaurant can't compete with us!
 You used to be a samurai?
Shimura Kanbei: Hmm? Oh yeah... But it's been decades. Nothing worth talking about.
Shimura Kanbei: I was too naive back then. I only thought of serving and dying for the cause, or building some track record, or becoming a Hatamoto.
Shimura Kanbei: I kept going until my hair turned gray and my parents were long gone...
Shimura Kanbei: At that point, I finally realized that I was all alone in this world, and yet I still hadn't figured out who I was supposed to be yet...
Shimura Kanbei: Thankfully, I still have this restaurant. I've been working at it for decades.
Shimura Kanbei: Can you imagine it? It took decades for me to realize that I'm more suitable to being a small business owner than a warrior.
 What's up with Uyuu Restaurant?
Shimura Kanbei: Hmph, what about them? They've been just around a bit longer than us, have a little more staff than us and have classier decorations... Well, and the owner has a better background. That's all there is to their popularity!
Shimura Kanbei: I walked past that place several days ago, and they insisted on inviting me in. Of course, I knew they were just testing me!
Shimura Kanbei: My restaurant is just at the, uh, start-up stage! Just give me a bit of time, and I'll be better than them for sure!
 Goodbye.
Shimura Kanbei: Take care. Come back if you ever want more!

Event Dialogue[]
Hues of the Violet Garden[]

Shimura Kanbei: A few days ago, a handsome young fellow came here to eat. From the way he dressed, he was probably from Liyue.
Shimura Kanbei: But when I asked him if he was here to take part in the Irodori Festival, he shifted his gaze away, and he tried to divert the conversation.
Shimura Kanbei: That's rather odd.
Shimura Kanbei: Indeed. But he dressed so well. I don't think he could have been some sort of troublemaker...
