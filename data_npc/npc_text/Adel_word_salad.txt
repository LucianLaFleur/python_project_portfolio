Dialogue[]

Adel: That's the way young people should be. Sails unfurled, revved up, ready to go and all that, just like these boats...
 Are you gazing at the sea?
Adel: At the sea? No, no... I'm an officer of the law, from the Akademiya. Everyone calls me Master Adel.
Adel: Simply put, it is the job of the Navbed to inspect a port's comings and goings. I inspect them in turn.
Adel: You can think of me as their superior.
 But you were clearly gazing out to sea...
Adel: *cough* I was simply keeping an eye on the ships out at sea. Gotta make sure the Navbed aren't slacking off and all.
Adel: Don't you take me for some skiving old man, now!
 Youngsters heading out to sea?
Adel: Indeed! I mean, look at them, all fired up like that.
Adel: When I was a lad, I too had the sea as my home, and I sailed everywhere on a patrol boat, even up to the border with Natlan. I'd go out there again if I could!
 Have you been to Natlan?
Adel: Natlan's youths are as energetic as our own... No, in fact, I'd call what they have something else.
Adel: It's almost as if... their souls were forged for battle from birth.
Adel: Don't mistake my meaning, they aren't barbarians! On the contrary, they love street graffiti, showing off and comparing fashionable trinkets...
Adel: It's a colorful, contradictory, charming place.
Adel: Come to think of it, I'm practically getting younger over here, and yet our head administrator's always using "you need more rest" as an excuse to leave me idle.
Adel: *cough*...
 I'll be off now.
Adel: Haha, guess my only true companions are the wind and waves, eh?
