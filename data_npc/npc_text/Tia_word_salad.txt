Dialogue[]

Tia: Hello. You must be from somewhere very far away?
 What's your name?
Tia: My name is Tia. Landa's my father.
 Tell me about your father.
Tia: My father says I should tell all strangers that he is a traveling merchant.
Tia: If you're friends with Tia, then I can tell you the truth!
 How does one make friends with you, then?
Tia: Easy, you just need to play with me.
Tia: But right now I'm playing with Richie and Wei!
 Has traveling been fun?
Tia: Yup! This is my first time outside Mondstadt. Everything here is so cool!
Tia: When I was small, I could only read "Vera's Melancholy." I would imagine I was Vera, experiencing all kinds of amazing adventures!
Tia: I know! I'll give you this copy of "Vera's Melancholy." I might have flipped through it a bit too much...
Tia: But I don't need it anymore, because I'm on a real adventure with Daddy. My experiences will be even more interesting than the novel!
(Obtain  Vera's Melancholy (I))
 Bye-bye.
Tia: Bye-bye!

Event Dialogue[]
Unreconciled Stars[]

Tia: Are dreams black, or white? Are they another world? I can never remember what happened in my dreams when I wake up.
Tia: But everyone's saying that if you touch those strange stones, you'll sleep for a long, long time. If I dream for that long, I'll definitely remember my dream, right?

Fleeting Colors in Flight[]

Tia: *sigh* Why won't the grownups let us go up to the roof?
Tia: There was a little girl just now who wanted to go up to the roof to see the fireworks, but that green-haired guy next to her wouldn't allow it...
Tia: I heard that they had something else they needed to do...Well, I'm free right now, but Daddy still won't let me up on the roof! What's with that?

Trivia[]
Tia and Landa may be mentioned in Noelle's second Character Story. The merchant in Noelle's story went to Mondstadt with plans to ruin their wine industry but ultimately fled the country with his family, a daughter, out of fear of Noelle's apparent ability to read his mind — which was really just an extension of her dutiful nature.
Tia has a message on the Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board.
