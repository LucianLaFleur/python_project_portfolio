Profile[]
Morgen is one of Chaussivert's crew members. He was bought by Covault alongside Pattyn to eliminate the Traveler, Paimon, Fusilier and Lemarcq, who were trying to track Nacker after he stole an Arkhium core from the Fontaine Research Institute. As Covault led the group to the ambush site, Morgen stayed behind on the ship alongside Lemarcq. When the ambush started, he tried to overpower Lemarcq, but was swiftly rendered unconscious by him, having been given the Pneumousia Ray Self-Defence Device by Fusilier. Returning to Chaussivert's ship, the Traveler realizes that Concini, Loillier and Nacker were all in leagues with each other. Lemarcq suggested interrogating him and Pattyn for information, which Chaussivert agreed with and warned the Traveler, Paimon and Fusilier to put some earplugs when they slept as it would not be a silent night.
It is heavily implied that during that night, after interrogation, Chaussivert and Lemarcq threw Pattyn and Morgen overboard after getting all they could from them, leaving them to drown in the sea.
