Story[]
In the distant past, the Heavenly Principles descended on Teyvat and established a new order over the world. In an attempt to quell and defeat the usurper, Nibelung acquired the forbidden knowledge from outside this world and led the other ancient dragons into war against it, believing this power was the key to victory.[1]
Instead, this war caused immense destruction on an unprecedented scale and led the world to the brink of collapse. Nibelung's war eventually ended in his and his race's defeat and his own demise. With the right to "shape the world," the Heavenly Principles cast down the Divine Nails to mend the earth after its destruction; however, this act also devastated the beings which had lived on the surface of Teyvat. Even after seeing the former rainforests in its domain turn into desert through the power of the divine nail, Apep nonetheless attempted to turn the tides by acquiring more forbidden knowledge, but ultimately failed and only became corrupted by the power it had sought.[1]
While reminiscing on its motivations for making a deal with King Deshret, Apep says that "At that time, I still harbored deep regrets. By the time the Dragon King returned, the world had irrevocably changed."[1] This may suggest that a new Dragon King was born before Apep made the deal with Deshret.

Etymology[]
The Germanic term Nibelung has several, sometimes conflicting, uses in Norse and Germanic myth, and its exact etymology is unknown. The popular theory is that it is derived from nibel "mist, cloud" and that the word was often used for, or may have originally meant, mystical beings. The term Nibelung in legend has usually referred to either a group of humans or a group of dwarves.
The term Nibelung in Genshin Impact is likely derived from Richard Wagner's four-part opera Der Ring des Nibelungen "The Ring of the Nibelung" (which is based on various Germanic and Norse legends and sagas), in which the dwarf (or Nibelung) Alberich creates a ring capable of controlling the world, using gold he stole from the Rhinemaidens (or Rheintöchter "Rhine-daughters"). The conflict that arises over the ownership of this ring eventually leads to the destruction of the gods and their home, Valhalla.
The Alberich Clan and "Gold" Rhinedottir are other names directly taken from Der Ring des Nibelungen. Notably, both the Alberich Clan and Rhinedottir played a prominent role during the cataclysm 500 years ago, in which a resurgence of Abyssal power and forbidden knowledge came from Khaenri'ah, resulting in its destruction at the hands of the Heavenly Principles and the gods.
