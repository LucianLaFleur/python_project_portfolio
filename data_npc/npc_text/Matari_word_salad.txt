Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Mahshid: Next time someone wants to trade shifts with you, don't agree to it!
Matari: Yes, ma'am.
Mahshid: You Eremites are too used to idling in the desert to know the importance of rules!
Mahshid: If everyone switched shifts at will and didn't follow schedule, it would turn into a big mess!
Matari: Yes, you are right.
Mahshid: Even though you're a mercenary hired by the Akademiya, your job of keeping law and order on the docks is as crucial as the researchers', got it?
Matari: Yes, I got it.

Matari: Yeah, very likely.
Mahshid: Say, am I unworthy of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's legacy by being so mediocre?
