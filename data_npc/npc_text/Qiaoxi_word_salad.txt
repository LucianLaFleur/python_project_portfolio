Dialogue[]

Qiaoxi: Normally, everyone who wishes to cross this bridge is subject to interrogation.
Qiaoxi: I spy a traveler in exotic attire... What are you doing here?
 Exotic attire?
Qiaoxi: Yes. You're dressed very ostentatiously indeed... So you're definitely not someone to worry about.
Qiaoxi: Think about it. Criminals would want to dress as discreetly as possible, no?
Qiaoxi: That's based on my experience guarding this bridge, in any case.
 Tell me about your work.
Qiaoxi: As long as this bridge is here, someone needs to guard it! We can't afford to let our guard down, not for one second.
Qiaoxi: The bridge is a major thoroughfare. So to be handed the job of guarding it is the highest recognition I could ask for.
Qiaoxi: I will never let our enemies have their way, even if it costs me my life!
 Still only you stationed here?
Qiaoxi: Yeah, the higher-ups said there's no one else they could free up...
Qiaoxi: But never mind. As long as this bridge stands, I'll be here guarding it.
 Have you seen someone who looks a lot like me?
Qiaoxi: Does the person you want to find dress as... uniquely as you?
Qiaoxi: In that case, I've never seen anyone like that. But if they do, that should definitely leave an impression.
Qiaoxi: I remember everyone who crosses this bridge, never mind someone with such an unusual appearance.
Qiaoxi: I'll keep a look out on your behalf. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail.
 See you.
Qiaoxi: Alright, off you go. Tread gently on the bridge, now. Don't step on anything.
