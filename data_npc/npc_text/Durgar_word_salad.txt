Media:VO Durgar All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Durgar: (Why do people use "wooden" to describe inflexible people? Timber is very malleable!)

Dialogue[]

Durgar: Thanks to the blessings of Lesser Lord Kusanali, the newly arrived wood is very sturdy and barely has any quality issues.
 And you are...
Durgar: Good day. I am the carpenter here. If you need any woodwork done, I'm your guy.
Durgar: I handle everyone's carpentry needs around here. Fair prices and reliable quality guaranteed.
Durgar: The newly arrived wood is really something — firm, durable, and has a beautiful texture. If you'd like to let me build you something with this lumber, you'd better make up your mind quick.
Durgar: This is a blessing from Lesser Lord Kusanali. I must make sure every piece of it is made into quality products.
 About Lesser Lord Kusanali...
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

Durgar: The fact that Sumeru people are living in a place where trees and flowers flourish instead of struggling amidst barren deserts is all thanks to the kindness of the Lord Kusanali.
Durgar: Greater Lord Rukkhadevata left roots and nutrients to Sumeru, which have now been inherited and protected by Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Durgar: So now, all our harvests are born from her mercy.
Durgar: And since I live by carpentry, which is closely related to trees, I am even more grateful to the Dendro Archon!
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

Durgar: The fact that Sumeru people are living in a place where trees and flowers flourish instead of struggling amidst barren deserts is all thanks to the kindness of Lord Kusanali.
Durgar: She lay down the roots and fertilized the land — all our harvests, whether in the field or in life, stem from her.
Durgar: And since carpentry's how I make my living, a trade that's plenty close to the trees, I'm all the more grateful to the Dendro Archon!
 See you.
Durgar: Goodbye! Come to me if you need any woodworking done!
