Jarjar: Ah la la, ah la la~ Harder, farther, with more interesting designs. This will surely impress Lady Sorush~
 About Lightcall Resonance...
Jarjar: Hm? Sorush's Yasnapati? You came!
Jarjar: I'm still trying to come up with how to make a more interesting race track. Don't be too impatient now.
Jarjar There will be opportunities for you and Lady Sorush to truly enjoy yourselves!
 About Sorush...
Jarjar: Since Lady Sorush mentioned it, remember to come try out the new Lightcall Resonance challenge when you get the chance...
Jarjar: So, I need to plan future challenges just perfectly to achieve the desired effect.
Jarjar: I can't let Lady Sorush feel too bored, but I also can't make them too troublesome either!
 I'll let you be busy!
Jarjar: Not busy at all! If you want to chat, come find me any time.

Trivia[]
Jarjar's name is likely a reference to the Star Wars character Jar Jar Binks.
While Jarjar does exist as a word in both Arabic and Persian, the meaning is not relevant to the character.
