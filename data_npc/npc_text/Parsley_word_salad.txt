Dialogue[]

Rosemary: We can't go on like this. This Dandelion Sea, there's no way to find it, is there?
Rosemary: It's a fairy tale, a fantasy. But... should I tell him, or shouldn't I?
Parsley: That may be so, but, humans can never leave their fantasies aside.
Parsley: Only if we dream can we have hope, and with hope comes opportunity.
Parsley: Surely you haven't forgotten that snowy day in Snezhnaya, when you were my Boar Princess, and I was your wolf pup?
Rosemary: Oh, Parsley... just as we once dreamed to ascend to Celestia— No, even now, we...
Parsley: Indeed. Even for another moment, let's allow little Sage to enjoy the fantasies of his youth.

Trivia[]
Parsley, Rosemary, and Sage are all named after herbs. This may be a reference to the lyrics of the traditional English ballad, Scarborough Fair, in which the line "Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme" form part of the refrain.
