Profile[]
Spartacus was the leader of a resistance against the Sunchildren and the nobles that controlled Byakuyakoku. However, he was captured by the Sunchildren and imprisoned at the shrine in the Serpent's Heart where he eventually died. Due to the nature of the Dainichi Mikoshi, his shade remained long after his death and would be discovered by the Traveler and Paimon thousands of years later.
Spartacus was initially relieved to see someone but realized the Traveler was not a member of the resistance. He wanted them to relay a message to his comrades, but he had forgotten his name and the phrase needed. After being informed of his name, he began to gradually remember everything and asked them to inform his comrades to continue fighting the nobility. The Traveler arrived at the location and met Adonis, who told them that after Spartacus' capture, the resistance collapsed as they lacked funds — once they did from acquiring Dragonbone Orbs, the resistance collapsed anyways due to their greed being sated and that if Spartacus had been around, he would have stopped it from the start.

Appearance[]
Like most shades, Spartacus is a translucent humanoid figure without defining physical features.

Etymology[]
Supada no Hiko's Enkanomiya name "Spartacus" is likely derived from Spartacus, the Thracian gladiator and leader of the escaped slave leaders in Third Servile War.
