Kadenokouji Kenzaburou is a light novel writer. He once submitted an excellent but conventional manuscript to Yae Publishing House, prompting Yae Miko to request her editors to "tell him that there's no need to bother about genre. He just needs to write his story and write it well." After a few months, Kenzaburou submitted a Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden manuscript that stunned the editors but greatly pleased Miko, who only requested that Kenzaburou change his ordinary pen name. Miko approved the pen name "Kadenokouji Kenzaburou."[1]
Kenzaburou later participates in the signing event during the Irodori Festival along with Zhenyu and Satomi.[2][3]
