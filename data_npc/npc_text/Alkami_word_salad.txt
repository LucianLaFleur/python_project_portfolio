Kaveh's senior from his days as a student at the Akademiya. After the Traveler suggests that Kaveh pursue a different career path after his conflict with his client Badawi, Kaveh mentions that Alkami found success as an architect without taking private commissions and decides to seek out his guidance, discovering that he now runs a training center. 
He offers to let Kaveh become a teacher in his training center, offering him a generous sum of Mora per session to work for him and promising to teach him his worth as the Light of the Kshahrewar, although this turns out to be a ruse to use Kaveh's celebrity status in Sumeru to boost his enrollment numbers, since Alkami, who is untalented as an architect, struggled to attract students looking for professional training on his own.
During his first class as a lecturer, Kaveh discovers that Alkami never intended to teach his students anything valuable, as his curriculum consisted solely of having students memorize existing designs rather than teaching them how to conceptualize and create them, all while charging his students exorbitant tuition fees and selling them false promises of achieving riches as architects once they graduate and enter the field. Those who couldn't afford his tuition were referred to a loan shark with whom he collaborated named Fakhr, who would manipulate them into signing contracts that locked them into paying off not only the debt they incurred but also the absurdly high interest fees for the rest of their lives, making Alkami and Fakhr rich in the process and adding to the illusion that Alkami made his fortune through his own architectural achievements rather than through illegitimate means. This agreement between him and Fakhr ultimately leads to Alkami and his training center's demise, as Kaveh and the Traveler are able to report his schemes to the Matra, who shuts down the training center for investigation and return a portion of the Mora Alkami obtained from his students to their families. 
While it is unknown what will happen to Alkami after his training center closes, Kaveh takes Alkami's former students Waiz, Tanisha, and Uzayr under his wing to teach on his days off and implies that he will accept Alkami's other students who decide to continue attending these classes.
