Profile[]
Unlike most other females, Itaru is big as a bear and strong as a tiger. She also had a wild and unruly personality. Despite Hakushin's rigorous training, Itaru's personality remains unchanged, often drinking and breaking things.[1] However, she has also achieved many merits such as defeating and taming the Twin Oni of Tokaku,[2] and even exposing a tanuki disguised as a dishonest merchant.[3]
