Media:VO Dwarkanath All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Dwarkanath: (Why does Iradj want a claymore? He can't even wield a scimitar properly!)
Dialogue[]

Dwarkanath: It seems like a lot of merchant ships have been coming and going lately. I wonder if any of them sell weapons...
 You want to buy a weapon?
Dwarkanath: I'm fine myself, I already have a handy one. It's just that my brother Iradj is always going on about how he wants a Claymore and he asked me to keep an eye out for one.
Dwarkanath:  Strange, just where can I buy a sword that's not only fit for purpose, but also looks nice? I asked him why he wants it, but he just hemmed and hawed without giving me a clear answer...
Dwarkanath:  Ah! Maybe he wants to buy it as a gift for a girl somewhere? But... which girl would want a greatsword as a gift?
 See you.
Dwarkanath: See you around.
