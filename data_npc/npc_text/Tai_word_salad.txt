Idle Quotes[]

 Ho there, roll up...
Media:VO Tai 01.ogg "Ho there, come! Come and see these rare and precious curios!"

Dialogue[]

Tai: Ho there, come and have a look. Each item here is a treasure you shall find in few other places!
 What are your wares?
Tai: Interested, are we? Well then, allow me to tell you a little something—
Tai: Look at this porcelain bottle, if you will. It may look plain, but it is a true relic, perhaps worth as much as half of Chihu Rock!
Tai: And this censer — legend has it that it has offered incense to Rex Lapis himself for a thousand years, and has become filled with adeptal energy in the process!
Tai: And have I mentioned this teapot? Why, it was once used by Rex Lapis himself. You will never find another like it...
 How much for these?
Tai: How much? Oh no, I never said I was selling. In fact, you couldn't make me sell these.
 So what's with the shop if you're not selling?
Tai: Ha, that's a good one. Whoever said that a shop must needs hawk wares?
Tai: I bought this store here precisely to show these beauties off to any who would pass by.
Tai: Every day, some ignorant bystanders like you will come by and ask me these questions. That said, this is precisely what I want...
 I'm good, bye.
Tai: Sure. Come again if you have time to spare, and I'll spin you another yarn!
