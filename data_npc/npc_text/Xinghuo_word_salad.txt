Profile[]
Xinghuo's partner, Echo, once spoke with a terrible stutter. A wandering adventurer named Alice stumbled upon them one day and concocted a potion to cure it, but it had the unexpected side effect of compelling Echo to perfectly mimic those around him, much to Xinghuo's annoyance.

 That's what I said...
Media:VO Xinghuo 01.ogg "*sigh* That's what I said... So can you stop copying me please?"

Dialogue[]

Xinghuo: *sigh* ...Huh? Oh, hello, traveler. Do you need help with anything?
 What's bothering you?
Xinghuo: *sigh* ...Isn't it obvious?
Xinghuo: That guy keeps imitating everything I say. It's driving me nuts.
 Are you two friends?
Xinghuo: Hmm... I guess. We've known each other for a while.
 Why does he imitate you?
Xinghuo: He used to speak with a stutter until a few years ago, until a Traveler called Alice came along and gave him a bottle of medicine...
Xinghuo: It cured his stutter completely. But then he couldn't stop imitating the way everyone around him speaks...
 See you.
Xinghuo: Goodbye, traveler.

Trivia[]
Xinghuo's dialogue during the second Closed Beta Test was significantly different from his dialogue in the final game and gave an option to begin the now-unavailable World Quest Three Flames Light the Way.[2]
