Profile[]
Qilang is an herbalist that spends his days picking herbs around the abode of Moon Carver, the adeptus. In his youth, he spent many hours reading books from the Wanwen Bookhouse, which is where he obtained his knowledge of herbs.
He has now made a business of it and even sells herbs to Bubu Pharmacy.
This has taken a toll on his body however as he has spent so many hours bent over picking herbs, that he now suffers from severe lower-back pain, to the point that he can barely even bend down to pick said herbs anymore.

Dialogue[]

Qilang: Hey there! Gee, you look as fit as a fiddle! Can't say I don't envy you...
 Who are you?
Qilang: The name's Qilang. I'm nobody special, I just come here to pick herbs.
Qilang: I used to spend all my time down at the Wanwen Bookhouse, devouring every book on the natural world I could get my hands on.
Qilang: I never thought that knowledge would actually come in useful for earning a living.
Qilang: I know every herb and its use off by heart now. Even Bubu Pharmacy buys its medicinal herbs from me.
Qilang: It's take its toll on me though... All this time spent bent over picking herbs has done my lower back in. Now it hurts every time I bend down... *grimace*
 Goodbye.
Qilang: Bye then!
