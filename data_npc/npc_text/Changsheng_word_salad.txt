Story[]
History[]
The Herblord, along with Fujin, was once the servant of an unnamed god and was good friends with Fujin and Lingyuan. Like Fujin, Herblord was close to humanity, and was worshiped as an adeptus during her lifetime. Although her original form was that of a white snake, she took on a human form, using her knowledge to create medicines and save the sick.
When the Archon War came to Liyue, the Herblord's master caused the Bishui River to flood in a final attempt to defeat Rex Lapis, an act which would have destroyed Chenyu Vale. Seeing this, the Herblord and Fujin defected against their god, banding together to save the people of Chenyu Vale. While Lingyuan herded them to shelter, the Herblord fought against their former master, and Fujin climbed Mt. Lingmeng and hurled the Votive Rainjade into the waters. Their collective efforts saved Chenyu Vale, but the Herblord was greatly weakened by the ordeal.[5]
Over time, memory of the "Herblord" dwindled until the name became known only through foggy and fragmented legends.[6] One of her many legends told that she could cure any illness known to mankind.[7]

Becoming Changsheng[]
One day, a desperate doctor who had lost his family to a deadly plague had traveled to the Vale, searching for the Herblord. Arriving at the Herblord's residence, he found only an extremely weakened white snake. Changsheng offered to make the contract known as the "Way of the Dragon-Dragging Jade Snake" and teach him her secret arts of healing, but warned that it would give him powerful healing abilities at the cost of his own health.
Despite the risks, the doctor accepted and the two bonded their lives together, their eyes swapping with each other. Using his own lifeforce and Changsheng, the doctor saved many, at great cost to himself. Before his death, he passed down Changsheng and her contract to his disciple. The doctor's successors used their lifeforce to save countless lives, at the cost of their own. This cycle continued for generations and had at least four successors.
Lingyuan mentions that the Herblord has moved to Liyue Harbor and has found a "home" there, confirming that Changsheng and the Herblord are one and the same.[5]

Present Day[]
When Baizhu's master was on his final days, he sought to use the art to save Jialiang, the husband of his disciple Jiangli, from a rare congenital heart condition. Jiangli refused, as she saw Changsheng's lifeforce manipulation as evil and unnatural, and didn't want him to sacrifice his life for hers, as she cared about him too. Her pleas shook the man and made him question his views, as she'd made him realize that his life and the lives of Changsheng's other contractors were just as valuable as the lives of the patients they sacrificed themselves to save. In his final moments, he left a letter to Baizhu in which he asked him a single thing: "May you find a remedy for this conundrum, which has ailed us so..."
While they stood in front of his master's grave, Baizhu and Changsheng had a conversation. She showed regret at her inability to save her contractors, while Baizhu asked what would happen if he refused the contract and left her without a host. When she said she'd spend her final moments sleeping at Mount Yaojun and wait to be reunited with her late friends, Baizhu accepted the contract to preserve Changsheng's life, to her slight regret. When she showed fear over how many more would accept the contract and give their lives, Baizhu promised her that none would do so and that the contract would end with him. Baizhu was determined to become immortal, and this determination resulted in him being granted a Vision.[8]

Trivia[]
Changsheng shares the same Japanese voice actress with Signora and Bonanus.
Changsheng's Chinese name (长生) translates to "longevity," ironic to the fact that each person she forms a contract with has passed away at a young age.
Baizhu and Changsheng may be inspired from the Chinese Legend of the White Snake, in which a snake immortal helps a struggling herbalist by curing his patients using his divine power.
She apparently wants to learn how to write, but is still practicing the best way to hold a brush with her tail.[9]
