Profile[]
Chamboduc works at the Rag and Bone Shop and is a friend of Alvard. While Alvard is off restocking, he sometimes stands in for him and gets paid to watch the shop. Instead of paying in Mora or Credit Coupons, Alvard lets Chamboduc take his pick of goods at the shop. Chamboduc also joined the shop as he heard that Alvard was a good friend of Wriothesley.[1]
