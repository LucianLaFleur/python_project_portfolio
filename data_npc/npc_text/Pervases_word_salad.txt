By wave and storm I hunt for fish, by wind and snow I slay evil...—Pervases' catchphrase
Pervases was a junior in the Yaksha order of adepti, but perished during the Archon War. On the thousandth anniversary of his death, he performed the Mortal Lingering ritual with a censer and seven-star lamps in order to see modern Liyue. Later, he willingly gives up these objects to the Traveler so that they can perform the Dream Trawler ritual to punish Starsnatcher for impersonating an adeptus.
His favorite food was Grilled Ticker Fish,[4] which was apparently a favorite among many adepti.[5]

Appearance[]
In his human form, Pervases has short, slicked-back black hair and brown eyes. He wears a generic Liyue NPC's red robe. His illuminated beast form, seen only in-game as a statue, is a crane who adorns a necklace of large beads similar to what Xiao wears.

History[]
It is unknown when or how Pervases came to serve Rex Lapis, or his history before becoming a Yaksha, but the Archon personally gave him the name "Pervases." Though Pervases was slain during the Archon War, his spirit managed to linger on, dwelling within the statue of a crane in his run-down temple.
One thousand years later, on the anniversary of his death, the Traveler and Paimon run into him while seeking out a censer and the seven-star lamps so Xiao can teach them to perform the Dream Trawler ritual and punish Starsnatcher for his treachery. He senses Xiao's aura on them — and the burden of karma that Xiao bears. Pervases permits them to take the items they need, despite knowing that this would dispel the Mortal Lingering ritual he performed. After telling them the truth about himself, and leaving a message to deliver to Xiao, his spirit grows dormant again. Afterwards, Wang Ping'an, having discarded his Starsnatcher alias and become repentant, carried out a project to restore Pervases' temple to good condition.
After Rex Lapis saves Xiao in The Chasm, he returns to Pervases' temple to ponder the fate of the Yakshas. It is here that it is revealed that Pervases was close with the Prime Yaksha, Bosacius, and that Xiao regrets that Pervases was one of many examples of a Yaksha who had to pay the ultimate price of death.
