Anthon is the second-youngest child in his family, only being older than Teucer. He believed that the people of Liyue were made of stone; after being stationed there, Tartaglia writes to Tonia to "please break it to Anthon that the residents of Liyue are just boring old ordinary humans, like us."[2] In addition to that, it is implied he believed the Liyue people ate stones as well, with Tartaglia saying in his letter, "They not made of stone, and they don't even eat stones."[2]
