Dialogue[]

Bruneau: Hello. How may I help you?
 Where are we?
(Before completing Masquerade of the Guilty)
Bruneau: This is the Palais Mermonia. This is where all official affairs are handled, and public services are rendered.
Bruneau: Of course, this is also the abode of Lady Furina, the Hydro Archon.
Bruneau: Meetings with her are by appointment only, so please follow the rules and refrain from intruding — there will be consequences otherwise.
 Can I look around the public area?
Bruneau: Hmm... technically, this is an office area, but it is frequented every day by a lot of people who do not work here.
Bruneau: We don't chase away visitors who abide by the rules. As long as you speak softly and do not disturb our staff, you will be fine.

 What is this place?
(After completing Masquerade of the Guilty)
Bruneau: This is the Palais Mermonia, where all official affairs are handled and public services are rendered.
Bruneau: And, of course, it is where Iudex Neuvillette has his office.
Bruneau: If you have any questions about Fontaine's public affairs, this is where you come to ask. But do follow the rules, please. There will be consequences if you cause any trouble.
 Can I look around the public area?
(Same as before)
 Sorry for disturbing you.
Bruneau: It's no trouble. See you.
