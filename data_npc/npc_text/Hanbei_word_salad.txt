  Open-World NPCs 




Hanbei (Japanese: 範兵衛 Hanbee) is an open-world NPC located in Sumeru City, Sumeru.
He was the Tenryou Commission officer in charge of the maintenance of the Mikage Furnace when the Traveler first arrived in Inazuma. He is mentioned several times throughout the World Quest series Tatara Tales, during which his inaction and obsession with bureaucracy is openly criticized by those handling the situation in his stead.
Following the events of the quest series, Hanbei has been relocated from his former position, all but demoted due to his mishandling of the situation. The Traveler meets him in person for the first time in Sumeru, where he was sent to oversee the mushroom trade.

Profile[]
During the events of Tatara Tales, Hanbei was not present in Mikage Furnace to solve the incident caused by the high saturation of Tatarigami.[1] Miyuki and Xavier believe he went to Inazuma City to submit forms and report the incident to powerful individuals instead of taking decisive action himself.[2]
After Xavier and the Traveler finally resolve the situation on their own, Toranosuke informs them of Hanbei's fate: their superior, Mikoshi Genjirou, came to Mikage Furnace to learn about the situation directly. He passed Toranosuke's report to his own superior, who then decided that Hanbei's "praiseworthy" work ethic earned him the illustrious job of being dispatched to Sumeru to oversee the mushroom trade.[3]

Dialogue[]

Hanbei: The mushrooms here don't look too bad. I'll put them on my shopping list...
 And you are...
Hanbei: I'm a public servant for the Inazuma Shogunate. I was sent to Sumeru for my meritorious service.
Hanbei: ...They said I was sent here for my contributions in upholding administrative regulations, but my current assignment doesn't seem to be going too well.
Hanbei: I'm here as a "foreign attaché" to manage the mushroom trade. Sumeru has so many different mushrooms that it's enough to make your head spin. I don't have any fieldwork experience either...
Hanbei: What's more, the Shogunate's been delaying the release of the document I need. When can I officially begin importing mushrooms...?
 See you.
Hanbei: Yeah, see you.
