Dialogue[]

Farrah: Traveler, this canyon is too dangerous for you. Please, keep your distance!
 Did something happen?
Farrah: Recently, lots of monsters have been showing up in the canyon, to the point where we vendors have been chased out.
Farrah: *sigh* If my fruit has all gone rotten when I get it back it'll go all slimy and disgusting when I try to wash it...
 Tell me more about Drunkard Gorge.
Farrah: This used to be a popular route for all the merchant caravans. I used to set up my stall in the canyon earn a few Mora too...
Farrah: Occasionally the odd monster would show up, and if so you just chalk it down to bad luck.
Farrah: But now, everyone's fled the canyon and the merchant caravan is stuck here with no way through.
Farrah: *sigh* It's not the end of the world if I can't sell the fruit, but if it goes rotten that's another story...
 Tell me more about your fruit stand.
Farrah: It's not so much about how much it cost...
Farrah: It's more that once you've got rotten fruit on it, it's a nightmare to clean. The juices go all slimy and stick to it for ages, and the smell is nearly impossible to get rid of...
Farrah: If don't get it cleaned in good time, my wife will kill me when I get back.
 You have my sympathies.
Farrah: *sigh* Thank you for that.
Farrah: Well, I do only have these few fruit on hand, and they won't sell for much. You may as well take them.
(Obtain  Apple ×5)
 Sounds like a lot of trouble.
Farrah: *sigh* I never said it wasn't...
Farrah: I'm a bit of a clean freak as well, so just thinking about cleaning these things is making me nauseous.
Farrah: If only Noelle from the Knights was here. If she were here, all this would be spick and span in no time — even better than new!
Farrah: Still, I feel bad about troubling her to do something this trivial...
 Goodbye.
Farrah: Keep your eyes peeled when you're on the road.
Farrah: *sigh* I think I can smell the fruit rotting...
