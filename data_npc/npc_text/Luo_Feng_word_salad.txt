Dialogue[]

Luo Feng: It's an honor to meet you. Might I ask for your name?
 I'm just an ordinary traveler.
Luo Feng: Don't be so modest!
Luo Feng: You may be young, but I can see that you have infinite potential!
Luo Feng: My name is Luo Feng, a merchant. If you should have need of me in the future, please, do not hesitate to ask.
Luo Feng: Of course, one good turn deserves another — should I ever need your assistance, please come to my aid then!
 What are you doing?
Luo Feng: Why, networking, of course.
Luo Feng: Not many people realize this, but the true value of this Pearl Galley lies in its guests!
Luo Feng: Which of the people who come on board are not movers and shakers of a kind? If I can build rapport with but a few such people, then this trip would have been well worth it.
Luo Feng: Well then, I shan't tarry. I need to get to know some more of these people!
 Well, bye, then.
Luo Feng: The honor is all mine!
