Dialogue[]

Galvana: Huh? Is something wrong?
 There's someone who looks just like you...
Galvana: You've met Galvaryet? She's my younger sister. We're twins. *ahem* She's too old to keep calling me Sis all the time...
Galvana: Oh, please don't take it the wrong way. I don't dislike her at all, it's just... This is our workplace, and we should be more serious when it's work hours!
(Obtain  Guide to Order ×1)
 About the Rift of Erosion...
Galvana: Hmm. Yes, it is definitely a potential danger. Would you also agree it would be better to seal it off?
 That's not what I said.
Galvana: Hmm. Now that I think about it, it's not that small a space. It would be great if we could put it to good use...
 I'm in favor of sealing up all entrances and exits.
Galvana: Seal up all the entrances and exits? That's a little extreme... I never thought you would advocate doing something like that. You really can't judge a book by its cover...
 About the searchlights...
Galvana: The searchlights seem to break frequently. It might be because of the energy storage devices installed inside them.
Galvana: Or maybe they break so often because people don't follow the instructions when they use them?
 Nothing.
Galvana: That's good then. Bye.
