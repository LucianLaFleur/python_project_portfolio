Dialogue[]

Rama: They're the same ingredients, but with the addition of spices, they become different!
 What are you selling?
Rama: They're seasonings used for cooking, popular in every household. The one I'd recommend the most is Spice!

Rama: Hahaha, I won! Ah, I'm not very good at the game, so it's nice to win once in a while.
(If the player wins the match)

Rama: Oh, I've heard about cheating with scents before... But rest assured, I would never do that.
 About spices...
Rama: Spices are essential for us Sumeru cooks!
Rama: As a vendor of everyday spices, I can't be more clear about this.
Rama: People buy more Spice from me than other seasonings combined together!
Rama: Even the most ordinary recipe can be given a new lease on life with the addition of Sumeru's unique Spice!
 That good, huh?
Rama: Of course!
Rama: Well, have a try and you'll know.
Rama: You can try it and see if it tastes much better than regular cheese.
(Obtain  Masala Cheese Balls ×3)
 See you.
Rama: You must try cooking with Spice!
