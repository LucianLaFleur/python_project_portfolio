Profile[]
Este was born in Remuria, serving the kingdom faithfully, gaining the title of 'Este the Quick-Witted' during his lifetime. Despite Remus' slumber, Este would not stray from the path of his Sebatos, actively trying to remind others of the God-King's teachings. However, when the kingdom fell, he would follow Cassiodor to Fontaine and start a family there.
Este's spirit — brought back by the Symphony — would eventually inhabit a Praetorian Golem as opposed to a resident of Petrichor, due to his descendant of the same name being present in the town.

Appearance[]
Este — due to the existence of his descendant during the events of Canticles of Harmony — is forced to inhabit a Praetorian Golem, lacking the orange in his helmet.
His appearance in life is unknown.
