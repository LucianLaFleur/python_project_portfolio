Profile[]
Nervous An is an overworked administrator for the Maritime Authority sector of the Ministry of Civil Affairs. He is also Linling's direct supervisor, a role he is not entirely pleased about due to her lack of vigilance in fulfilling her duties — thus causing them even more work when they have to go back and correct her mistakes.
When he finally has time off during the Lantern Rite event, he is visibly ecstatic over his five-day vacation.

Dialogue[]

Nervous An: Please retain a copy of your approved mooring license application form for your records... Hey! What are you doing!
 What are you up to?
Nervous An: I'm working, can't you see? I deal with all vessels entering and exiting the harbor, including mooring and customs procedures.
Nervous An: Please don't disturb me if you have no business here. The restricted goods approval form... Needs to be signed by a Millelith Sergeant...
 Didn't know talking to yourself counts as working.
Nervous An: ...Can you stop annoying me? I'm working out what I need to do next.
Nervous An: ...Aiya, now I've lost my brain of thought...
 I'll leave you to it. Bye.
Nervous An: *grunts*
Nervous An: Ah yes... And the potable water replenishment forms for all vessels need to be processed at the warehouse.

Event Dialogue[]
Lantern Rite[]

Nervous An: Hi! I'm the Manager of the Maritime Authority, and I'm in a fantastic mood right now!
Nervous An: Mmm, feel that sea breeze... Go on, close your eyes and feel it for a second... Do you feel it too?
Nervous An: ...Freedom! Hahahaha!
Nervous An: No more fishing boats and cargo ships trying to get in and out of the harbor; no more application forms and approval forms... For a few days, I can forget all about it!
Nervous An: Praise be to the Lord of Geo!

Moonlight Merriment[]

Nervous An: *sigh* And here I was thinking that I'd be able to take a break during the festival...
Nervous An: Instead, I've been working overtime due to the large increase in the demand for cooking ingredients...
Nervous An: Well, what can I say? I guess everyone here just loves to eat.

The Exquisite Night Chimes[]

(After completing A Thousand Miles for an Enigmatic Tune)
Nervous An: Entry registration forms for foreign ships, additional material requirements for stage construction, and... Wait, what are you doing!?

Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze[]

Nervous An: Hello there, friend. Have you decided on the sort of kites you'd like to make?
Nervous An: Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to pry. I just wanted to perhaps use your work as reference material.
Nervous An: I've been waiting for this holiday for so long, but now that it's here, I can't figure out which patterns I like...
Nervous An: I mean, there's no way I'll be sewing expired documents into a kite, surely?
Nervous An: I'm kidding. It's fine even if I don't have my own kite, really. It'll still be interesting watching others fly theirs.
