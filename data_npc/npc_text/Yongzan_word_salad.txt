Dialogue[]

Yongzan: Oh, will you look at the time? Dear me, we should be sipping tea and having dim sum right now!
 You are?
Yongzan: Me? I'm just an ordinary guard for hire.
Yongzan: If you're here for business, you can go talk to Han at the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency.
Yongzan: It's almost time for tea. What should I eat?
Yongzan: What do you think? Wait, you don't seem to be from around here. Never mind...
 How can you be so relaxed?
Yongzan: I just finished a job that took half a year, so I'm taking it easy right now.
Yongzan: It's different these days. The Communications Office doesn't want to see a monopoly, and they want all Secure Transport Agencies to have jobs.
Yongzan: I used to get ten or so big jobs in six months, but nowadays I only get about two. The other eight've gone to other agencies.
Yongzan: But that's fine with me. I can still enjoy life without those eight jobs, but some might starve if they don't get their share.
Yongzan: When I was still a rookie, no one looked after me. I'll just think of this as a favor for the Communications Office and for the young ones.
Yongzan: If I keep taking their jobs, I might feel bad when I get old, you know?
 Then I'll go "yum cha" too.
Yongzan: That sounds about right. Now get going.
