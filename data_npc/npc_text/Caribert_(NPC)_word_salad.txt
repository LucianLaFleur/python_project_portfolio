Profile[]
Caribert was a former resident of Khaenri'ah. His father was Chlothar and his mother was an unnamed woman with roots in Mondstadt. He was considered to be an "illegitimate son" by his father.[7]
After the gods attacked Khaenri'ah, they cursed its inhabitants, and the pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns were given immortality. Those who came to Khaenri'ah from the other gods' lands were instead cursed with the "wilderness", transforming them into hilichurls, Caribert included since his mother was from Mondstadt. Caribert fell into a state of torpor upon being transformed and was cared for by Chlothar.
Sometime after Khaenri'ah's fall, the Traveler's Sibling met Chlothar and Caribert. The former begged them for help in cultivating a forbidden medicine that would, according to records, awaken the God of Wisdom and help Caribert resist the effects of the curse. The sibling helped Chlothar make a dose and administered it to Caribert, but it had no effect. While trying to make a second dose, Chlothar saw a hilichurl he assumed was Caribert heading in the direction of The Chasm. The sibling and Chlothar followed it to a strange sanctuary, only to realize the hilichurl was not Caribert. However, deep within they would eventually meet the "Sinner," who imbued Chlothar with Abyssal power. The two eventually made their way out of the cavern and administered a second dose of the medication to Caribert.
Caribert regained his sentience but was initially horrified to see what he had become. Chlothar calmed him down and told him not to take his mask under any circumstances, which Caribert agreed to. However, when the sibling and Chlothar decided to go back to the sanctuary and find the deity, Caribert took off his mask and saw his reflection in a mirror. The mental anguish caused him to flee, and he was gone by the time Chlothar and the sibling returned. They eventually caught up to Caribert by the edge of a cliff, who took off his mask again and was enveloped by abyssal energies. 
Exactly what transpired after this is unclear, but Caribert died at the age of 8 while being used in the creation of the  Loom of Fate[8]. This allowed a fragment of his consciousness that remained within the Loom to control it in its incomplete state. He used the incomplete Loom to implant false memories into Dainsleif to aid the Abyss Order in their pursuit of the eye of the first Field Tiller, and also to interact with the inhabitants of Vimara Village, as he wished for the chance to know what his life could have been like; during this time, he became beloved by the villagers, who saw him as a kind and gentle person. He used the power of the nearly-completed Loom to implant the memory of a story meant to bring peace and quiet into the minds of hilichurls, and having fulfilled this goal, disappeared.

Appearance[]
Caribert shares the same appearance as a normal hilichurl, but with a silk scarf wrapped around his left wrist to allow Chlothar to easily identify him.
In his human form, his robes are similar in appearance to that of his father's. He has black hair, fair skin, and deep blue eyes that hold the same star-shaped irises as "pure-blood" Khaenri'ahns.[9] He also wears a diamond-shaped earring on his left ear. The silk scarf wrapped on his left wrist is present visible, and unfurls during a cutscene in World-Order Narration.
