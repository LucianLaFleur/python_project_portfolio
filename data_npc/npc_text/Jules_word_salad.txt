Dialogue[]

Jules: Hello there, friend... Uh, have we met before?
 Who are you?
Jules: Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm a fantasy novelist here in Petrichor hoping to get some inspiration from the place. You seemed so familiar that I almost thought you an editor intent on rushing me for a manuscript.
 It would seem that your writing isn't going too well...
Jules: Well, it wasn't, which was why I holed up in this little town, where most people wouldn't find me.
Jules: But I had a dream two days ago, one that had a grand, glorious ancient civilization as its stage — like an epic opera.
Jules: As such, I plan to write about a young adventurer who discovers an ancient underwater civilization while in pursuit of an enigmatic red gem.
Jules: Haha, perhaps we shall simply call it "The Ruby Riddle."
 Perhaps we met in a dream?
Jules: Haha, what an interesting way to put it! It seems you, too, have talent as an author.
Jules: Still, I do indeed believe that I met someone who looks much like you in a dream, which was why I thought you looked familiar...
Jules: The person I met in my dream was an incredible adventurer indeed. In fact, I'm going to use him as the protagonist in my new book!
 See you around.
Jules: See you, friend. Hmm. Just as I feel as if we've met before, perhaps we shall meet again sometime.
