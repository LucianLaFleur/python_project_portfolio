Qingye: I don't think this outfit I got fits me...
Hongyu: Who cares? I got a smelly one and you don't see me complaining!
Hongyu: Hurry up! Treasure Hoarder outfits are hard to come by, so don't be so picky!

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing The Dealing Sands.


Qingye: It's my first time doing something like this in someone else's clothes. It feels pretty good. I wouldn't mind doing it again...
Hongyu: Something like what? Is there something wrong with you in the head?
Hongyu: We only went undercover for a day, and you're addicted already...?
