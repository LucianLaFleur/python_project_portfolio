Haishan  (Chinese: 海山 Hǎishān) is the name of a sea monster slain by Beidou, with the help of The Crux fleet. It has been described as both a "hydra"[1] and a "leviathan," resembling both dragon and fish at once. After slaying Haishan, Beidou received her Electro Vision.[2]
Beidou's feat has become legendary among the citizens of Liyue, and even impressed the adeptus Xiao.[3] Tea Master Liu Su also recounts the tale through The Wrath of Haishan in the Commission Cliffhanger.

History[]
Haishan's age and origin is unknown, but it lived in Teyvat's oceans. It was said that all merchants and traders who sailed the ocean were bound to encounter Haishan at some point. As a child, Beidou loved hearing tales of sea monsters, and had dreamed of defeating Haishan ever since she was nine years old.[4]
After Beidou became captain of The Crux, she would run into Haishan many times, but never succeeded in killing the leviathan until one fateful day. As she and her crew sang a sea shanty about the monster to bolster themselves, the fleet attacked Haishan with cannons and harpoons. While Haishan was bound by the arrows and ropes, ensuring that it would not be able to escape easily, Beidou fought the monster with her best greatsword in hand. This battle raged fiercely for four days.[5]
The sailors were disadvantaged by their limited visibility at night, so they had to remain constantly vigilant against Haishan's attacks. On the last night, Beidou stood upon her ship's prow without eating or drinking, listening for Haishan's movements. When dawn broke, she heard a change in the sound of the waves, and beheaded the monster in a single lethal strike. A bolt of lightning struck the sea right in front of Beidou, and an Electro Vision descended out of the sky to her.[6]
