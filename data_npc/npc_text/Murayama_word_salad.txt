Profile[]
Murayama was part of a group of ronin who took over the Hidden Mountain Base of the Takatsukasa Clan, who abandoned their stronghold after their plot to take control of the Tenryou Commission from the Kujou Clan was exposed.[1] During the events of Ere the End, a Glance Back, Murayama and the other ronin are defeated by Kaedehara Kazuha in their Occupied Hold as a means for Kazuha to test the Prized Isshin Blade.

Appearance[]
Murayama is presumably the Kairagi: Dancing Thunder who appears near the end of the Occupied Hold. However, there is nothing explicitly identifying him as such.
