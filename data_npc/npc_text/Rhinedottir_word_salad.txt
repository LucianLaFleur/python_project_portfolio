Unborn life, unfulfilled wishes,Tragic dreams at the edge of the universal darkness that could never come true,Indwell my body, and descend unto this world.—Rhinedottir, in Durin's memories as narrated in Festering Desire
Rhinedottir is a proficient alchemist with mastery over the Art of Khemia, which was developed and practiced in Khaenri'ah. She is longtime friends with the adventurer Alice, though how they came to know each other or how long ago they met, given the longevity of Alice and Klee's race, is currently unknown.
After discovering the Heart of Naberius with Albedo, she disappeared without a trace. However, she left Albedo with a note, a recommendation letter, and a piece of classical text. She tasked Albedo with finding the "truth and meaning of this world" as his final assignment.[8]
Rhinedottir is known to Skirk, though she had only heard the name from her master Surtalogi. Skirk also remarked that like her master, Rhinedottir too is "pursuing some form of perfection". The exact relationship between Rhinedottir and Surtalogi is not known.

Story[]
Rhinedottir was an alchemist and researcher who attained the pinnacle of both knowledge and alchemical prowess, thus coming to be known as "Gold". She was particularly proficient in the Art of Khemia and created all sorts of living beings, which she classified under several categories, including the "Alfisol" (Riftwolves), "Humus" (Durin), and "Cretaceus" (Albedo).
At some point, Rhinedottir created the dragon Durin, which she considered her masterpiece at the time.[citation needed] She also created many failed subjects, which she discarded, as part of her Primordial Human Project, intended to create humans through alchemy. One such failure was Primordial Albedo, which she left within Durin's stomach.[9]

The Cataclysm[]
See also: Cataclysm § The Cataclysm in Teyvat
Five hundred years before the start of the game, a great disaster ravaged all of Teyvat around the same time that Khaenri'ah fell. Because of conflicting information given, it is currently uncertain whether Rhinedottir's creatures traveled to Teyvat first, thus attracting the attention of the gods in Celestia and The Seven which resulted in Khaenri'ah's destruction, or if Khaenri'ah's destruction at their hands caused Rhinedottir to send her creations to Teyvat. Nonetheless, she is considered one of the Five Sinners of Khaenri'ah.
From the perspective of the people of Teyvat, the fall of Khaenri'ah's Eclipse Dynasty set off a chain of disasters. Among them was the army of "shadowy monsters" created by "Gold," which then invaded Teyvat.[10] A contrasting perspective given by Durin's memories instead claim that Rhinedottir had sent him away from Khaenri'ah to "display [his] beauty,"[11] with any nefarious intentions left ambiguous, while the Riftwolves invaded Teyvat of their own volition.[12] It unknown whether she is aware of the havoc her creations caused.
Notably, both Dainsleif and Pierro, who are survivors from Khaenri'ah, have indicated that multiple figures from their nation were responsible for invoking Celestia's wrath. Nevertheless, the role the Art of Khemia played in Khaenri'ah's downfall has put both Dainsleif and Venti on guard against it.[13][14]

After the Cataclysm[]
Rhinedottir apparently emerged relatively unscathed from the cataclysm.[citation needed] She eventually made a breakthrough in her Primordial Human Project and created the "perfect" Albedo, which she classified as "Cretaceus," and taught him everything she knew as they ventured in and out of domains. One day, they stumbled upon an item known as the Heart of Naberius. Shortly afterwards, Rhinedottir disappeared, leaving Albedo with the task of discovering the "truth and meaning of this world" and directing him to seek out help from Alice in Mondstadt.

Trivia[]
In the original release version of Breeze Amidst the Forest before update 1.2, Gold was referred to with (generic) male pronouns. After the release of The Chalk Prince and the Dragon event with Version 1.2, the text was updated with Gold's pronouns explicitly changed to be gender-neutral, as to not cause any confusion in regards to their unconfirmed sex.
The English version of Breeze Amidst the Forest characterizes Gold as "corrupted by their own greed and ambition." However, the equivalent sentence in the original Chinese text simply says that Gold was a "sinner."
In the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean versions, "Gold" is specified by a noun that means the metal "gold" in the respective language, rather than the transcription of the European surname "Gold."
In the Chinese version of The Snowy Past, Albedo calls her "Gold" Rhinedottir (Chinese: 「黄金」莱茵多特), indicating that "Gold" is a title.
In Dainsleif's character introduction, a "self-proclaimed prophet" says "Chalk pursues gold, in this time inopportune, the eclipse is swallowed by the crimson moon,"[16] which may be an allusion to Albedo, Rhinedottir, Khaenri'ah, and the cataclysm respectively.
"Chalk pursues gold" may be a metaphor for how Albedo, the Chalk Prince, hopes to reunite with Rhinedottir, who holds the title of "Gold," by completing his final assignment.
Alternatively, "Chalk pursues gold" could instead be a metaphor for how Albedo is pursuing alchemical perfection in himself. His final assignment may be to achieve citrinitas (the yellowing) himself, i.e. achieving "enlightenment" through learning for himself the truth and meaning of the world.
The final ruling dynasty of Khaenri'ah was the Eclipse Dynasty, while the visage of a crimson moon has been connected to the cataclysm — specifically, Celestia's role in Khaenri'ah's destruction.
Additionally, eclipse, chalk, crimson, and gold represent the four stages of the Magnum Opus of alchemy, each of which are represented by a color: nigredo (black), albedo (white), rubedo (red), citrinitas (yellow/gold).
Materials about classical alchemy differ on the order of citrinitas and rubedo. As far as Khaenri'ah is concerned, citrinitas (yellow) comes after rubedo (red), as mentioned in Albedo's Feelings About Ascension. The Narzissenkreuz Ordo disagrees with this, claiming "Yellow is simply bait. Red is the final goal."[17]
Furthermore, in historical accounts, after the 15th century, many writers tended to compress citrinitas into rubedo and consider only three stages. This may be parallel to some in-game mystic beliefs.
Rhinedottir wrote Vol. 3 of The Little Witch and the Undying Fire.
Though it is unknown when exactly the book collection was written, the authors' notes state that Rhinedottir was in a lucid state of mind when she wrote Vol. 3, and that it was rare for her to be in her right mind.
Etymology[]
Rhinedottir  (Icelandic: Rhinedóttir) means "daughter of Rhine" in Icelandic and Old Norse and may be a reference to the Rhinemaidens. The Rhinemaidens, also known as Rheintöchter or Rhine daughters, are the keepers of the Rhinegold in Richard Wagner's opera cycle, Der Ring des Nibelungen.
