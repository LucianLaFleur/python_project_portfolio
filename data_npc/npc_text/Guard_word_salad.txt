Guard: Hey! Stop right there! No one is allowed to enter or leave Sumeru City right now. Go away!
Paimon: Whoa... Ugh, okay.

Attempting to teleport away or bypass the guards will give the warning "Note that leaving this area will affect your current story experience. This may affect your current quest progress." After confirming, the story progress is rolled back and the player has to restart the relevant quest.
