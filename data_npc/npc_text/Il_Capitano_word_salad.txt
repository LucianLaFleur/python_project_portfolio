Profile[]
Capitano enjoys a high reputation amongst the Fatui, with Viktor stating that if he had the choice, he would rather work under Capitano.[6] He is also extremely powerful, though he uses his power with responsibility.
Wanderer, however, views such attribute negatively and points out that holding "absolute righteousness" is a potential hazard.[7]

Appearance[]
Capitano has glowing dark blue eyes.[8] Out of all of the confirmed Harbingers, he is the only one whose entire head is concealed. He also seem's to be having Black hair. In The Lazzo trailer, he seems to be wearing an double-breasted white overcoat with grey lapels and a collar of black fur. Just like the rest of the harbingers.

Story[]
During Varka's expedition when Mika was accompanying them, the knights accidentally ran into several Fatui scouts, resulting in a tense situation where Capitano was eventually alerted of the situation alongside Varka. The two eventually met and agreed to peacefully depart, with Varka stating that he would have loved to duel him under different circumstances.[8]
After Signora's death at the hands of the Raiden Shogun, a funeral for her was held in Snezhnaya. Capitano, along with the other Harbingers barring Scaramouche, was in attendance, where he questioned Il Dottore on the situation with Scaramouche and the Electro Gnosis.

In-Game[]
During the event of Of Ballads and Brews, Varka's letter to the Knights of Favonius revealed that he and his expedition encountered Il Capitano. Despite the Fatui's previous transgressions against Mondstadt during the events of the Archon Quest Prologue, the two sides remained cordial to each other, and some of Capitano's actions actually helped the expedition. At the time Varka wrote his letter, Capitano had just left for Natlan.[9]
After Fontaine's prophecy was averted, Neuvillette informs the Traveler that Capitano had joined the conflicts occurring in Natlan, having learnt this information through his dealings with Arlecchino.[5]

I've always had that kind of attitude, but it wasn't until I was on the expedition that I realized how serious things can become... One day, I met the Fatui Harbinger known as The Captain. I can't even begin to imagine how I can deal with an opponent like him. I just... Such powerful people are really on a level of their own, I'm not even remotely close...TartagliaAbout The Captain Media:VO_Tartaglia About The Captain.ogg Media:VO ZH_Tartaglia About The Captain.ogg Media:VO JA_Tartaglia About The Captain.ogg Media:VO KO_Tartaglia About The Captain.ogg I've seen him in battle before, and oh what a sight it was. Perhaps I'm ranked too low for him to notice me right now. Well, he may not recognize my strengths yet, but one day, I'll show him what I'm made of.WandererAbout The Captain Media:VO_Wanderer About The Captain.ogg Media:VO ZH_Wanderer About The Captain.ogg Media:VO JA_Wanderer About The Captain.ogg Media:VO KO_Wanderer About The Captain.ogg "The ever-righteous Captain," "the brave and fearless Captain," "the nigh-invincible Captain"... Even my mechanical ears demand maintenance after listening to so many compliments from the members of the Fatui. Don't you think that possessing absolute righteousness is actually a latent danger? And that's without taking his great personal strength into account.

Notes[]

↑ As only the First and Tenth of the Fatui Harbingers have not been identified, Il Capitano is very likely to be the First of the Fatui Harbingers due to the voice-lines from Arlecchino, Wanderer and Tartaglia talking about the Harbingers in order of their rank, of which his is above Dottore's. However, Capitano's rank will be left unknown until it is officially confirmed.
