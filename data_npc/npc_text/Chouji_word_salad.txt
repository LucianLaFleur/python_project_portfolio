Profile[]
Chouji and his parents lived in Higi Village until the Tatarigami began making villagers on the island ill. His mother was infected with the energy, but unlike many other villagers who succumbed to madness, was apparently unaffected. Regardless, she was still inflicted with fever and bleeding, and departed to Sumeru with a crew of pirates for treatment.[2] Although she left the Unsealed Letter for him informing him of the reason for her departure, it was found and opened by an unidentified figure and left in Jakotsu Mine.[1]
Chouji would live by himself, seemingly unaffected by the Tatarigami, and believed that his parents were not affected by it. Since then, Chouji has been trying to save up Mora by selling Crystal Marrow in order to leave Yashiori Island and search for his parents.[3] While Chouji's mother wrote to "Uncle" Onitaka and his pirate crew to take care of her son while she was gone, Onitaka's crew did not arrive to pick him up, as they succumbed to the Tatarigami and would not bring him in until they dealt with the samurai on the broken boat.[4]
Sometime later, Chouji met the Traveler and asked them to bring him Crystal Marrow for reasons yet unknown. The Traveler and Paimon became suspicious and began asking him why he needed it, as it was being monopolized by the Shogunate. Chouji then admitted that he was looking for his parents, and seeing this, the Traveler and Paimon began helping him acquire Crystal Marrow, and he was eventually able to leave Yashiori Island, eventually departing for Snezhnaya to look for his mother.
According to the Puppy Union Admission Details that Heizou had given to the Traveler during the event Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness, it was revealed that Chouji was one of the many people who were rescued from the warzone, with his codename being Weasel Thief No. 12. He was 8 years old during the events of that war.[5]

Trivia[]
Yasumoto said he would take care of Chouji after "it was all over," however disappeared due to the player's involvement in helping him find a cure.
It is heavily implied in the Pirate's Diaries that Chouji's father was not killed, but rather ended up with the very same pirates that Chouji's mother eventually left for Sumeru with. However, despite the pirates offering to help him find his wife and son, he declined and left.
This means that Chouji's father is still implied to be in Inazuma, Chouji's mother is on her way to Sumeru, and Chouji himself is headed for Snezhnaya.
