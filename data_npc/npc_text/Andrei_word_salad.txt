Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Andrei: Welcome! How may I assist you today?
 Who are you?
Andrei: I am the account manager here at the Northland Bank. Feel free to find me for help with any matters you'd like to take care of in the bank.
Andrei: If you're interested in a loan, I can assure you that our interest rates are better than any of the local lenders you'll find around Liyue.
Andrei: You'll also find our savings accounts much more competitive as well. Our interest return on savings will surely be higher than any local lender!
Andrei: So no matter what your business may be, Northland Bank can always be the first to meet your banking needs!
 Tell me about the Northland Bank.
Andrei: This is actually a Snezhnayan bank that was opened here in Liyue Harbor. The building itself was constructed in accordance with the local Liyue style.
Andrei: However, many Liyue locals still seem to harbor some resentment towards our bank. They think that our presence here may be damaging the Liyue economy.
Andrei: But this clearly can be an opportunity that benefits everyone. As long as we can be fully integrated into the marketplace, the economy will only continue to grow more.
Andrei: As for our own nation's economy, we have the brilliance and foresight of Master Pantalone to thank.
Andrei: Oh, and we mustn't forget Her Majesty the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya.
 Goodbye.
Andrei: We look forward to your next visit with us. Please find me for any business matters that require assistance.

Nighttime[]

Andrei: Welcome! How may I assist you to...
Andrei: Oh wait, I'm already off the clock now. What's the matter?
 What are you doing?
Andrei: I'm sure you've been enjoying all that Liyue Harbor has to offer?
Andrei: As a native of Snezhnaya, I was initially quite reluctant about being transferred to Liyue by the Northland Bank.
Andrei: But as I came to understand more about Liyue, I found myself liking it more and more.
Andrei: Things like the sea here and the city's atmosphere are all quite different from my home, haha!
 Tell me about your home.
Andrei: My hometown is not quite as lively as the bustling city of Liyue...
Andrei: And I've completely fallen in love with the food in Liyue. With such a variety of colors, flavors, and aromas, the cuisine here is simply exquisite!
Andrei: But even so, I could never turn my back on Her Majesty the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya.
 Goodbye.
Andrei: Goodbye...
Andrei: Ah, seeing as I still have to work tomorrow, I'll need to take the chance now to relax.
