Dialogue[]

Enteka: Welcome. A good cup of coffee will keep you energized all day.
 What have you got here?
Enteka: Are you found of desserts? We have some that go very well with coffee. Please, feel free to try some!
(Opens the Puspa Café Shop menu)
 What is this place?
Enteka: This is Puspa Café, and I'm the acting manager here.
Enteka: If you're a first-time customer, why don't you tell me what your preferences are? Then I can recommend a coffee that will suit your tastes.
Enteka: Do you like your coffee sweet, or do you prefer it more on the bitter side? Stronger or milder?
Enteka: Whatever your preferences, no matter how offbeat, I can make something to your liking.
 About that cat...
Enteka: Ah, you must have spotted Gata.
Enteka: Gata's not even a year old yet so she's still a very curious kitty. Whenever I read people's fortunes from the coffee grounds, she'll jump up to watch.
Enteka: If you'd like, you can give her head a good pat. She'll get happy and start purring, and you'll get to enjoy the softest feeling in the world.
 Yay, woohoo!
Enteka: Haha, looks like you are a cat lover, too.
Enteka: Here's a tip for you, my friend! Gata prefers Fowl to Fish.
Enteka: If Gata eats the Fowl you feed her, then she must be willing to be your friend!
(Obtain  Fowl ×4)
 See you.
Enteka: Take care, hope to see you again.
