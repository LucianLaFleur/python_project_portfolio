Ferigees is a quest-exclusive NPC who appears in the World Quest Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part III in Series The Dirge of Bilqis.
Originally a Jinni who served Nabu Malikata, she switched allegiances to King Deshret after her mistress' death and chose to house her soul inside a machine on top of Deshret's Glass Goblet to safeguard the Orchard of Pairidaeza, where Nabu Malikata is said to have been laid to rest.

Profile[]
Ferigees was one of the Jinn who served Nabu Malikata, the Goddess of Flowers. After her death, King Deshret promised to build a mausoleum for her, and the Jinn chose to serve him. Ferigees originally dwelled in Ay-Khanoum,[1] but realized that Liloupar's machinations spelled doom for Gurabad, where Nabu Malikata was laid to rest in the Orchard of Pairidaeza, or Eternal Oasis. To protect both the mortals and her mistress' slumber, Ferigees chose to sacrifice her Jinn body and indwell a machine.[1][2][3]
While searching for the Orchard of Pairidaeza, the Traveler, Paimon, and Liloupar — who was sealed inside a bottle and fragmented as punishment by King Deshret for masterminding the downfall of Gurabad thousands of years earlier — confront Ferigees. Ferigees considers Liloupar a traitor while Liloupar deems Ferigees' current state to be pitiable, culminating in a battle between the Traveler and the automatons summoned by Ferigees. The fight ends with the destruction of Ferigees' mechanical husk, spelling her doom. She spends her final moments rebuking Liloupar, warning her that the "Eternal Oasis" is empty when Liloupar reveals she believed Nabu Malikata was slumbering there.[4]

Appearance[]
Because Ferigees shed her Jinni body thousands of years ago, her original appearance is unknown. In the present, she appears as two orbs floating inside the machine housing her spirit.

Trivia[]
In the original Chinese text, when Liloupar refers to Ferigees as "sister," she uses 姐妹 jiěmèi, a term which is typically used for a person whom the speaker is not familially related to. That said, Paimon and the Traveler sardonically remark on their similar manners of speech being an indication of a familial relation, and there is insufficient information about Jinn to say whether the two are "family" from a human perspective.
Etymology[]
In the Iranian epic Shahnameh, Ferigees is the wife of Siyâvash and mother of Kay Khosrow.
