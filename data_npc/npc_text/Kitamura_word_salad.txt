Profile[]
Kitamura was one of the soldiers of the Inazuma Shogunate who perished during the cataclysm 500 years ago.
When the rifthounds began attacking the roots of the Sacred Sakura, Kitamura's memories manifested in front of the Traveler and Raiden Ei when they arrived at Araumi. Noticing the Traveler, he warned them to leave for their own safety due to the monsters roaming Inazuma and killing all in their path. Ei then joined in on the conversation, surprising him. She explained to him that Inazuma had changed and was not what he had seen back then, upon which he realized that the Shogun had eventually returned and saved Inazuma, moving on peacefully.

Appearance[]
Kitamura wears a standard uniform modeled from the ashigaru (Japanese: 足軽) of feudal Japan. He wears a purple-gray shitagi, gray kobakama, white socks, and waraji sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with gray accents consists of dou (breastplate) with the Inazuma Shogunate's crest, han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves). He is also wearing a jingasa (Japanese: 陣笠) with the crest of the Inazuma Shogunate.
