Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Scenes from Life in Meropide: Every Debt has a Creditor.


Galvaryet: The next time Sis has time off... Sorry, I was daydreaming. Do you need something?
 About the pipes...
Galvaryet: Oh, that's all too complicated for me... But I know the pipes are extremely long and keep my sister far away from me. I wish they didn't exist.
 About the loudspeaker...
Galvaryet: It has helped us save drinking water... But more and more people are using it to play pranks, including some of the guards. We need to think of a way to stop that...
 Someone who looks just like you...
Galvaryet: You didn't cause any problems and just leave them for Sis to fix, did you? If you did, and she has to do overtime because of you... Then I'll keep her company.
 Nothing.
Galvaryet: Okay, nothing is a good thing.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Scenes from Life in Meropide: Every Debt has a Creditor.


Galvaryet: Oh, it's you. What's up?
 About a guard's duties...
Galvaryet: The bulk of my time is spent dealing with trivial little matters. But not having bigger problems means everything is running smoothly, right?
 About Galvana...
Galvaryet: I feel like Sis and I have been drifting apart lately... but why? We used to be so close. Surely nobody is trying to separate us...
 About Clynes...
Galvaryet: He's one of those weirdos people often talk about. It's obvious he could leave and get a job, but it's impossible to persuade him to go.
Galvaryet: It's good that he's able to help us by fixing things. But I always suspect he's up to no good and secretly making more work for us...
 Nothing.
Galvaryet: Okay, nothing is a good thing.
