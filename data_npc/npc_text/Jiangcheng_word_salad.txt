 I wonder if...
Media:VO Jiangcheng 01.ogg "Hmm. Wonder if it will be a good harvest this year."

Dialogue[]

Jiangcheng: *sigh* I haven't been out in the fields for a while now. I wonder how the harvest is going...
Jiangcheng: Wife... Wife?
 Errr, hello?
Jiangcheng: Ah, wife, you're here.
Jiangcheng: You were just on my mind... You've been saying that our daughter is of marriageable age now, have you not?
Jiangcheng: Ah, we can't simply leave her with those layabout thugs, can we...
Jiangcheng: But still, if she's got her eye on someone, we should advise her a little...
 I think you've got the wrong person...

Jiangcheng: Then our daughter... and you, wife, we would be...
 ...Um, bye.
Jiangcheng: Ah, sure. Wife... don't forget to look after our land...
