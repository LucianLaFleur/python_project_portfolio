 Free coffee...
Media:VO Gontharet 01.ogg "*sigh* Looks like no more free coffee for me."

Dialogue[]

Gontharet: *sigh* What are we going to do about this?
 What's the matter?
Gontharet: There's something terribly wrong in Fontaine, that's what! Something's got to change, and we're all responsible for making that happen! We have to band together and fight for our rights!
 What are you talking about, anyway?
Gontharet: Fontaine, of course, Fontaine! The Palais Mermonia, our energy situation, our top-down system... We have so many problems here. Can't you see?
Gontharet: I've spoken to Arouet about them many times, and he agrees with my points — why, he's even treated me to coffee several times!
Gontharet: It's just that... Well, that hasn't worked as well recently. He says that my opinions don't attract him the way they used to.
 Not working?
Gontharet: Work? Why, I'm doing something far more important than work!
Gontharet: Those who always work and work will find themselves little different from clockwork machines. It is only through constant questioning and asking that we can forge a new path!
Gontharet: Our history and present are all proof of this.
Gontharet: If you do not mind treating me to a cup of coffee, we can continue this line of conversation.
 See you.
Gontharet: ...Wait, you're leaving already?
