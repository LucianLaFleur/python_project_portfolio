 How long...
Media:VO Zadra 01.ogg "How long will it take if I set out from here?"

Dialogue[]

Zadra: It will take only one hour to walk around this place. The time left can be used to...
 Hey, are you...
Zadra: Oh, hey there. I'm planning my itinerary.
Zadra: Before I arrived in Fontaine, I did have a plan ready. But I just met a nice person named Cheriez, and it seems that I'll now have to make some adjustments.
Zadra: You see, there's an art to even setting up a tour itinerary. It must be fresh and innovative, but it also needs to be rigorously managed, and you need to adapt to the situation on the ground.
Zadra: Now that I think about it, even filling out a form has gained an element of fun...
 I shan't bother you further, then.
Zadra: It's no issue. I was just studying my travel plans, that's all.
