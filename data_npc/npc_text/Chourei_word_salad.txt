 Duel
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Chourei: Umm... How exactly did I win again?
(If the player wins the match)

Chourei: Uhh... How did I lose so suddenly?
 What are you doing?
Chourei: Hm? I'm here to maintain order at the port.
Chourei: To be honest, this port is very safe, and there aren't many issues. The most dangerous thing that has happened so far was a dispute between the captains of two cargo ships about who should enter the port first.
Chourei: One of the captains let their emotions get the better of them, and jumped directly from their own ship's mast to confront the other captain.
Chourei: Needless to say, everyone was pretty startled, and in the end, Ms. Cassigneul herself had to step in to mediate.
Chourei: You should've seen how far that captain leaped. Are all sailors that strong?
 What exactly were they delivering...?
Chourei: I remember one of the ships was a tea clipper from Liyue, and the other was carrying spices from Sumeru.
Chourei: Speaking of tea, I've heard that there's a delicacy in Liyue where they boil a bird's egg and then crack part of the shell.
Chourei: Once they've done that, they soak it in tea along with various seasonings. The egg absorbs the aroma of the tea and produces a unique and layered flavor.
Chourei: I wonder if there are any clever minds in Fontaine that can replicate this delicacy. I'd really like to taste it.
 Goodbye.
Chourei: Goodbye, and I wish you peaceful days ahead.
