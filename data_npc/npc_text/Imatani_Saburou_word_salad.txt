Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Dreamlike Timelessness.


Imatani Saburou: Hello, are you here to visit our village?
 Hello.
Imatani Saburou: You must be an outlander, right? An outlander is a guest here. If you are not in a hurry, why don't you come on in, drink some tea, and take a break?
Imatani Saburou: Konda Village is a very nice place. Its environment is beautiful and quiet. It's a very suitable place to reside.
Imatani Saburou: My wife and I have been living here for decades. I still like this place.
 It is indeed a fine place.
Imatani Saburou: Indeed. When she and I traveled here for the first time, we knew that we would settle down here.
Imatani Saburou: We plant fruits, grow flowers, and weave. It's a peaceful life, yet it is not boring at all. Once we had some children, it got even more bustling.
Imatani Saburou: It sounds a bit too carefree, right? But it's not a bad thing to be carefree. You don't have to live a busy life traveling around to have a fulfilling life.
 Have you heard of any weird happenings recently?
Imatani Saburou: I remember hearing some talk about some urban legends, but I've never been a fan of these topics, so I don't really know anything useful.
Imatani Saburou: Well, it's not always a good thing to know more. The more news you hear, the more bothered you will be. After a while, even a happy life will be beyond your reach.
 Goodbye.
Imatani Saburou: Come back soon. This is a good place.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Dreamlike Timelessness.


Imatani Saburou: Hey, aren't you Yoimiya's friend? Come on in!
 I'm here to visit you.
Imatani Saburou: Thank you. I didn't expect you to still remember me.
Imatani Saburou: I still have some snacks available at home, so let's dig in. They were sent by Yoimiya.
Imatani Saburou: There's just too much. My wife and I can't finish them all.
 How is Keisuke doing?
Imatani Saburou: He came home once. He told us that he finally resolved his differences with Sakujirou. As for how it got resolved and where Sakujirou went, he didn't tell me.
Imatani Saburou: But as long as the matter is settled, I'm fine with it. My wife and I are happy for him.
Imatani Saburou: Many lost things can be retrieved, but you can only have so many childhood friends. There's no getting them back once you've lost them.
 Goodbye.
Take care. Stay happy.
