Dialogue[]

Farooq: Watch out for pickpockets.
 Are there lots of thieves?
Farooq: With the Corps of Thirty around, pickpockets wouldn't dare come around often.
Farooq: But there could be "inside jobs."
Farooq: If you see someone who looks exactly like me, watch your wallet.
Farooq: He's my twin brother. A petty thief who talks nonsense all the time.
Farooq: Don't let him rub off on you. Just keep an eye on his actions.
 You all look pretty much the same...
Farooq: That's even easier: Don't trust anyone.
Farooq: You'll pay the price someday if you let your guard down around people in uniforms.
(Obtain  Adventurer's Experience ×4)
 Thanks for the reminder.
Farooq: Good to hear that.
