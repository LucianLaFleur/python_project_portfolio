The book says that the craftsman "Aberaku no Mikoto" was ordered to create the chariot of the sun to finally bring light to the everlasting night.—Enjou, "The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent"
Aberaku no Mikoto, also known as Abrax, was a historical figure who lived in Enkanomiya. He was the creator of the Dainichi Mikoshi, the artificial sun that saved the nation from the threat of the Bathysmal Vishaps. After his death, his emotions and memories were preserved as a Sinshade.

See also: Dainichi Mikoshi § Lore
Aberaku was recognized as a sage who was enlightened by the Tokoyo Ookami during the "Year of Blindness" in Enkanomiya's history and discovered a method to bring light to the lightless nation, which led him to create the tower Helios, later known as the Dainichi Mikoshi. The second year after Helios was completed, Aberaku was imprisoned by the Sunchild, the figure who had been appointed ruler over Enkanomiya. By the tenth year after Helios' completion, Aberaku was "long gone."[1]
After his death, his memories were preserved in the ley lines, leading him to manifest as a Shade of Tokoyo.

Appearance[]
Like most shades, he is a translucent humanoid figure without defining physical features.

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
Abrax is likely derived from Abraxas, a term and figure among the Basilideans, a Gnostic sect. Abraxas' actual role and the meaning of his name are unclear, as most sources about Abraxas' role are not derived from Basilides' teachings; however, it is generally believed that Abraxas is the "great archon" and the ruler of the 365 heavens.
