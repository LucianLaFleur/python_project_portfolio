Profile[]
Shalmar is Banu's father, the writer of  50 Things Every Traveling Scholar Should Know and a Spantamad researcher. He created the game of looking for Future Stars to form fun memories for his daughter.  He used Parvo Cores and an Ayesha's Chaos Prospector, old items that the Akademiya intended to get rid of, as materials for a treasure hunting game. He personally buried the cores, renamed them as Future Stars and had his daughter enjoy the  game.[1] As a reward, he gave his daughter a Starconch and called it the Great Future Star that will allow Banu to listen to the stars.
As an academic, he is very knowledgeable with the Ley Lines and mechanics, and capable of manipulating mechanisms in Sumeru. For example, he manipulated an old Ayesha's Chaos Prospector into Banu's Wisdom. However, as a father, he is incompetent leaving all of the housework and cooking to Banu.[1]
