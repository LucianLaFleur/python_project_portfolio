Dialogue[]

Baiji: When I first saw you, I thought that you must be some sort of local adeptus. Sorry about that, really...
Siora: It's fine. The adepti in the legends you told me about seem really amazing! It is my honor to have been considered one of them.
Baiji: Hehe, all's well so long as you don't mind. I'd be real saddened if someone as small and cute as you were to dislike me.
Siora: Well, I do look quite small, sure, but I'm at least a few hundred years old.
Baiji: Eh!?
Siora: Hehe, this must be your first time in Fontaine, right? Do you need me to introduce you to some local habits and customs?
Siora: Consider it thanks for telling me stories of Liyue.
Baiji: W—Would you really? Thank you, Melu... sine? Is that how you pronounce that?
Siora: Yup, your pronunciation's great! Well, then, let's start.
