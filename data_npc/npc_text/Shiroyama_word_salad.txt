Shiroyama (Japanese: 城山 Shiroyama) was a former member of the Police Station and an important figure in Ryuuji's case several years ago, which ended in the murder of Takatsukasa Isamu. While Ryuuji was originally scapegoated for the murder, Sango and Shikanoin Heizou correctly identified Shiroyama as the true murderer. Shiroyama was pressured into committing suicide to hide the circumstances behind Takatsukasa's death.[1]
