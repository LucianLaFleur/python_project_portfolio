Flash-Fist Ling's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Flash-Fist Ling is training under the Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz, oblivious to the old man's obvious scam. When spoken to, he "demonstrates" a technique of The Way (the "martial art" he is studying) called the Dance of the Frenzied Turtle, which allegedly has his fists moving so fast that you can't see them move. However, this is naturally a lie, though Flash-Fist Ling is so deep into his sunken cost fallacy that he continues to believe that he is a martial arts expert.

Dialogue[]

Flash-Fist Ling: Bear witness to my fists!
 What fighting style is that?
Flash-Fist Ling: "Of all the martial faculties in the world, speed reigns supreme"!
Flash-Fist Ling: Do you not know? This is called the Dance of the Frenzied Turtle!
Flash-Fist Ling: Check it out — was that fast or what!?
 I didn't see anything...
Flash-Fist Ling: Hmph, your mind can't believe your eyes, that's all!
Flash-Fist Ling: The reason you didn't see it is that I was too fast for you! Now is that fast or what!?
 Does this have any practical applications?
Flash-Fist Ling: Whether it does or not, it is right to practice it! I am not merely learning a martial art form — I am heeding divine guidance in pursuit of the Way!
Flash-Fist Ling: All in all, I've spent tens of thousands of Mora on this! As long as I practice it, it'll all be worth it. Right!?
 ...Bye.
Flash-Fist Ling: Goodbye.
Flash-Fist Ling: *Haiii-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!*
