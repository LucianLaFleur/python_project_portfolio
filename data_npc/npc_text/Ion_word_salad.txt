Ion's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Here lies Ion no Mikoto, versed in fortune-telling and sigil-signs, but who often predicted falsely, never errant only when reading the span of his own years.—The Royal Tomb of Ion
Though his tombstone says otherwise, Ion claims that he has never missed a read on someone's fortune. Instead, he will deliberately tell those who do not have happy fates that their luck will turn, in the hopes they will have a happier time. He does admit that generally his readings are not exactly correct, but it is unusual for him to fail to get a reading at all — thus his inability to read Paimon's fortune he considers a challenge to further his studies.[1]

Appearance[]
Like the other child Shades of Tokoyo, he is a translucent childlike figure without defining physical features.

Etymology[]
Ion is likely named after Ion, one of the sons of the Greek sun god Apollo.
The mythological Ion was raised by a priestess of the Delphic Oracle, and similarly Ion is associated with fortune-reading.
