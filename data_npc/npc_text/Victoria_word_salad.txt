Profile[]
Victoria listens to confessions all day and, when necessary, gives some guidance — and not always the welcome kind. She tends to be hypervigilant, growing hostile towards Albert for constantly hanging around the Cathedral (unaware that he is a fan of Barbara's), despite lacking any proof that he was up to anything malicious.[3]
Victoria also has an uncanny obsession with "sinners," particularly those who come to seek the gods' forgiveness yet do not put in any effort to change, or those who refuse to see the errors of their ways.
For example, she keeps a close eye on Nimrod due to his alcoholism. If the Traveler presents her with Nimrod's hefty drinking bill, she claims that people will not remember the consequences of their actions until they "really had to suffer for it," and decides to enact some "payback." However, if the Traveler finds no evidence of Nimrod drinking, Victoria proves herself much more lenient and is willing to consider the lack of evidence as proof that he has changed.[4]

Appearance[]
Victoria dresses in a black and white nun attire and wears a white hat.

Dialogue[]

Victoria: Can I help? Have you come to confess, my child?
 About Stormterror...
(After completing A Long Shot)
Victoria: Ever since Stormterror appeared, there have been many more people coming to confession. This is an unexpected boon.
Victoria: But it matters little. Even if Stormterror hadn't arrived, I have ways and means of making people confess... of their own accord...
Victoria: In a manner of speaking, of course. Don't think about it too much. *chuckles*
 What are you doing?
Victoria: I am Victoria from the church.
Victoria: I listen to confessions and, when necessary, give some guidance.
Victoria: All kinds of spiritually edifying... guidance.
 Is there anywhere good to go in Mondstadt?
Victoria: My child, I sense that whatever grave sin you carry with you is weighing heavily on your heart... The best place for you now is surely the confessional?
Victoria: ...Heh. Just kidding, I say that to everyone.
Victoria: But please do not come to me with such trivial questions next time.
 Surely it isn't as simple as that...
Victoria: Hmph. Sharp people always make enemies of others.
Victoria: Some people were born in the sun, and thus take light and warmth for granted.
Victoria: But love, piety, holiness... all these wonderful things were built on the blood and tears of sinners.
Victoria: Can you all not see it, or do you just look away?
Victoria: If that's the case, then don't ask or think about it too much. When sin comes knocking, judgement will soon follow.
Victoria: Take what I've said as a warning. Take this with you, too. I hope it will keep you vigilant.
(Obtain 4★  Bloodstained Chevalier's Goblet)
 Goodbye.
Victoria: Goodbye.
Victoria: When you are ready to repent, come and find me!

What a nuisance.
