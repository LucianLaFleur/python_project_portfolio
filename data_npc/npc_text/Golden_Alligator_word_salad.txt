Profile[]
Golden Alligator is the leader of a small group of Treasure Hoarders. He and his crew were searching for treasure when they were interrupted by Beidou and the Traveler. Fearful of Beidou, he and his men tried to flee, but she stopped them and allowed them to claim the treasure as they found it first. He chose to give it to her, who in turn would use her connections to help him and his men find honest jobs around Liyue Harbor before allowing the group to leave.
As they walked around, he and his men, left impressed by Beidou's values, decided to accept her offer and helped them find the treasure, which was revealed to be a check for Northland Bank, some Sakura Blooms and a letter from a son to his mother. Beidou then had Golden Alligator and his men deliver the contents to the son's mother, Minamoto Kotomi.
