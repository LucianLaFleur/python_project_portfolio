Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventure[]

Phonia: Honorary Knight, and The Helper in White. Phonia of the Investigation Team, reporting. We're currently carrying out an urgent mission: Annihilate the Invasive Anglers. I am in charge of acoustic recon.
Phonia: If you have any questions, there is a knight called Ematol by the lake. She's better at interpersonal communication and can provide you with detailed information.
 I haven't asked anything yet...
Paimon: R—Right! We just wanted to greet you, and you just started babbling on...
Paimon: (Feels like she's a bit impatient...)
Phonia: Isn't that a good thing? We all work for the Knights of Favonius, and we're all on the clock right now, so we should not indulge ourselves in meaningless gossip but the exchange of useful information...
Phonia: Beside, I'm just a commmon "cog" while you are the heroes who have "saved Mondstadt" on your resumes. Someone like me is not worth much of your precious time.
Paimon: Hey, that's a bit offensive! We're not the type to... use people and treat them as tools!
 Plus we're not that vain...
 Nor that arrogant!
Phonia: Oh, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. A "cog" is simply how I define myself.
Phonia: I am just an ordinary person with no talent. I have neither the capability nor the determination to take charge. The only role I'm fit to play on the stage of the machine that is the Knights of Favonius is that of a "cog."
Phonia: Or you can also call me a "pawn" or "gear"... I don't mind.
Paimon: Putting it like that is totally heartless!
Phonia: Heartless? I actually find it to my liking.
Phonia: There's no need for me to overthink anything or do things according to my own will. I simply do what my superior says. Get to work on time, and leave on time. Life is simple.
Phonia: There's a rumor going around that says: "In emergency situations the Honorary Knight has command authority on the front lines equivalent to a captain." Who knows, I may have the chance to be temporarily assigned to your unit in the future.
Phonia: Of course, every situation is different, and every task has a different priority. We are currently not in any such critical sitaution [sic], so I can just focus on the "Annihilate the Invasive Anglers" task that I've been assigned.
Phonia: As such, I must ask you two to keep some distance from me while I work. Both my equipment and I require a quiet working environment.
Phonia: You certainly wouldn't want some "cogs" to malfunction and affect the entire "machine," would you?
 So you're shooing us away...
 You're as cold as ice...
Paimon: Hmph! Paimon rarely sees a knight so willing to close the door and leave the world behind! Or maybe... they're a "heartless workaholic"!
Paimon: C'mon (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)! Let's leave her here to do her work all alone!
 You are...
Phonia: I just told you the most important information, but as it seems that's not enough for you. I'll supplement it with a few more words.
Phonia: I am Phonia, a member of the intelligence division of the investigation team. Though I have served for 6 years, I have only carried out 67 battlefield support ops and 31 direct action ops.
Phonia: My greatest martial accomplishment was defeating 1 Hilichurl Brute, 2 Hilichurl Shamans, and a few Hilichurl Shooters with Ematol using simple roadside explosives, mopping up a small area of the forest...
Phonia: As you can see, the gap in combat capability between me and you, Honorary Knight, is as wide as that between a boar and Stormterror. Perhaps you will simply forget about an unimportant, ordinary knight like me in a couple days.
Paimon: What's going on? Why are you suddenly... giving us a work report? So serious...
 There's no need to be so tense...
 Just think of us as new friends...
Paimon: Yeah! Even though (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) is an Honorary Knight, we're not on duty now! Just relax!
Paimon: We're always meeting all kinds of people in the wilderness, and it's really great when we talk and talk and end up becoming friends!
Phonia: I see. You wish to dicuss [sic] personal matters. Let me think...
Phonia: I'm Phonia, 26 years old, single. I currently live in the third room on the third floor of the third building to the right of the city gates. I have a roommate who's also my tenant called Ematol, and the monthly rent is... I forget, it's not important.
Phonia: My hobby is to sleep. After work, I just go home and sleep. If it's too noisy, I'll have some wine to help me sleep. I don't remember what kind of wine I used to drink, but that's not important either. As long as it can get me drunk, it's good wine.
Phonia: Sometimes I stay at the secret camp near Dragonspine temporarily in accord with Captain Albedo's orders. I like it there because it's quiet, so I can have a good sleep without anyone disturbing me.
 So your hobby is actually "quietness"?
Phonia: That's a valid point. A quiet environment and high-quality sleep are beneficial for my work. After all, my exceptional hearing is my most valuable skill.
 Is your personal life that... mechanical, too?
Phonia: Hmm... You're the first one to point out my life is machine-like. I think that's great, living a routine life keeps me away from trouble.
Paimon: (Paimon feels like this knight... is incredible at killing conversations! Paimon doesn't know how to respond...)
Paimon: (And she keeps going on about her interests, which are still related to work... Paimon gonna give her a nickname... The "Silent Workaholic"!)
Phonia: Thanks, The Helper in White. That's a good nickname. If we ever need a callsign in the team, I'll use that.
 !
Paimon: !
Phonia: Honorary Knight and The Helper in White, if you do not require further information from me... then please excuse the Silent Workaholic to resume her recon work.
Paimon: Y—You... You go ahead. We'll leave you to it!
 "Acoustic recon"?
Paimon: It sounds impressive... but it looks like you're just standing by the lake, not moving a muscle? Paimon doesn't see any equipment around, either.
Phonia: Good topic, Honorary Knight and The Helper in White. You have noticed how compact Captain Albedo's handcrafted equipment is. Hostiles won't be any to spot it either in the future!
Phonia: I have already deployed the recon equipment's active unit underwater. It utilizes a special wave... Anyway, it surveys the nearby area with the help of Hydro.
Phonia: I'm wearing the unit's receiver in my ears, and it's about the size of regular earplugs. The detection signal of the active unit is transmitted directly to me.
Phonia: With these sound signals, I am able to analyze the locations of all Anglers and lock onto their nests by plotting their path and information on the map. Then, Ematol can come in and eradicate them in one go.
 That amazing?
Paimon: It's almost like magic!
Phonia: Truly incredible alchemical creations appear no different from magic to the untrained eye. When other technologies reach a certain maturity, similar high-level creations will also be created.
Phonia: For example, I heard Fontaine manufactures large volumes of clockwork tech-based... humanoid machines. They can even take on the responsibility of defending the city. That also seems like magic to me.
Phonia: But I digress... Anyway, according to Captain Albedo, after a few discussions with Jean and the other captains, they reached a consensus...
Phonia: "The combat capabilities of the Knights of Favonius must be steadily improved with the minimum budget."
 Improve your combat capabilities?
Phonia: Yeah. The intermittent reports from the expedition team have given us a clearer picture of our far away enemies. Some are just too powerful for our knights to handle effectively at their current skill level.
Phonia: The Knights of Favonius must continue to improve, striving for zero casualties and minimal resource consumption while eradicating potential invaders of Mondstadt and protecting everyone. For this purpose, there are no standards that are too high.
 Minimum budget?
Phonia: Yes. We are currently at peace, so before the Knights of Favonius approve any military-related budget, we have to consider the impact on the civilians. Our citizens' needs come first, and we can use what's left for military improvements.
Phonia: Under such conditions, Mora must be spent only when necessary. Therefore, we need to verify which aspects to enhance that will bring about the highest improvement on overall combat capabilities.
Paimon: But how is that related to what you're doing now...? Like this "Annihilate the Invasive Anglers" operation?
Phonia: Good question, Helper in White. To put it simply, the conclusion from the meeting at that time was "information."
Phonia: The most cost efficient way to improve is by enhancing the knights' ability to acquire information, allowing them to gain the initiative on the battlefield and engage enemies from a more advantageous positions at the proper time.
 I see! So you're testing out new equipment!
Phonia: I'm impressed, Honorary Knight. Communicating with you is indeed efficient and straightforward.
 I still don't get what it has to do with you...
Phonia: Perhaps I talked too much about the nature of the issue, which might be too broad... Back to the topic at hand, I am testing new equipment.
Phonia: My job in the investigation team, a Signals Officer, and the equipment I'm using, are some of the earliest products of the Knights of Favonius' plan to improve our combat capabilities.
Phonia: The equipment shares similar design principles with the survey device Captain Albedo provided Mika with. This one has better battery life, increased accuracy against small targets, and is more convenient to use.
Phonia: As one of the first Signals Officers trained to use this equipment, I am responsible for being a military instructor, training a large cohort of Signals Officers for the frontline.
Phonia: Ideally, a few Signals Officers will be assigned to each platoon. They will use detection equipment to acquire information about enemies while they are still distant, allowing them to utilize the intelligence to deploy the most advantageous tactics.
Paimon: Now Paimon's lost... Why make something as simple as a fight so complicated!? When we see enemies, we prefer the hands-on approach and just go at them...
 If we win, pure glee.
 If we lost, we flee.
Phonia: You are heroes. We are cannon fodders. We're different.
Phonia: To avoid being cannon fodder torn to pieces by heroes like you, we regular knights have to actually use our brains. At least... we put some distance between us before you come charging over.
Phonia: Being easily trampled on isn't acceptable. We knights are tasked with the protection of Mondstadt. We can't afford to be reckless.
Paimon: Hey! How can you say something so demoralizing with a straight face!?
Paimon: Still, you've got a point. We never considered that... The opponents we've defeated might actually be warriors, who actually trained hard every day...
 Warriors must have the dignity of a warrior!
 Carry on with the testing, Signals Officer!
Phonia: Thank you for the encouragement, and for taking notice of a regular knight like me. I hope to one day fight by your side.
 We'll leave you be. Goodbye!
Phonia: Take care! If you encounter the others, please remind them to keep a low profile. Thanks!
(After finishing the last event challenge)
Phonia: Honorary Knight, and The Helper in White. Phonia of the Investigation Team, reporting. We just completed carrying out an urgent mission called "Annihilate the Invasive Anglers," and are now returning to camp.
 How's the situation?
Phonia: It went smoothly. The threat has been completely eliminated. You can rest easy.
Phonia: Do you have any further instructions?
Paimon: Th—That's so formal, like she's reporting to a senior officer. Should we also act the part?
Paimon: "*Ahem*... Good job, Signals Officer Phonia! Please be sure to share what you've learned from this experience with the other knights!"
Paimon: ...Like that?
 Captain Paimon!
 Nicely put, Paimon!
Phonia: ...
Phonia: Thank you for your approval, Helper in White. However, it may be too difficult for me to effectively teach my colleagues based on this experience.
Phonia: Although the operation of this detection equipment has already been greatly simplified, it still is beyond the capability of people who with weaker spatial cognition to operate.
Phonia: During operation, the jumbled signals from targets of similar sizes, as well as environmental noise and interference, can all easily overwhelm the user in a torrent of information.
Phonia: Forget about training the rest of the platoon, even just training the other Signals Officers to be familiar with its operations would be a gargantuan task requiring significant time...
Phonia: If it is to become standard equipment, it requires further improvements to make it more accessible, even at the cost of performance.
Paimon: What? Cognition? Standard equipment... Accessibility...
Paimon: Y—You lost Paimon again!
Phonia: The details don't matter. Anyway, I am not complaining to you two but objectively analyzing the current situation.
Phonia: All I can say is, Captain Albedo's minimum requirement of meeting "1/3 of Mika's spatial cognition and anti-interference capabilities" is still too much to ask.
Phonia: In any case, I will continue to help improve this piece of equipment until it is suitable for becoming standardized equipment or proven to be unsuitable.
Phonia: Once a relatively mature prototype is produced... Would you two like to try it?
Phonia: With it, you can confirm distant targets without visual contact. If you have any ways to... attack enemies at range, you can launch a preemptive attack and gain a tactical advantage.
Paimon: Th—That incredible?
 We could detect targets far away?
 But it can only be used underwater... That seems a bit limiting...
Phonia: No worries. By changing the Alchemy Potion used in the core, this equipment can detect the energy fluctuations of different elements.
Phonia: For example, when using an Anemo Potion to detect targets, it can accurately detect targets like Hilichurl Brutes within a range three times greater than the [sic] a regular bow's attack range within Mondstadt.
Phonia: In situations like that, top archers like Amber the Outrider would be able to conduct "non-line-of-sight shooting" in groups and continuously adjust their firing angle based on observation reports from allies with higher vantage points.
Phonia: The enemies might never see the attack coming, and would already been turned into Wolfhooks by their arrows before they figured out what was happening.
Paimon: When you put it that way, it sounds amazing...
Paimon: (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) doesn't usually use a bow. (‍HeHeText for male Traveler/SheSheText for female Traveler‍) just charges straight into enemies and beats them up... or sometimes just gets bombarded by those Ruin Guards from a distance.
Paimon: Though it's kind of maddening, Paimon has to admit that sometimes... being able to attack at range really does have a lot of advantages!
Paimon: From just how far away could Amber hit a target if she was using such miraculous equipment? Even Paimon's really looking forward to finding out!
 "Annihilate the Invasive Anglers"?
Phonia: You may already have heard of this mission and heard my briefing, but were likely too busy to have paid it much attention...
Phonia: So allow me to briefly introduce it once more—
Phonia: A certain merchant "released" some Anglers, native to Sumeru, into Cider Lake, which then began to multiply rapidly.
Phonia: To prevent these invasive creatures from impacting the water quality of Cider Lake and affecting Mondstadt's wine industry, the Knights of Favonius dispatched a unit with strong recon capabilities to undertake a limited operation.
Phonia: I, Signals Officer Phonia of the Investigative Team, and my colleague Weapons Specialist Ematol, received orders to use limited force to precisely eliminate the invasive species with minimal collateral damage.
Phonia: Currently, Ematol and I have deployed 457 bombs and cleared out 203 nests and all the invasive Anglers, successfully eliminating the negative effects resulting from the introduction of the invasive species.
Phonia: According to the calculations of other colleagues, it will take about a week for the residual explosive remnants in the water to fall to safe levels.
Paimon: S—Such precise numbers!
 Incredible!
 Good job!
Phonia: Thank you for your approval.
Phonia: This operation has also allowed me to verify a large quantity of information necessary to the development of the Signals Officer corps. As a cog in the Knights of Favonius' grand machine, I have reaped significant benefits.
 Goodbye!
Phonia: Goodbye to both of you.
Phonia: If there's a chance, I hope I can show you the results of the improved equipment in the near future.

Mutual Security Enhancing Simulation[]

Phonia: We meet again, Honorary Knight. When Su Ding mentioned he planned on inviting a reliable outside expert to join us, I immediately thought of you.
 Sorry, I don't remember you very well...
Phonia: That's fine, after all, I'm just a cog in the machine. Officers don't necessarily have to remember the name of everyone serving under them, just their positions and duties. That's enough to be able to effectively give orders.
Phonia: I'm Phonia, formerly a Signals Officer of the Investigative Team. I'm responsible for testing alchemical instruments developed by Captain Albedo and exploring the uses of remote reconnaissance technology.
Phonia: However, in light of how the Knights of Favonius have updated their tactics and the staffing structure now that some units from the expeditionary force have returned, Captain Albedo applied to have me assigned to the reorganized 7th Company.
Phonia: The 7th Company is temporarily designated as a "Combined Arms Company," which integrates knights with a range of capabilities into a single combat unit, with a balance of ranged and melee firepower. Such a unit is also very reliant on reconnaissance.
Phonia: When the time comes, the expeditionary force's No. 2 — the venerable Commander Frederica Gunnhildr might become our Company's Captain.
Phonia: After all, Commander Frederica has served for longer than many Knights have been alive, and her experience in battle is unmatched. It wouldn't be too much to say she is perfectly suited for leadership.
 Gunnhildr? That sounds familiar...
 Isn't that also Jean's last name...?
Phonia: Correct! Commander Frederica is the Acting Grand Master's mother, and is famous throughout Mondstadt.
Phonia: She's been on active duty on the front lines for decades on end, never tiring or slowing. When the youths of Mondstadt talk of their dreams of being a hero, the name "Frederica" is never far from their lips.
Phonia: And I was one of them! When I joined the Knights of Favonius, it was because of my admiration for Commander Frederica...
Phonia: Of course, I later realized that I was only talented enough to be just one more cog in the machine. As for the heroic protagonists of the storybooks that can take on a hundred foes all alone... that's another story.
 Jean's mother...
 Might become a Captain?
Phonia: That's only my speculation as a Signals Officer. As I see it, the 7th Company will likely be one of the most formidable units, and so Commander Frederica would be the most suitable candidate for Captain.
Phonia: Though Commander Frederica's position in the Knights of Favonius long surpassed any ordinary Captain, she doesn't seem to like pushing paperwork around and insists on staying on the front lines, toe-to-toe with foes.
Phonia: In principle, the Knights of Favonius value ability and experience equally, so after she returns, perhaps we'll see the Acting Grand Master giving orders to Commander Frederica...
Phonia: The two of them should have absolutely seamless synergy.
 I feel like I've seen you before...
Phonia: That's right! We've met once before, while I was executing the "Annihilate the Invasive Anglers" operation.
Phonia: Since then, I've been carrying out experiments to advance alchemical detection equipment as planned, and have worked with the Reconnaissance Company and Outriders on numerous occasions.
Phonia: Over time, I slowly became a slightly more important cog in the Knights of Favonius's intelligence machine, and that's why I was chosen to participate in this event.
Phonia: Who knows, maybe the next time you return to the Knights to take on a commission, the intel I gather will be useful to you!
 How do you think the Wargame is going?
Phonia: The thing that strikes me most is how each nation has a vastly different approach to fighting.
Phonia: Due to the different levels of focus on the size of their forces and training, the Millelith are concerned more with formations and the disposition of their troops.
Phonia: When clearing out hordes of monsters, they're like a steel-flanked juggernaut. They can just directly roll over an entire camp of the beasties, crushing everything in their path. Offense and defense all in one, completely unstoppable.
Phonia: When operating on terrain ill-suited to deploying a wide front line, they'll split up, reassembling into multiple smaller formations of the appropriate dimensions such that their flexibility to pursue their objectives isn't compromised.
Phonia: Even if an opponent studies their tactics and formations, and their intelligence is accurate, it would still be difficult to find a weakness to exploit.
Phonia: Fortunately, this style requires a very high degree of awareness and discipline from every soldier. In all of Teyvat, maybe only Liyue's Millelith can do that...
 I won't keep you any longer.
Phonia: Then we'll talk more next time, Honorary Knight.
