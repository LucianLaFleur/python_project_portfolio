Venerare was the leader of the early generations of the Lawrence Clan who lived approximately 2600 years ago.[Note 1]
Under her guidance, the original Anemo Archon Statue was built in the plaza of the city of Mondstadt, with an inscription of the oath to defend Mondstadt written beneath. However, after the statue was torn down by her descendants in the late Aristocratic Period, the inscription was lost and can no longer be seen on the rebuilt statue.[1]
She had an as of yet unclear relationship with Leonard, having helped him reach Pilos Peak.[2]

Trivia[]
The Latin word venerare is a conjugated form of the verb veneror, meaning "to worship, adore, revere, or venerate."
Notes[]

↑ Venerare knew Leonard, who must have been alive before Barbatos became the Anemo Archon in order to climb Pilos Peak, but she was also alive post-Barbatos' ascension due to constructing the original statue of Barbatos in the plaza.
