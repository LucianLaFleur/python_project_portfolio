Akame Kanenaga (Japanese: 赤目兼長 Akame Kanenaga) was a historical figure from Inazuma and a member of the Akame School during Kaedehara Yoshinori's, Kaedehara Kazuha's great-grandfather, time. During the Case of the Eccentric, he aided Scaramouche's plan to undermine the Raiden Gokaden by abandoning the Isshin Art and going on a self-imposed exile to Snezhnaya.
After learning of the Isshin Art's decline as a result of the incident, Kanenaga forged the Kagotsurube Isshin out of regret.

Story[]
Akame Kanenaga was a practitioner of the Akame School, a branch of the Raiden Gokaden's Isshin Art. While the Isshin Art's Kaedehara Clan were master bladesmiths who forged blades in Futsu Masayoshi's style and the Niwa Clan mastered the art of clay tempering, the Akame School was known for creating blades meant for killing. Because of this, the authorities rescinded the Akame School's leadership over the Isshin Art only three generations after Akame Mitsunaga's skills won them that position. Likewise, Kanenaga — who lived several generations after Mitsunaga — was never able to become the head blacksmith.[1]
Later on, the Isshin Art was drawn into a scandal masterminded by Scaramouche, or Kunikuzushi. The Raiden Shogun bestowed them with the task of forging an important blade using an Ancient Forging Blueprint. Unbeknownst to them, however, Scaramouche tampered with the blueprint and as a result, the blacksmiths failed to produce a blade by the due date. Fearing punishment, many of them fled[2] and went under the Fatui's protection, entering exile in Snezhnaya. Kanenaga was one such blacksmith.[1][3]
Although Kaedehara Yoshinori and the Kamisato Clan head at the time discovered the truth, after narrowly escaping death at Scaramouche's hands, they decided to cover up the incident and take the blame for their failure.[2] While the Kamisato Clan was spared from punishment thanks to Yae Miko's intervention,[4] neither the Kaedehara Clan nor the Isshin Art were as lucky. Yoshinori ended the family's blacksmithing business to protect his family and his son, Kazuha's grandfather, was never able to revive it.[2] The Isshin Art, without any practitioners left, dwindled and lost its prestige.
Upon learning of this, Kanenaga was filled with remorse. He spent the remainder of his days creating a sword with which he hoped to restore the Kaedehara name and prove to the people of Inazuma that the Isshin Art was still trustworthy. This sword was the Kagotsurube Isshin, a sword with a consciousness and a desire to fulfill its creator's wishes; however, during its journey from Snezhnaya to Inazuma, the Tatarigami used to create it corrupted its consciousness and drove it into an obsession to prove its worth against the gods.[3]
