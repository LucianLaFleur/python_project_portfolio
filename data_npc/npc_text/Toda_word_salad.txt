Toda wears the standard shrine maiden uniform consisting of a white kosode and red hakama, white tabi socks, and regular okobo sandals with red straps. Her black hair is cut into a chin-length bob, and although not so visible in-game, the frontal portions of her hair are separated with dark brown accessories.

Dialogue[]

Toda: Alas, O nation of Eternity...
Toda: ...Ah, hello. What can I do for you?
 You are...
Toda: My name is Toda. I am the liaison between the Yashiro Commission and the Grand Narukami Shrine.
Toda: My daily work is to handle all the issues in the shrine, such as fund raising, allocating manpower, and such...
Toda: All trivial matters, I know. Still, it is my solemn honor to be working for the Kamisato Clan.
 Tell me a little more about the Kamisato Clan.
Toda: Within the Kamisato Clan, the Commissioner Kamisato Ayato is in charge of all the Yashiro Commission's affairs. Miss Ayaka is in charge of everything in the mansion.
Toda: Inazuma's Tri-Commission have some really complicated relationships with each other. Although the Yashiro Commission is the least controversial among them, it is still very busy.
Toda: As such, Sir Kamisato doesn't really stay in the mansion too often. If you need something from the Kamisato Clan, it's better that you visit Miss Kamisato or Mr. Thoma.
 You look very worried...
(Before completing Transient Dreams)

Toda: Ah, you noticed... I've heard from the shrine maidens that more and more people wish to abolish the Sakoku Decree.
Toda: If the Sakoku Decree cannot bring happiness to Inazuma, what kind of impact will it have on the other nations in Teyvat...
Toda: ...I don't really have a conclusion for now. But as a member of the Yashiro Commission, all I can do is trust in the Almighty Shogun.
Toda: If it is in the Shogun's decision, then it must be beneficial to Eternity...
(After completing Transient Dreams)

Toda: Well, I wouldn't call it "worry" exactly. With the Sakoku Decree's abolition, I'm sure that Inazuma will undergo some changes.
Toda: I can't be sure what effects this reopening will have on the other nations of Teyvat...
Toda: ...But though I can't say anything conclusively at the moment, as a member of the Yashiro Commission, all I can do is trust in the Almighty Shogun.
Toda: If it is the Shogun's decision, then it must be meant to achieve Eternity somehow...
 Goodbye.
Toda: Aye... see you!
