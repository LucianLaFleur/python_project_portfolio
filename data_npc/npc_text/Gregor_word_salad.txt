Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Gregor: I'm thinking about taking a trip back to Mondstadt when I've got things covered here.
 About Mondstadt...
Gregor: Ah, Mondstadt! My beautiful homeland, where even time seems to flow more slowly...
Gregor: I got admitted into the Akademiya a few years ago, so I left Mondstadt and came here.
Gregor: That was the first time I'd been away from home. I was thrilled and nervous. I looked forward to seeing exotic landscapes while also fearing that I might not be able to live on my own...
Gregor: But after I really started my academic life here, my busy schedule has rid me of all the mixed feelings.
Gregor: Haha, I did many stupid things when I first arrived...
 I'm all ears.
Gregor: When I got my offer and saw the Grand Sage's signature, I was so proud of myself. Thought it was the proof of his recognition.
Gregor: But later I found that everyone has received the same acceptance letter with his signature on it! What a fool I was to believe that the Grand Sage saw something special in me.
Gregor: But Sumeru is indeed different from Mondstadt. People here are more serious but less romantic.
Gregor: For example, my Darshan, Haravatat, focuses on linguistics, but we seldom discuss literature. Instead, we spend a lot of time studying syntax and structure.
Gregor: But I heard that some people have been trying to organize a light novel society. Although they're not from the Akademiya, it more or less shows that the people of Sumeru aren't all so stiff and rigid.
 See you.
Gregor: Goodbye, may the wind bless you.

Nighttime[]

Gregor: The wine here tastes more bitter than those from Mondstadt, but I'm used to it now.
 About the wine from your hometown...
Gregor: Clear and cool water from Cider Lake can grant any wine a tint of sweetness...
Gregor: *sigh* That being said, I've only had it once.
Gregor: Before my departure, my friends and family held a banquet specially for me at the Cat's Tail. At that time, I had just come of age and was about to leave for Sumeru.
Gregor: Later, my parents wrote in several letters that they knew some merchants who could bring me some cider.
Gregor: But I refused for fear that my homesickness would grow stronger.
Gregor: Thankfully my parents are both very healthy, so I don't have to worry about them when I'm away. I can be reunited with them once I graduate from here.
 Take it easy.
Gregor: Oh... Thank you.

Trivia[]
Gregor's existence was first alluded to in a message on the Cat's Tail Message Board.
