Dugu Shuo's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Dugu Shuo is a young orphan located in Chihu Rock, running along the road in front of Hanfeng's Ironmongers. He appears to be cared for by the people in the area, as the blacksmith, Master Zhang, fashioned a knife (or as Shuo insists, a short sword) for him.
Shuo appears to have a bit of a complex over his young age and thus, his height: he wishes to obtain a Geo Vision so he can use it to create a tall pillar to stand on so everyone will have to look up at him.

Dialogue[]

Dugu Shuo: Looking for a hero? I'm your guy. So, what do you need?
 Hero...?
Dugu Shuo: Don't give me that look!
Dugu Shuo: You're giving me that look that says, "Who's this pint-sized pipsqueak half the height of his own sword telling me he's some sort of hero!" Don't even try to deny it.
Dugu Shuo: Hmph! With this sword from the blacksmith, I ain't scared of anyone!
Dugu Shuo: Once I get my Geo Vision, I'm gonna be the most legendary hero this world's ever seen!
 Why Geo?
Dugu Shuo: Do I really need to spell it out?
Dugu Shuo: With the power of Geo in my hands. I could conjure up a giant stone pillar beneath my feet!
Dugu Shuo: Then everyone would have to look up to me, mwuhahaha...
 Nice knife you got there.
Dugu Shuo: Knife? You call this a knife? ...It's a sword, obviously!
Dugu Shuo: It's called the Dugu Longsword. The blacksmith made it specially for me.
Dugu Shuo: He also thought of a motto for me: "Longsword in hand and the world at my feet"!
Dugu Shuo: He even inscribed it on the sword for me to make sure I don't forget it. Such a great guy!
 Goodbye.
Dugu Shuo: Hmph. We will meet again, fellow wanderer!

Event Dialogue[]
Lantern Rite[]

Dugu Shuo: Looking for a hero? No... Looking for a mighty hero? I'm your guy.
 Mighty hero?
Dugu Shuo: That's right. Heroes are always commemorated at Lantern Rite.
Dugu Shuo: Hmph, and one day I too shall become a hero that's revered by one and all, I'm certain of it!
Dugu Shuo: Just you wait. By this time next year, crowds will be gathering to light lanterns for me, hehe...
 But this is the festival for remembering fallen heroes.
Dugu Shuo: Huh? You mean they don't commemorate you unless you're dead?
Dugu Shuo: You're joking, right? I—I don't believe you!
Dugu Shuo: W—Well then, never mind about next year's Lantern Rite...
Dugu Shuo: In 50 years... No, in 100 years, everyone will remember this mighty hero during Lantern Rite!
 Never mind.
Dugu Shuo: Well then don't waste my time. I've got much to do yet on my journey to becoming a mighty hero.

Trivia[]
Dugu Shuo is one of the few Liyue NPCs whose name is phonetically transcribed in the Japanese localization; most other NPCs use Sino-Japanese readings of the Chinese characters.
Etymology[]
The exact origins of Dugu Shuo's name is unclear, but it may be derived from Dugu Qiubai and Dongfang Bubai, the two strongest martial artist characters in Jin Yong's wuxia novels.[3] This falls in line with several other Liyue NPCs whose names are derived from Chinese literary works.
In Jin Yong's works, Dugu Qiubai (Chinese: 独孤求败) is a legendary swordsman known as the Sword Devil, who is deceased long before the novels' events.[4] Dugu Qiubai's name roughly translates to "a solitary person who seeks defeat" (独孤 Dugu, "Alone" + 求败 Qiubai, "Seek Defeat"), since he was so powerful that no one ever could defeat him.[4]
His given name Shuo (Chinese: 朔 Shuò) is best remembered by Dongfang Shuo (Chinese: 东方朔 Dongfang Shuò), a scholar-official during the 2nd century BC and one of the two points of origin for the surname Dongfang.[3] It may be an allusion to Dongfang Bubai (lit. "Invincible East"),[3] by far the strongest martial artist character who actually appeared in Jin Yong's novels.[5]
In this theory, Dugu Shuo's obsession with obtaining good swords and a Geo Vision becomes even more satirical, because the above two wuxia characters have such transcendental skills that they no longer need powerful weapons. Dongfang Bubai can easily dominate four martial art masters just with embroidery needles and Dugu Qiubai can perform his swordsmanship without physical swords.
Reading the characters of his name directly, Dugu Shuo (Chinese: 独孤朔) may translate to "solitary new moon."
