Dialogue[]

Sekkura: Workload has been lighter with more dusk birds, but now that I need to take care of them, I also don't get to go home as often.
 Dusk birds...?
Sekkura: Dusk birds are usually used to carry messages. They're essential for my job as a Swallow Messenger.
Sekkura: While they've cut down on the need for me to run errands, I now spend a lot more time in town.
Sekkura: My home is Aaru Village, which is a small settlement on the desert edge.
Sekkura: How I long to visit Aaru Village again... It feels like an eternity since I saw Candace. We've got a lot to catch up on.
Sekkura: Such as life in the city, stories about the rainforest, and Parchamdar Rukh Shah...
 About Rukh Shah...
Sekkura: Rukh Shah is not only dependable, he's the youngest Parchamdar in Corps history!
Sekkura: Supposedly he's from the rainforest, not the desert.
Sekkura: You know how rare rainforest people are in the ranks of the Eremites, much less a Parchamdar.
Sekkura: He's very impressive, getting along not only with the desert dwellers, but Akademiya researchers too.
Sekkura: Maybe there's truth to the rumor that he was once a researcher himself.
 See you.
Sekkura: See you.
