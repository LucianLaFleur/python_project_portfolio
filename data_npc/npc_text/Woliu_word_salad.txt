 Water and soil quality...

Dialogue[]

Woliu: The qualities of the soil and water, its specific composition... All of this is worth careful study...
(If the player has not completed Temporary Acclimatization)

 And you are?
Woliu: Hello there! I'm Woliu, a hydrologist working for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and currently conducting a routine survey of Chenyu Vale's hydrological and pedological conditions.
Woliu: Hmm, looking at you... You wouldn't happen to be an adventurer, would you? Excellent, perfect... Perhaps we'll get a chance to work together!
(If the player has completed Temporary Acclimatization)

 Ms. Woliu, how have you been?
Woliu: We meet again. I'm still surveying the hydrological and soil conditions.
Woliu: I remember the slick moves you showed me last time. If it's possible, I'd like to work with you again next time. As for the reward... I guarantee you'll be satisfied!
 You seem to be studying something very profound.
Woliu: It may sound profound, but if we're talking about the basic principles, it's more like... analyzing the various ingredients and seasoning of a dish?
Woliu: The most difficult part of this job is obtaining samples and determining effective components, both of which require highly specialized equipment to complete.
Woliu: Sometimes, I even use consumable devices from Fontaine in addition to my equipment from Liyue.
Woliu: If you carefully calculate the costs, this work is a pretty expensive undertaking! Without an appropriate organization allocating funds, most people couldn't handle all the required outlays.
Woliu: Even researchers sent by the Akademiya probably can't cover all of the expenses, so just trying to transplant tea trees from Chenyu Vale to Sumeru is a fool's errand.
Woliu: As far as the Ministry of Civil Affairs is concerned, if we can completely understand the composition of the soil, and determine the essential components critical for commercial crops...
Woliu: Then it'll be easy to pump up production of our biggest cash crops!
Woliu: Yeah, when I think about it that way, my work is pretty awesome!
 See you.
Woliu: ...Huh. Was someone speaking to me just now?
