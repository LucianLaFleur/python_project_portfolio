Dialogue[]

Sonny: ...You're right, dear Luca. I do hope that such a regrettable incident won't happen again.
Luca: ...
Sonny: Why, if it isn't our old friend! What a coincidence, bumping into you! How have you been?
 About Virgil...
Sonny: Right, are you interested in fishing? In Fontaine, there are all sorts of fish that make fishing truly rewarding. Am I right, my dear Luca?
Luca: ...
Sonny: *sigh* Shame, he seems to have his own more... tedious pursuits. Still, I am certain that you understand. Am I right, my dear (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)?
Sonny: Here's some fresh catch. Please take it. I am sorry to interrupt you, it's just that I really wanted to share this... novel fun of exercising with you.
(Obtain  Fish ×4)
 How've been things for you?
Sonny: I hope you're right! While there's always something unpleasant to deal with, as we say in Fontaine, "that's life."
Sonny: Don't you think so, dear Luca?
Luca: Life? Hmph!
Sonny: You see? Luca's wit is as electrifying as ever. I'm overjoyed to hear him answer your question so concisely.
 See you.
Sonny: Truly, this was a wonderful encounter for a beautiful day. Goodbye, dear friend.
Luca: See you.

Trivia[]
Similarly to how his companion Sonny is inspired by Sonny Corleone from the crime film The Godfather, Luca is inspired by the character Luca Brasi from the same film.
Luca's alias, "The Fisherman," is also a reference to The Godfather, wherein the death of the character Luca Brasi is signified to Sonny Corleone via a "Sicilian message" consisting of a dead, packaged fish.
