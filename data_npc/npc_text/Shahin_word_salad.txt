Media:VO Shahin All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Shahin: (This place is so boring... Maybe I should have another chat with that researcher.)

Dialogue[]

Shahin: People here are really bad at keeping a conversation going, so lame.
 Hello.
Shahin: Oh, hello! I rarely meet anyone here who would start a conversation with me.
Shahin: Great hero, where are you from? What are you doing here?
Shahin: I'm not making this up, the people in this garden are so boring. All they ever say to a question is "I don't know," "I'm not sure," and "Stop asking about it."
Shahin: I expected working away from the city to be fun, but accepting work in the city with the Corps of Thirty seems much better now.
 About the Corps of Thirty...
Shahin: They're the biggest group of the Eremites in Sumeru, and they mainly focus on work in Sumeru City. Even the color of their clothes isn't the same as ours, they look so much more stylish.
Shahin: I don't know why they're called the Corps of Thirty, I've seen far more of them than that.
Shahin: Maybe it's because they frequently collaborate with the Akademiya, and that air of seriousness has rubbed off on them, so I don't really like them.
Shahin: *sigh* What's the point of saying all of that... Aren't I working for the Akademiya too... Haha...
Shahin: Luckily, I'm not anywhere near the sages, so I have a little more freedom.
 See you.
Shahin: Huh, are you ignoring me too?
