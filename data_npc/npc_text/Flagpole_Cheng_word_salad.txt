Dialogue[]

Flagpole Cheng: Ah! The enemy is attack—
Flagpole Cheng: ...Oh, you're not the enemy. Phew, you scared the life out of me!
 What are you doing?
Flagpole Cheng: Just following orders from Sarge. If the enemy attacks, I have to report it straight away...
Flagpole Cheng: But I'm short-sighted, and... I'm still waiting on my new spectacles after I broke the last pair...
Flagpole Cheng: In the meantime... *sigh* Let's just hope it stays calm around here.
 Seen anyone around that looks a lot like me?
Flagpole Cheng: Oh... So you were looking for someone to talk you [sic]... You gave me a fright.
Flagpole Cheng: Speaking of which, someone did show up some time ago who had a very similar silhouette to yours...
Flagpole Cheng: ...But my glasses had already been broken before that. It's also possible that you passed this way earlier and I caught sight of you.
Flagpole Cheng: So, is the person I saw the one you're looking for? I don't know either...
 Goodbye.
Flagpole Cheng: While the Millelith stands guard, e—evil shall, um, n—never prevail... Anyway, take care, sir... no wait, ma'am...?
Flagpole Cheng: ...Sorry, I can't see your face clearly at this distance.
