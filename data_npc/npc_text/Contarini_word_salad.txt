 A strange dream...
Media:VO Contarini 01.ogg "*yawn* I'm so sleepy... Why did I have such a strange dream?"

Dialogue[]

Contarini: *yawn* I was out for so long... But I'm still so sleepy... Why did I have such a strange dream...
 And you are...
Contarini: Me? Contarini Tiepolo, of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, at your service.
Contarini: I'm on leave at the moment, but if you encounter any violations of the law, please come straight to me anyway.
Contarini: *sigh* Well, I say that, but it's not often that I come out on vacation, and yet I haven't had enough rest at all... *yawn*
 A strange dream, perhaps?
Contarini: That's right, and for some reason it was an especially strange one. In the dream, I was constantly fighting with these weird fellows. No different from work, really...
Contarini: There was a strange researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute in my dream who claimed that they had discovered the secret treasure of the Liliacruces Ordo, and planned to transform us all into clockwork meka...
Contarini: And not the normal kind, I'm talking about machines made of stone... I mean, it was a dream, right? Stone people don't really exist.
Contarini: Whatever the case, I've been losing sleep in the fight against those guys... I bet Captain Chevreuse would've had trouble with that, let alone me...
 Secret treasure of the Liliacruces Ordo...?
Contarini: *sigh* That's just a ridiculous legend.
Contarini: They claim that there was a secret organization several hundred years back known as the Liliacruces Ordo, and that they left behind a treasure in Petrichor that could make any wish come true.
Contarini: Sounds like exactly the sort of tale you'd tell to sucker tourists in, don't you think? But some still believe it... Like that Sumeru researcher over there.
 Rest well.
Contarini: Thanks for your kind words... *yawn* I guess I should head back and get some more sleep...
