Katou Youhei is the younger brother of Katou Shingo. During the popularity of the book A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits, he and his brother performed a summoning ritual in order for his brother to gain swordsmanship that can beat one of Domon's disciples. The spirit they've summoned possessed Shingou and forcing and helped him beat Domon's best disciple.
When Shingou was possessed, he started acting differently causing Youhei to worry about his brother. However, fearing that the knowledge of using occult arts to make his brother stronger would spread, it took him five days before he asked for help from Yae Miko. Fortunately, through the Traveler's help, he was able to convince Miko to help him.
