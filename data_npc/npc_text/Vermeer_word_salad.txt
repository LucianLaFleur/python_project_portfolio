  Open-World NPCs 




Vermeer is an open-world NPC in Liyue. Prior to completing the World Quest Luhua Landscape, he can be found southwest of Luhua Pool between two giant statues just above the tide pools. After this quest has been completed, he will move to northeast of the pool, by the ruins near a Teleport Waypoint.
Following a certain dialogue branch for the first time after completing the World Quest Luhua Landscape gives the player the Nameless Sketch.

Dialogue[]

Vermeer: Hello... Oh! You're the traveler, aren't you!
Vermeer: I heard the story about your death-defying battle with Dvalin!
 How's the painting going?
(After completing Luhua Landscape)
Vermeer I've been painting here at the side of those two statues since their eyes lit up.
Vermeer But... How should I say this? I just feel like I haven't been able to paint the perfect picture.
Vermeer It just feels like there's something missing, you know what I mean?
Vermeer It's like a dish that uses good ingredients and is cooked well, but... but something's just not there...
Vermeer I don't know how to express this feeling, and I can't grasp it, either. All I can do is continue to paint.
Vermeer Don't worry, you can laugh. Really, all this drawing is making me a little woozy. And I would have taken a short break, too...
Vermeer But every time I close my eyes, I can suddenly see the shining eyes of those statues before me. It's as if they've come alive and are staring right at me...
Vermeer Which is why I came back here to take a break. I shouldn't be able to see the statues' eyes from here...
Vermeer Ah, yes. Why don't you take this painting? It's the best one I've done so far.
Vermeer Now, if you don't mind, I'm really tired. I need a break.
Vermeer Still, what are my paintings missing... What are they missing...
(Obtain  Nameless Sketch ×1)
(Complete Achievement: Shadow Over Luhua Pool)
 You're a Mondstadter?
Vermeer: Yes, why so surprised? There are plenty of Mondstadters living in Liyue. I guess the winds of freedom blew us all over this way, haha!
 What are you up to?
Vermeer: As you can see, I'm a painter. I believe that wherever you go in the world, no matter how drab a place might seem, you can always find some color if you look closely enough.
Vermeer: I consider it my duty to travel all around the seven nations to discover brand new colors and then put them on a canvas for all to see!
 Are you looking for inspiration?
Vermeer: Yep! I saw this pool and thought, wow, what a magnificent sight!
Vermeer: Can't you see why? You've got that cool blue of the water's surface contrasted with the slightly off-white cliff face, interspersed with bits of lush green vegetation... I just want to recreate every last bit of it on the canvas!
 Goodbye.
Vermeer: May the God of Anemo protect you!

Trivia[]
Vermeer's name comes from the renowned Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer.
