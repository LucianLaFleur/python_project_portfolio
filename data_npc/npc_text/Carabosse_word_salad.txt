 New formula...
Media:VO Carabosse 01.ogg "I'll just leave this new formula to Verenata."

Dialogue[]

Carabosse: Hehe. It seems that the Truesight Potion has been marvelously successful. I think that quite a few enhanced formulas can be made, too... Vere can decide their exact proportions, I suppose.
Carabosse: Hmm? What is it? Would you like any potions made by yours truly?
 Tell me about potion-making...
Carabosse: Well now, to think that you'd be interested in such. I suppose you're also one enthralled by "possibility." Good, good.
Carabosse: You see, in potion-making...
Carabosse: You process ingredients that don't have any effects on their own, mix them together, and they'll turn into potions that can work in lots of different ways!
Carabosse: It is a deed akin to using the impression things have given you in your memories, and combining them with flashes of inspiration to create new "realities."
Carabosse: Even I do not know what the potioning possibilities are! This is the excitement of being a potioneer.
 Tell me about your assistant...
Carabosse: Oh, you mean Vere. She's an earnest girl, and she's been a great help to me in measuring potion proportions and conducting experiments.
Carabosse: She's the only one who can help me complete said experiments...
Carabosse: Ah, yes — she also names some of the products, the Truesight Potion being amongst them.
Carabosse: That said, I do think that she's too straight-laced in her naming sense. I think something like my "Coasty-Toasty Potion" is cutesier...
 No, I'm just passing through.
Carabosse: Ah, and here I thought you were going to test the potions. Oh well... Err, I mean, you're always welcome to drop by!

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
Carabosse is a staple name for wicked fairies and evil witches in fairytales.
The name Carabosse first appeared in Madame d'Aulnoy's 1697 fairytale The Princess Mayblossom, where Carabosse is an ugly and old wicked fairy who curses a newborn princess, who is called Verenata in some versions of the tale.
Incidentally, there is another Melusine called Verenata, who serves as the "Master Potioneer" Carabosse's assistant.
