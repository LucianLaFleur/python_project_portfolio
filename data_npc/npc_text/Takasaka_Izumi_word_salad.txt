Profile[]
Takasaka is a prominent yoriki that serves the Tenryou Commission. He partook in a duel against the Traveler as their final opponent and lost before Sara initiated the actual battle. While his fate is left ambiguous, he was likely killed by Kaedehara Kazuha in the ensuing battle.[Note 1]

Appearance[]
Takasaka Izumi wears a  lavender shitagi, indigo kobakama, and he is barefoot in waraji sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with dark gold accents consists of dou (breastplate) with the Inazuma Shogunate's crest, han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves). He is also wearing a kabuto (helmet) with the Shogunate's crest and sode (shoulder armor) on his left shoulder. Izumi carries a katana at his hips on the left side.

Notes[]

↑ Kazuha is seen killing a yoriki during the battle; while it is unknown how many participated, it is likely that he was the only one, seeing that no other yoriki were seen during the cutscenes.
