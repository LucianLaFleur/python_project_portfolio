Dialogue[]

Yukio: Poultry skewer with BBQ sauce, salty grilled fish, kitsune ramen... Dear customer, how would you like to try some native Inazuma snacks?
Yukio: We also serve tea. We have genmaicha, barley, and oolong. Which one would you like? We do not serve alcohol, though.
 No alcohol?
Yukio: Hmm, odd, is it? Well, think about it. If you drink too much, your taste buds will get numb, and you won't be able to taste how good the dishes are anymore.
Yukio: So even if most Inazuman snacks go well with alcohol, we don't serve alcohol here.
Yukio: To me, the bitterness and the aftertaste of tea can bring out the taste of the skewers and the sauce better. Alcohol would just cover everything up.
Yukio: Aside from the skewers, you might want to order some kitsune ramen if you want something more filling... Ah, by the way, you aren't allergic to beans, are you?
 Allergic to beans?
Yukio: There was a case like this before, so it's better safe than sorry for me to ask first.
Yukio: There was an Oni gentleman and a lady with kitsune ears who made a bet here on who could eat the most kitsune ramen.
Yukio: But there was fried tofu in the ramen, and the Oni people are allergic to beans...
Yukio: Therefore, even though that gentleman with long horns won the bet, he also almost lost his life... Was it worthwhile?
 I can't drink alcohol yet.
Yukio: I see. You aren't old enough to drink, right? That's also fine. You can order some tea while savoring some of Inazuma's snacks.
Yukio: Here, these Onigiri are freshly made today. They are delicious and filling. Please have some.
(Obtain  Onigiri ×4)
 Goodbye.
Yukio: Take care. Come back again next time.

Event Dialogue[]
Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness[]

 We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.
Yukio: Hmm? Did I hear you wrong? Is this a music festival or a food festival?
Paimon: Music, and a serious, formal musical exchange to boot! By the way, do you have any music you enjoy? We can play it for you right now!
Yukio: Oh, you're serious, then? Well, I do have something in mind. I can try humming it for you. Could you try playing it, then?
 Sure, I'll give it a go.
Yukio: Well then, this is quite the lovely surprise.
(After performing)
Yukio: Wow. What a brilliant recreation! That said, even I have no clue what this song's called, haha.
Yukio: A fox-eared customer of ours likes humming this one when she comes over for some ramen. She's one of our VIPs. Came round a few days ago, in fact, or I wouldn't have remembered that song at all.
Yukio: ...I guess that tells you all you need to know about me and music, eh?
Yukio: If you're looking for a food stall, I'd recommend you look for Tomoki.
Yukio: That fellow's got a right adventurous spirit. Even if he isn't a fan of music, he should be interested nonetheless.
(Talk to Yukio again, optional)
 How was that?
(Same as After performing)

Trivia[]
The "Oni gentleman" and "lady with kitsune ears" that Yukio refers to in his dialogue are likely Arataki Itto and Yae Miko.[1]
He sells 獣骨ラーメン jukotsu raamen which is a variation of the real food 豚骨らーめん tonkotsu raamen meaning "pork bone ramen" however the in-game variant has replaced pork (ton) with beast (ju), implying Yukio's ramen is essentially a mystery meat ramen from some undisclosed beast.
