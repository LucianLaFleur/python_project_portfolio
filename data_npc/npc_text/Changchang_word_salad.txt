Dialogue[]

Changchang: When is daddy coming back... Oh, hello, nice to meet you!
 Hello.
Changchang: Hee-hee, everyone says I'm very polite for my age. Are you waiting for someone too?
 Are you here on your own?
Changchang: Yep! But it's okay, I'm very grown-up for my age and I play by myself all the time! Grandad works in the Dockyard as a conduction worker... conduction...? Construction, construction worker. I made a boo-boo again.
Changchang: I'm not scared though, everyone's really nice here and there's the Millelith to beat up all the bad guys!
 What're you playing now?
Changchang: Right now I'm not playing. I'm doing something very important!
Changchang: I'm waiting for daddy. I've lost count of how many days he's been away now...
Changchang: But whenever daddy comes home he always brings lots and lots of pressies!
Changchang: Last time, he brought me some new clothes! And the time before that, he brought me a windmill! And the time before that, he brought me loads and loads and loads of candy!
Changchang: ...And the time before that, he brought me, erm, a porcelain doll! And, and, and... Wolfhook Cake! And a little bottle that lights up in the wind! And a purple hourglass! And...
 See you.
Changchang: Bye-bye!

Event Dialogue[]
Lantern Rite[]

Changchang: I'm Changchang, I just donated Dolly. She's my ragdoll.
Changchang: Last night in my dream, Dolly told me her wish was to fly up into the sky and see the view.
Changchang: So I gave her to the lady over by the big deer lantern. Dolly's wish will come true now, won't it?
Changchang: I did the right thing, didn't I? Wishes are supposed to come true at the Lantern Rite, aren't they?

Moonlight Merriment[]

Changchang: The Moonchase Festival is here, and Daddy still isn't back...
Changchang: The latest Masterful Chefs was super exciting. I've started learning how to cook, too!
Changchang: Once Daddy gets back, I'll make him something nice for sure.

Fleeting Colors in Flight[]

Changchang: I've got a new wish this Lantern Rite — just once, I wanna see the fireworks with Daddy!
Changchang: If he can't make it this year, then next time, then next-next time, and next-next-next time... One day, my wish will come true!

The Exquisite Night Chimes[]

Changchang: When is Daddy coming back? Is it too late to write him and ask for a flute?
(Continue non-event dialogue)

Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze[]

(After completing The Glede Returns to the Pavilion)
Changchang: When is Daddy coming back? Is it too late to write him and ask for a Suanni kite?
Changchang: I saw one, a glowing one, while playing by myself!
Changchang: Hmm... I wonder if Daddy could buy me one?

Trivia[]
In Linling's Anthology of Selected Poetry, Linling complains in a poem that Changchang's crying is disturbing the beautiful night. Given that Changchang is never seen crying, it is likely that Linling mixed up Changchang with Yi Xian.
She is one of the very few people from Liyue whose name in the Japanese localization is directly transcribed from Chinese instead of being read as the on'yomi or kun'yomi.
