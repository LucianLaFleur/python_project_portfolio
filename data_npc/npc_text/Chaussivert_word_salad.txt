Chaussivert's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Chaussivert is the self-proclaimed "Harbor-Watcher" of Lumidouce Harbor. He is a man of integrity and honesty, refusing to take dirty money.
The Traveler, Paimon and Fusilier first meet him when trying to track down Nacker, who had nearly blown up the Fontaine Research Institute in his own bid to continue researching Arkhium. He was tasked by Loillier to help smuggle someone out of Fontaine, though he had refused and was intending to teach him his "lesson" when Loillier spotted the three eavesdropping on them. Chaussivert fought the trio but lost, during which Loillier made his escape. Learning why they had come, he told them that Loillier's boss, Concini, had threatened him to keep the incident quiet and the truth behind the cargo. Realizing that it could destroy the harbor, he agreed to help them with his crew, including Lemarcq.
The group then makes their way to the Rusty Rudder, where they caught up to Covault and got information from him regarding the shipment. Covault, having bought Pattyn and Morgen off, instead ambushed them at the drop zone, but were all defeated and he fled. Chaussivert and his only loyal member, Lemarcq, returns to their ship. Lemarcq took care of Morgen by the time they returned, before they realized that they were hiding something, which the Traveler deduces that Loillier, Concini and Nacker were in cahoots with each other. Chaussivert and Lemarcq proceed to interrogate the two before presumably dumping them in the sea to drown for their betrayal. The following day, they manage to intercept the shipment and discover Edwin Eastinghouse was still alive, who claims that they would not find Nacker.
Realizing that Edwin also opposes Nacker and intentionally gave them hints, they soon discover Nacker's hideout and apprehend him alongside Edwin, returning to the Institute to hand them over. For their efforts, he and Lemarcq were compensated by the Institute and he returned to the harbor shortly afterwards, glad that the harbor was at peace once again.

 Watching Lumidouce Harbor...
Media:VO Chaussivert 01.ogg "We're the one's watching the Lumidouce Harbor."

Dialogue[]

Chaussivert: This, I'll be considered the one who watches over Lumidouce Harbor for real, right?
 How have you been?
Chaussivert: Fantastic. No one's secretly trying to get rid of me, or trying to blow up Lumidouce Harbor.
Chaussivert: And people have stopped engaging in shady practices like bribery, fraud, or backstabbing.
Chaussivert: Peace has been restored to Lumidouce Harbor. Not bad!
Chaussivert: And I played a big role in it all, too. Even better!
 Aren't you thinking about hiring more people?
Chaussivert: Yes... I'm seriously considering that, and discussing with Lemarcq.
Chaussivert: However... Haha, maybe that shameless Pattyn was right. You won't make a fortune by working with me. I doubt many people would want to get involved.
Chaussivert: But no matter what, I won't take dirty money. Otherwise... I wouldn't be able to sleep at night.
 About Loillier...
Chaussivert: I specifically went looking for him later, but the scoundrel had already made off with everything. The house was totally empty, not even a piece of paper left behind.
Chaussivert: Hmph... Greedy yet cowardly. He wouldn't dare do anything to me, not unless he had a powerful patron.
Chaussivert: A pity I can't find him now, or I'd show him my special kind of hospitality.
 Bye.
Chaussivert: Mm-hmm. On your way then.
