Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

Atefeh: So, Are you ready to make more Mora with me?
(Opens the Distributors interface)
 Check potion requirements...
Atefeh: According to my keen market sense, these are the kinds of potions that are currently in demand.
After taking invetory of the potions, Atefeh shoulders her bag and leaves...She will return to the store after one operation cycle and bring the sales results with her.
 Maybe later...
Atefeh: Hmm, okay. But don't wait too long. When it comes to making Mora, you've got to strike while the iron is hot!

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completion of a cycle.


Atefeh: Hello there. The potions from earlier have sold out.
Atefeh: I've organized the sales data for you. Feel free to have a look.


Atefeh: Let's skip right to talking about this deal, shall we?
