Dialogue[]

Amano: Hello, how can I help you?
(Before completing Transient Dreams)
 May I ask about the Almighty Shogun?
Amano: The fame of the Almighty Shogun spreads afar throughout the world. She keeps the eternal peace in Inazuma.
Amano: About the Sakoku Decree though... No, never mind. I have no problem with that.
Amano: Of course it's better that we have fewer outlanders to deal with. For the lucky few such as yourself who have come to Inazuma, you must follow the rules here.
(After completing Transient Dreams)
 May I ask about the Almighty Shogun?
Amano: The fame of the Almighty Shogun spreads afar throughout the world. She keeps the eternal peace in Inazuma.
Amano: I have never once questioned a single one of the Shogun's decisions.
Amano: Even if the Sakoku Decree has been abolished, outlanders who come to Inazuma must follow the its laws.
 Goodbye...
Amano: Goodbye, outlander.
