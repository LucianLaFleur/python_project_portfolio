Profile[]
Nète is a businessman from Fontaine who, at some point during Parvaneh's journeys through Teyvat to develop an "Omni-Spice" that can make any dish delicious, struck up a partnership with her mentor Farzah to accomplish the same objective and sell it for a high price. Upon Parvaneh's return to Sumeru Akademiya, she had Farzah review her paper, only for Farzah to plagiarize it for her own business venture with Nète.
Enraged and disgusted, the Gourmet Supremos decided to take action. After failing Farzah and Nète to back down, Xudong decided to beat them at their own game by promoting their Omni-Spice and releasing the formula for the spice mix for free, thus lowering Nète's profit opportunities. Although Nète was able to keep up with them the entire time nonetheless, he decided to give up on his partnership with Farzah in favor of recruiting Xudong into a business arrangement.
While the Gourmet Supremos initially rejected his offer, Nète approached them several more times before finally offering to sponsor their journey instead, provided that they journey to Fontaine first. The Gourmet Supremos reluctantly agreed to his offer after combing through his detailed contract and hastily departed for Fontaine.
