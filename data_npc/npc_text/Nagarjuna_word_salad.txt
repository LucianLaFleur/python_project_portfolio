Nagarjuna was a leader of the Sumeru Akademiya Darshan that encountered the Schwanenritter fighting against the Abyss in the Dharma Forest 500 years ago. Nagarjuna and his followers recognized the Schwanenritter as "heroes of Dahri" and, to carry on the Schwanenritters' will to completely destroy the cataclysm, followed the path they had taken from the Girdle of the Sands, where they assisted the Pari and Dainsleif in quelling the calamity by purifying the Harvisptokhm.[1] The Darshan stayed in the Girdle of the Sands, becoming the Order of Skeptics, and Nagarjuna was considered the first leader of the Order (their first Nasuraia/Vijnanapati,[2] i.e. "one who has epiphanies").[3]

Appearance[]
According to Zurvan, Nagarjuna had only one arm.[4]
