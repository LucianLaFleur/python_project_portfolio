Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Home Lies Over the Ocean.


(During daytime)
Michiru: Ah, my daughter has fled the country for some time now. I wonder how she's doing...
Yoh: Eh, you're going on about that again, are you?
Michiru: How could you say that? I don't even know if she is getting by or not. I wonder if she's alright...
Yoh: Didn't I tell you that someone saw her in Liyue? Just stop talking about it already.
Michiru: I know, I know. But not having seen her in person, I'm still worried...
Yoh: Just relax. She'll be okay. She is our daughter, after all!
Yoh: Our daughter has been independent since she was little. She knows how to take care of herself. She started cooking for herself at the age of seven or eight. Why, by the time she was a teenager, she could already sail out to sea by herself.
Yoh: She enjoys being free and traveling around. She must have been really unhappy at being trapped in Inazuma.
Michiru: But...
Yoh: Trust me, she'll be fine. She is out of the country, living a free and happy life. She's probably made new friends already.
Yoh: She most likely doesn't write letters to us because she doesn't want the government to find out and bring us trouble.
Yoh: Yes, that must be it...

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing Home Lies Over the Ocean.


(During daytime)
Michiru: Ah, my daughter has fled the country for some time now. I wonder how she's doing...
Yoh: Now, now, didn't our daughter say so in her letter? She's doing well! We don't have to worry.
Michiru: But... She might've been fine when she wrote this letter, but how can we be sure that she didn't encounter any trouble afterward?
Michiru: Not having seen her in person, I can't help but be worried...
Yoh: Just relax. She'll be okay. She is our daughter, after all!
Yoh: Our daughter has been independent since she was little. She knows how to take care of herself. She started cooking for herself at the age of seven or eight. Why, by the time she was a teenager, she could already sail out to sea by herself.
Yoh: She enjoys being free and traveling around. She must have been really unhappy at being trapped in Inazuma.
Michiru: But...
Yoh: Trust me, she'll be fine. She is out of the country, living a free and happy life. She's probably made new friends already.
Yoh: Whenever you think of her, take her letter out and read it again.
Yoh: If our daughter knew how much you worry about her every day, she would be troubled, too.

Dialogue Set #3[]
Available after completing Transient Dreams.


(During daytime)
Michiru: After waiting for so long, our daughter has finally returned home!
Yoh: Well, you look happy.
Michiru:  Our daughter has returned! Of course I, her mother, am happy! Aren't you?
Yoh: Of course I am! But you need to stop pulling her aside to tell her all sorts of things. She'll get sick of it!
Michiru: ...Atsuko's been gone so long... There's so much I want to talk to her about.
Yoh: Well, keep talking, then. I mean, what's the worst that could happen? That she might leave once she tires of your yakking?
Michiru: Hah! Don't you try to scare me. I've already thought all this through.
Michiru: Since she likes exploring so much, we should just let her — all I ask is that she sends us letters to tell us how she's doing.
Michiru: I mean, it will still get a little lonely when she's not around...
Yoh: Come on, you'll still have me!
Michiru: Hah, as if that's the same thing.
