 Let's form a duo!
Media:VO Keratry 01.ogg "Come on, let's form a magic duo together!"

Dialogue[]

Keratry: C'mon, brother, be my magic assistant!
Remaudiere: Hah, do you think it'll be that easy? I am so very mighty in magic — how could I be your assistant?
Keratry: Oh, I know, I know! I'll pay you a general salary! How does that sound?
Remaudiere: Don't you mean a "generous" salary? Also, who taught you those ideas about utility?
Keratry: Just tell me if you agree or not, c'mon...
Remaudiere: Well... That's a difficult question. See, I'm currently twice your age.
Remaudiere: By the time you become an adult, I'll already be in my middle age and have started to lose hair — I shan't be able to be your partner then.
Keratry: Can't I use magic to make you not grow up?
Remaudiere: Dear sister, we're speaking of magic tricks, not magic...
