Dialogue[]

Maki: Hello, are you a tourist heading to the Grand Narukami Shrine? Come in and grab a fortune slip!
 About Gendou Ringo...
(After completing The Very Special Fortune Slip)
Maki: Ah, you mean her change in outlook?
Maki: She certainly has been much more friendly to those coming to get fortune slips, and she's much more patient now when helping to resolve their problems.
Maki: We certainly have her to thank for bringing in more people to get fortune slips!
 About the Cleansing Ritual...
(After completing Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual)
Maki: Ah, yes. Lady Yae said that you're the Traveler who completed the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual.
Maki: You have my thanks. Now that the Cleansing Ritual has been completed, the Sacred Sakura is now thriving more than ever before.
Maki: The Sacred Sakura roots are connected to one another, and together they bless the land of Inazuma. You too shall be blessed as you walk upon this land.
 About the Sacred Sakura...
Maki: According to the legends, this Thunder Sakura is the physical manifestation of the Great Narukami's power. That's why it is named the Sacred Sakura.
Maki: The flowers of the Sacred Sakura tree bloom all year round, and they protect the peace and serenity of Inazuma.
 Glory to the everlasting...
Maki: ...Forever may the Electro Archon reign.
Maki: That's right. This is the "eternity" that the Electro Archon is pursuing. It seems like you already know something about Inazuma.
Maki: You can have this small floral ornament. Even though it's not formed from divine powers, it should still be able to accompany you for a long time. I wish you good luck.
(Obtain 4★  Entangling Bloom)
 About drawing fortune slips...
Maki: The people who come to the shrine are mostly looking for the archon's blessings.
Maki: They believe that if they get a good fortune slip, they will be blessed by the Electro Archon, and that life will be easy in the upcoming days.
Maki: But if they get a bad slip, they can still leave the slip at the shrine in hopes for a change of fate.
Maki: If you have any wishes, why don't you come get a slip for yourself as well?
 ...
Maki: Huh. Well, some people do believe that the wishes won't come true if they are revealed.
Maki: Whatever wish you may have, I hope that it will be granted soon.
 I want to reunite with my family.
Maki: Even the petal that drifts furthest shall one day return to the earth. The Electro Archon will watch over you.
 Goodbye.
Maki: Goodbye! All the best to you.
