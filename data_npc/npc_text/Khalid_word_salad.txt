Dialogue[]

Khalid: Hello, welcome.
 What do you have on offer? (Before reaching Tree of Dreams Level 50)
Khalid: All the jewels we currently have for sale have already been reserved.
Khalid: You mean what we have in the shop? Most are from my personal collection and are just for display.
 What do you have on offer? (After reaching Tree of Dreams Level 50)
Khalid: We'll occasionally deal in merchandise other than jewelry. Be my guest.
(Opens Souvenir Shop)
 Tell me about yourself...
Khalid: I'm an antique collector, and I sell jewelry here and there.
Khalid: Precious antiques are worth treasuring, and their prices are also out of the budgets of ordinary people, so it's not about making sales for me.
Khalid: What I do care about is whether I can get more vendors as discerning as Lord Sangemah Bay to supply me with the most valuable collectors' items.
Khalid: ...That is to say, trading is more like my side business.
Khalid: As for my main business... I suppose that would be to raise my son into a collector with taste as astute as my own.
Khalid: Feresht is a gifted child. I'm certain he can become an even more renowned antiques appraisal expert than me.
 See you.
Khalid: Take care, now.
