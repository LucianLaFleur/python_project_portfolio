Profile[]
Like several of those under Efim Snezhevich's command in Inazuma, Buzuleac appears to be an orphan who was raised in the House of the Hearth and joined the Fatui after being deemed as "having potential." While little about Buzuleac is known, he may have had some Sumeru heritage, based on his choice of disguise and his statement that Lyudochka Snezhevna was lucky to have Inazuman blood, which made it easier for her to blend in with the locals.[1]

Appearance[]
Buzuleac has light brown hair and blue eyes. He wears dark gradient gray-bluish robes with a light tan scarf draped on his neck.
