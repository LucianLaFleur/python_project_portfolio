Timmie's location (Daytime)Additional context
Profile[]
After Timmie's father left some time ago and never returned, Grace has been taking care of Timmie. While she is not biologically related to him, he considers her his mother. Because she also looks after Glory and Nora, Timmie worries about troubling her too much.
Unbeknownst to Timmie, his father died from a hunting accident. Draff, his good friend, brought him to Grace as quickly as possible, but they were too late to save him. Unable to bring themselves to tell Timmie the truth at the time, they agreed to have Grace take care of Timmie while Draff returned to Springvale, sending money and a letter to Timmie every once in a while.[3]
Timmie later partook in a Genius Invokation TCG tournament, easily wiping all the competition including Kaeya.

Appearance[]
Timmie is a young boy with pale skin, blue eyes, and short dirty blond hair.

 About Stormterror...
(Only available when both A Long Shot has been completed and Dragon Storm has not been completed, after killing the ducks in Pigeon, Duck, and Child)
Timmie: I'm thinking that Stormterror must be... a transformed flock of pigeons.
Timmie: People like you always scare them, so they turned into a dragon to get their revenge!
Timmie: But they definitely wouldn't hurt someone who's always been nice to them, like me... would they?
 There's not much I can do about it now...
Timmie: Not much you can do? Hmph. Yeah, right!
Timmie: Mommy says that as long as you love the world, no animals will be scared of you!
Timmie: Otherwise, why do you think the pigeons aren't scared of me?
 They'll be back.
Timmie: They do come back usually... But what happens if one day they leave and never come back again?
Timmie: Just like Daddy...
 Goodbye.
Timmie: Wah... I'm telling Mommy on you!

Trivia[]
Timmie will still remark on you scaring away the pigeons, regardless of whether there were any pigeons there to begin with, or if you haven't scared the pigeons due to talents (e.g., having Aloy in the party).
Timmie's imaginary friend is a Ruin Guard that can kill the people who try to scare his pigeons away.[4]
Timmie is mentioned in the Honkai Impact 3rd and Genshin Impact crossover event "Outworld Traveler". During the quest, when the player's party arrives at the bridge outside of the City of Mondstadt, they are surprised that Timmie is absent.
On Twinning Isle during the Summertime Odyssey event, The Peristerophile Night Raven is the "Immernachtreich"'s counterpart of Timmie as it yells at the player for scaring away the pigeons as well.
Timmie shares his English voice actress with Kamisato Ayaka and Marjorie and his Japanese voice actress with Xianyun and Marjorie.
