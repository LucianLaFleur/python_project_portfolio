Profile[]
Along with the other yakshas, Bonanus answered Morax's summons to fight the demons that spawned from the remains of defeated gods during and after the Archon War. Of the many yakshas, Bonanus was one of the five strongest alongside Bosacius, Indarias, Menogias, and Alatus.[2]
It is said by Xianyun that Menogias once made her a dress for one of many meetings with other adepti, which she secretly complained about due to how it would hinder her in battle due to how long it was.[3]
Like most of her fellow yakshas, Bonanus eventually succumbed to karmic debt. It is implied that she and Menogias killed each other in a battle.

Trivia[]
All other voice actors of the yakshas with uncertain identities have confirmed their credited yakshas and their corresponding elements on Twitter,[4][5] leaving Bonanus as the Hydro Yaksha.
Bonanus shares the same Japanese voice actress with Signora and Changsheng.
Etymology[]
Her Chinese title  (Chinese: 螺卷大将) literally means "General Curled Sea Snail."
