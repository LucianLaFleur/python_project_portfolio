Dialogue[]

Wakamurasaki: Hello there! Need a few more Omni-Ubiquity Nets, do you?
 I'd like to buy some.
 So, about the Omni-Ubiquity Net...
Wakamurasaki: My research into these nets is still ongoing, but I've got to say that I'm not making any progress at all.
Wakamurasaki: I've not been able to achieve the levels of sturdiness, utility, or any other parameter for that matter, that Sango told me were possible...
Wakamurasaki: Where did we go wrong, I wonder...
Wakamurasaki: I—I mean, Sango couldn't have remembered that onmyoudou technique wrongly... Right?
Wakamurasaki: I'll go ask her when the opportunity arises, just to be sure...
 See you.
Wakamurasaki: See you. Take care!
