Dialogue[]

Zhenxiang: Please wait while we perform a routine inspection.
 Inspection?
Zhenxiang: Orders have come down from the Qixing. We have to check everyone who comes through here and be on the lookout for suspicious characters.
Zhenxiang: Don't worry, unless there's an issue my Millelith comrade and I will give you no trouble.
 Why is your comrade slacking off?
Zhenxiang: He isn't slacking off. He's just... recharging.
Zhenxiang: He's in a league of his own in this job — he can do face reading! As in, he can tell instantly if you're someone to worry about, just by looking at you. Most I can do is ask a bunch of questions.
Zhenxiang: Thanks to him, it's much safer around here now.
Zhenxiang: I wish I could do what he does...
 Why are you the only one working?
Zhenxiang: My comrade knows the art of face reading, and he's right on the money every time.
Zhenxiang: He did me a while back. Said that as long as I keep working hard, and help out my comrades when needed, I will go from strength to strength in my career.
Zhenxiang: Covering for him while he takes some time out counts as helping my comrades, right? In which case, I'm definitely on track to do well for myself.
 Can you let me past?
Zhenxiang: Hmm... Well, you're not on the blacklist, as far as I can see.
Zhenxiang: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail. Thank you for your cooperation.
