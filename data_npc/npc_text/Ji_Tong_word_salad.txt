  Quest-Exclusive NPCs 




Ji Tong (Chinese: 季同 Jì Tóng) is a quest-exclusive NPC that first appeared in the Five Flushes of Fortune event. Until the World Quest Perfect Shot is completed, he can be found on the docks' street market, a couple meters north of the Liyue Harbor's northern Teleport Waypoint.
During the Five Flushes of Fortune event, he gives the Kurious Kamera gadget, which can be used to take pictures of certain objects, randomly giving the traveler a tinted picture. Collecting all tints and talking to Ji Tong will reward the player with a Fortune Trove, which contains guaranteed Primogems, and possibly Mora, Hero's Wit, and Mystic Enhancement Ore.

Event Dialogue[]

Ji Tong: Definitely need to investigate this Kamera more closely...
 Claim Fortune Trove
Ji Tong: How have the photos turned out? Let me see...
(Opens Claim Fortune Trove menu)
 Where did you get this Kamera?
Ji Tong: Oh, I bought it off a merchant from Fontaine.
Ji Tong: He said this model prints photos with a unique effect, which is certain to make it catch on.
Ji Tong: I took him at his word, but I quickly discovered that I don't recognize anything that this Kamera prints...
Ji Tong: Maybe I'm using it wrong? But I don't know how to track him down, ugh...
 Goodbye.
Ji Tong: Bye... Ugh, this Kamera, such a konundrum...
