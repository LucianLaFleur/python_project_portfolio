Nagamitsu was an apprentice of the Isshin Art alongside Akame Mitsunaga and Kaedehara Kagemitsu when Futsu Masayoshi, the bladesmith of Haran Geppaku Futsu, approached them. Having left the Futsu school to avoid a succession crisis between himself and the fourth-generation master Futsu Hiroyoshi, Masayoshi left to travel around and learn the techniques of other forging practices. The three apprenticed under Masayoshi and went on to create each piece in the Isshin Sansaku.[1]

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
The names Kagemitsu (Japanese: 景光), Nagamitsu (Japanese: 長光), and Sanenaga (Japanese: 実長) (rendered in the English localization as Mitsunaga) are derived from the three disciples of Mitsutada (Japanese: 光忠), the greatest swordsmith of the Bizen School who went on to establish the Osafune School. The three were known as the Sansaku, or Three Great Masters.
Osafune Nagamitsu, Mitsutada's son who went on to inherit the Osafune School, is most famous for forging the Dai Hannya Nagamitsu.[2]
