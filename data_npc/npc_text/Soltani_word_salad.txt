Dialogue[]

Soltani: Hello, would you like to let me show you the way?
 And you are...
Soltani: I'm a servant of this house at your service.
Soltani: Seeing as how you've been wandering aimlessly. Please pardon me... Is the butler giving random directions again?
Soltani: *sigh* If you had the "privilege" to speak to the butler, then please don't take him seriously.
Soltani: This place may seem grand and magnificent, but it's still quite remote and isolated compared to the city. The Lord prefers a life of tranquility and reclusiveness, so our household staff is limited in numbers.
Soltani: I suggest you pay attention to your surroundings when going while in the vicinity, especially when you're not within the range of this property.
 Thanks for the reminder.
Soltani: It's nothing. I was just speaking from experience.
Soltani: It is hard to meet someone as sensible and open to suggestions as you are.
(Obtain  Hero's Wit ×2)
 I'll quit bothering you then.
Soltani: Have a nice day.
