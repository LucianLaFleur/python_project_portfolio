Profile[]
Borenka serves as a naval intelligence officer for the Fatui. He was sent to Inazuma to collect Shogunate remnants recommended by Nathan for First Lord Harbinger. However, the remnants caused unnecessary attention to themselves that resulted in Shizuru and the Traveler coming to investigate and confront Borenka. Initially playing themselves off as new recruits, they decided to throw away their cover after Borenka refused to reveal any information on their orders. After being defeated once, Borenka withdrew and chugged some Fire-Water, leaving his subordinates to handle them. However, they were unable to do so and Borenka fought them a second time, only to be defeated for good.

Appearance[]
Borenka takes the appearance of a Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard.

Borenka's Orders[]

Borenka's "Orders": "...Be sure to withdraw with all haste and bring the new Inazuman recruits who retrieved the secret report that 'Nathan' wrote to the First Lord Harbinger."
Borenka's "Orders": "To prevent any repercussions from this incident, no one must know about the inner workings of what happened on Yashiori Island."
Borenka's "Orders": "The new recruits do not have any innate value to the overall goals of the Fatui, and need not be trained in any way. They will, however, do just fine as living test samples."
