Story[]
Many years ago, Siman and her friends Khayyam and Irfan often played in the forest with their Aranara friends.[3] Siman had always intended on becoming a great sage and eventually reached her goal, becoming a sage in Amurta and working with the Bimarstan.[1]
After Khayyam's memory took a turn for the worse due to his old age, Siman took charge of his treatment.[1] Recently, the Farrokhzadan became involved with the Fatui after successfully taking up a commission to exterminate a traitor. Siman took up Il Dottore's commission of capturing Aranara for his experiments, and forwarded the commission to Lunja and her men.[2][5]
