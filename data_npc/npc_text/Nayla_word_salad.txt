 How did this happen...

Media:VO Nayla All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Nayla: (We're just temporary partners, but since the boss gave the word, I guess I'll look after them for a bit.)

Dialogue[]

Nayla: King Deshret... *sigh*
 Still a believer?
Nayla: Yes, I still am. I'm an Eremite born and raised, and I grew up listening to legends of King Deshret. My beliefs will not be easily swayed.
Nayla: But I no longer believe in his revival.
Nayla: Huh, from the looks of it, I'd wager you're the new friend the boss talked about.
Nayla: The Eremites always welcome new hands, but I'll remind you that even friends are not forever.
Nayla: I, at least, will make you no guarantees that we'll always be on the same side.
 The revival of King Deshret is a lie.
Nayla: ...Yes, I know that.
