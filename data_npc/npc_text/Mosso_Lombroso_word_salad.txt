Mosso was the creator of the robot "Curve," a smart lie detector.[1]
Around 30 years ago, Mosso Lombroso developed a lie-detecting machine, believing that the emotions and feelings behind why people lie is what made them people. Mosso deliberately developed protocols to make Curve incapable of lying, so that once he could tell a lie, it would mean he had developed beyond his programming and acquired human emotions. To gather data for Curve to analyze, Mosso collaborated with then-Editor-in-Chief of The Steambird to publish articles on Curve.[2] However, the public took the articles literally and wanted Curve destroyed, so in order to protect his creation, he had the paper publish incriminating, falsified evidence on him. This was successful in swaying public opinion onto him and he subsequently died to a Champion Duelist to defend his honor rather than going to trial.
Mosso had a granddaughter Melo Lombroso and passed down his Old Clockwork Locket to her.[3]
Mosso's work would later catch the attention of a Fatui Harbinger (likely Sandrone), who agreed to a collaboration with Jenck; they would help him take over the paper in return for him finding Mosso's inheritance. However, this collaboration ended when Jenck destroyed Curve and most of his papers in an attempt to avoid capture.[4]
