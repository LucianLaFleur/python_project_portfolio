Profile[]
Like many of Efim Snezhevich's subordinates in Inazuma, Tae was raised in the House of the Hearth, an orphanage run by "The Knave" Arlecchino. After growing up, she joined the Fatui and was dispatched as a spy to infiltrate the Royal Bathhouse in Tenshukaku. At some point while working there, the hot springs made her dizzy and she accidentally used her Cryo Delusion inside, giving a guest frostbite and causing the Tenryou Commission to suspect her to be an infiltrator.
She loathes fellow spy Lyudochka Snezhevna for taking the Grand Narukami Shrine position and for the favor Efim regularly shows towards her. While eating out with her, Tae snooped into Lyudochka's purse for spare change and found a light novel — idle leisure that was prohibited from Fatui spies. Aware that Efim was already growing irritated with Lyudochka's intentional stalling, she informed him of the novel, causing him to become enraged and reassign her to Watatsumi Island.
