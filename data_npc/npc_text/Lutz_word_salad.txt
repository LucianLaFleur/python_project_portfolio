Dialogue[]

Lutz: Are you here to send a letter? If so, do you mind if I help you polish it a little?
 A letter?
Lutz: We can deliver letters to almost anyone in Fontaine, as long as you have the Coupons to pay for postage. Though we're practically doing it as charity, if I do say so myself.
Lutz: So would you like to send a letter? If so, please pay for postage first. And also, no queue jumping.
 I can write to anyone?
Lutz: Well, usually we recommend writing to relatives or friends or... uh, joint guarantors, people like that?
Lutz: And though we're operating for the public benefit, we have limited manpower. What is it they say? Resources are not allocated at random...
 Got it, thanks.
Lutz: Oh, don't mention it.
 Not right now.
Lutz: Okay. Well, I'm here, typewriter and pneumatic tube at the ready. You know where to find me.
 Not right now.
Lutz: Okay. Come find me if you need to send any mail.
