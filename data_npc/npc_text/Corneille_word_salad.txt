Dialogue[]

Corneille: Ah, I'm quite curious as to how this will end...
 What sort of end are we talking about?
Corneille: I mean the end of a play, of course!
Corneille: Or... Well, there are some cases that have gone into session several times, but with no result. To be honest, they seem all the same to me.
 That doesn't sound like a very rigorous distinction to me.
Corneille: But does it matter, really? A criminal is a criminal — someone who's done wrong. Any case involving them is sure to become a talking point regardless.
Corneille: And I'm a law-abiding citizen — I'm never going to touch the law's bottom line.
Corneille: Besides, watching trials is a way of studying the law as well.
 See you.
Corneille: Hmm. Let's review the plot again...
