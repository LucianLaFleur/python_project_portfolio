Dialogue[]
Divine Ingenuity[]

Honglang: This Domain... What secrets lie inside it...
 What can you tell me about this Domain's initial appearance?
Honglang: Um, honestly, we can't be sure ourselves.
Paimon: Didn't you say that this place was this big, gloomy, empty room?
Honglang: Well, that was... also something that the team of adventurers "desired," you see.
Honglang: When entering this Domain, each of them only had one thought in mind...
Honglang: "How I wish this place was a space heretofore unexplored by anyone."
Honglang: And so this Domain responded to their desires, turning into something most strange.
Honglang: So as to what this Domain might have originally been like... I suspect that it might have been "nothing at all."
 Is it safe to adventure in here?
Honglang: As long as you do as I instructed, I'm confident that nothing will go wrong.
Honglang: Still, I suggest that you not come into this with any particularly large wishes, just to avoid... you know, any unforeseen results.
 See you.
Honglang: Yes, see you. Do be careful while operating this Domain, now.

Wind Chaser[]

Honglang: Every time there's trouble, they send me to fix it...
 About this Domain...
Honglang: There are a bunch of randomly distributed wind currents in this Domain. Some of them even collide with each other, forming a zone impassable via flight.
Honglang: It's also pretty much impossible to force your way through these wind currents using a wind glider.
Honglang: However, we have also discovered some mechanisms in this Domain. Activating them seems to affect some wind currents...
Honglang: We think that if we can make smart use of these mechanisms, it should make exploring this Domain a heck of a lot easier...
Honglang: However, there's also a bunch of monsters from who-knows-where skulking around in this Domain...
Honglang: So please, take extra care while exploring this Domain, Traveler.
 About yourself...
Honglang: Me? I'm just a regular old adventurer, until Lan put me in charge of exploring unknown Domains of this type... *sigh*
Honglang: She said something about trusting my abilities and believing that I would do great things.
Honglang: But I think she just wanted to find someone who was free to take charge of this thankless task... It could have been anyone!
 Bye.
Honglang: I'll leave exploring this Domain to you while I get your payment ready.
Honglang: Be careful while you explore!

Divine Ingenuity: Collector's Chapter[]

Honglang: Make sure you keep your wits about you in the Domain, Traveler. You might encounter things you don't expect.
Honglang: I need to head back to the guild later. I mean, how am I supposed to get deep into this domain with just a couple of people...
