Dialogue[]

Mengmeng: Eight, nine, ten...
Mengmeng: ...Aw shucks, I've run out of fingers. What do I do now?
 What are you doing?
Mengmeng: Picking flowers!
Mengmeng: I wanna make a flower chain for Yu. We were gonna play together today, but his dad's sick, so he has to watch the tea stand...
Mengmeng: My garland keeps breaking, though. So I keep having to pick new flowers.
 It might be bad to pick so many flowers...
Mengmeng: Ah, I'm sorry, I did a bad thing.
Mengmeng: I'm not good with my hands... I broke a lot of flower stems, and they couldn't be used to make garland...
Mengmeng: ...Well, I guess I'll just give these flowers to you!
Mengmeng: This way, they'll see some use.
(Obtain  Violetgrass ×5)
 Goodbye.
Mengmeng: Bye-bye...
Mengmeng: I need to find a new spot to pick flowers in. If I keep picking these ones, they'll all be gone!
