In the past, during a previous conjunction of the three realms, Koyanagi was invited by his friend to search for the secret treasure of Bunkoku, a "traitor" to Byakuyakoku who supposedly hid an illicit fortune somewhere beneath the Dainichi Mikoshi. The two kept their plans secret from everyone else, and through his friend's hard work, they managed to discover the location of Bunkoku's secret chamber, and eventually solved the puzzle and found the treasure itself.
However, upon their discovery Koyanagi either went mad or was possessed by one of the vengeful spirits said to be guarding the chamber. He ended up killing his friend, and although he seemed to snap out of his madness upon realizing what he had done, he eventually reset Bunkoku's puzzle, believing this would make the treasure become a "mystery for the ages." 
Centuries later, the Traveler finds the same chamber and defeats a vengeful guardian spirit. After defeating it, they free Koyanagi, whose moment of realization after killing his friend was preserved in the form of a Shade of Tokoyo.[1]

Appearance[]
Like most shades, Koyanagi is a translucent humanoid figure without defining physical features.
