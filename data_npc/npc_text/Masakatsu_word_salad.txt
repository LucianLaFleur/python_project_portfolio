Profile[]
A craftsman of unparalled skill, Masakatsu is known for his delicate crafts. When the Vision Hunt Decree was enacted, Masakatsu helped the resistance by creating counterfeit Visions. He became acquainted with Yoimiya after he gave her one of these Visions, saving her from the Tenryou Commission when they came to take it from her.
However, the Commission eventually caught onto the ruse and arrested him for treason, locking him in city's police station, where he was tortured by the guards into a near-death state.
He is eventually broken out of jail by the Traveler and Yoimiya on Ayaka's request. Kujou Sara, who had come to check on him, allowed them to escape with him as she saw he needed urgent care, but warned him that once he recovered, she would bring him back to jail.
