Dialogue[]

Arina: I want some time off... When can I get some time off?
Armin: Don't you like studying here?
Arina: I like studying here! It's just... I'm a little anxious about home...
Armin: It will be okay. Mother and father are taking care of the farm. Nothing will go wrong!
Armin: When we've learned more, we can make money and help them out!
Armin: Then father, mother, you, and Aranara will all live happily ever after.
Arina: You're wrong, Armin. The teachers have said many times that Aranara don't exist.
Arina: We've been going to classes long enough for us to grow up.
Armin: But Vikram told me last time that Aranara do exist...
Arina: What he said was that conceptually, Aranara exist.
Armin: Aren't conceptual Aranara still Aranara?
Arina: Uh... I'm not too sure either. Let's ask the teacher.

Event Dialogue[]
A Parade of Providence[]


Arina: I want a break... Why can't the Akademiya give us some time off during the Extravaganza?
Armin: Don't you enjoy watching the competition?
Arina: No, I do but... If you think about it, we can only watch the competitions if we have a break, right?
Armin: Yeah, that makes sense... Though, watching all my senior classmates represent their Darshans has inadvertently inspired a new drive in me to study!
Armin: I've made up my mind. In the future, I'm going to enter the Interdarshan Championship too!
Arina: Huh... It's a bit early to be thinking about this, isn't it? Didn't our instructors say that seeking knowledge should be a steady and serious endeavor?
Arina: Maybe before considering partaking in a competition that happens once in a blue moon, maybe you should consider which Darshan you want to join first?
