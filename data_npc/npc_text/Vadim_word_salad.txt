Vadim is one of the Fatui assigned to seek the Festering Desire. Judging from his voice-overs, it seems that he was given orders  by Signora.
They have found the Traveler, Sucrose, and the Reckless Pallad in Dragonspine and wishes to take the sword by force along with attempting to kill them for interfering. However, after a short fight, he and his fellow Fatui got defeated.
