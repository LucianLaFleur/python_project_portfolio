Yoimiya explains that there used to be a prosperous merchants' guild in Inazuma, where a group of kids born to the families there would gather. Kouichi and Third Sis were among them. They would learn their family business, and when they grew up, they went their separate ways, with only Kouichi remaining in Inazuma. But whenever one would come back, they would celebrate by watching the Naganohara Fireworks Show.[1]
For Kouichi and Third Sis, fireworks represented friendships, and the moments they shared were eternal.[2]
