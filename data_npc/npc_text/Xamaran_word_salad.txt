Profile[]
Xamaran is a mushroom creature hailing from Sumeru, and has the ability to communicate through the release of spores in the air. It has a certain affinity to The Chasm, specifically Lumenspar, with Paimon and the Traveler being able to energize it by lending it energy from the Lumenstone Adjuvant.
It is said that Xamaran was a name it took up from an old friend in Sumeru,[1] and "Sheeshroom" is a nickname created by Paimon brought about by her surprise that Xamaran could talk.
