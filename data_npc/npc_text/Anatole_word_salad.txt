Vibro-Crystal Verification[]

Anatole: The experimental area is ready. Take these instruction manuals — Patrice was the one who wrote them down...
 Tell me more about the Fontaine Research Institute...
Anatole: Well, the Academy is a research center founded by Alain Guillotin, and its full name is the "Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering." It and the Sumeru Akademiya are very different organizations.
Anatole: We do not exercise any administrative responsibility over the people of Fontaine, as that would be redundant anyway, nor do we aim to educate. As the name may suggest, our focus is on research.
Anatole: Let's just say that the Institute has greatly benefited Fontaine. Some of the clockwork mechanisms and kinetic cores created by Guillotin, who was regarded as a genius, are still being made by many factories today.
Anatole: Haha, but all these things will eventually change, of course.
 So, about the explosion you mentioned...
Anatole: I wasn't in the country at the time, so I can't give you any first-hand information. It seems to have occurred when Senior Technician Edwin Eastinghouse was conducting an experiment using Arkhium that was aimed at dealing with the waterline crisis.
Anatole: The explosion was very terrible indeed, and the incident really put the Institute on the map of Fontaine... To this day, they haven't found all the p... I mean, they haven't found Eastinghouse.
 Alright, let's begin in a bit.
Anatole: Well then. Can Patrice escape the pickle he is currently in? This experiment shall decide that.

Vibro-Crystal Applications[]

Patrice: A way to make money! I've got it!
Patrice: See, if you just attach the Receiver Crystal to the rope-pull mechanism that controls the lighting, all you have to do is activate the Transmitter Crystal from afar and... ta-da! Lights off!
Anatole: The rope-pull mechanism that goes with the Receiver Crystal would cost an absolute fortune.
Patrice: In the early stages of applying new technologies, costs are always high. But once there's demand for it and production takes off, they'll gradually come down.
Anatole: But... Wouldn't it make more sense to just use a longer rope? It'd be cheaper and have exactly the same effect as your mechanism...
Patrice: Uhh... Well, you can also attach the Receiver Crystal to things that you're prone to losing. If you happen to misplace such an item, simply activate the Transmitter Crystal and... voila! Item found again!
Anatole: Great idea! But... what if I lose the Transmitter Crystal?
Patrice: In that case, just attach another Receiver Crystal to your Transmitter Crystal... That way, I'll earn double the money too! You're a genius, Anatole!
Anatole: I'm not sure if I'm a genius, but it's clear that you're nowhere close to deserving that epithet... *sigh* Patrice, think of something practical for once, would you?
Patrice: Uhh...
