Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

Verenata: I have to sort the previously-recorded data... Oh, it's you. Hello there. What can I do for you?
 About your potions...
Verenata: I've recorded the various data gathered from our previous trials. Thanks so much for your help.
Verenata: However, I'm still not sure what happened with that last type of potion... Only the Master Potioneer can tell you that, I'm afraid.
 Do you need any further help?
Verenata: We've completed the trials for three types of potions, so there's not much help needed at the moment...
Verenata: As for the sorting of notes and data, I believe I can handle that myself.
 You've got this!
Verenata: Yes. I will — I want to help more people, and help the Master Potioneer make more effective potions.
 Tell me about Carabosse...
Verenata: Ah, she does often have impressive, curious ideas. She really does know how to use unexpected things as potions ingredients...
Verenata: Her bold, "well, I'm not the one trying the potions regardless" attitude toward formula design is most enviable.
Verenata: There is much I still need to learn from her...

 About the earthquake just a while ago...
Verenata: Agh! The potions I just made! They've all spilled out!
Verenata: We'll have to start back from square one! ... Come on, what was all that shaking just now about, anyway!?
 Hmm... No, it's nothing, really.
Verenata: W—Well, in that case, thanks so much for helping me test the potions! Thank you!

Dialogue Set #2[]

Verenata: Ah, right. While the Master Potioneer is here, I should ask about the effects of some of these ingredients...
Verenata: Hmm? Would you like my help with anything?
 About your potions...
Verenata: Yes. Thanks to your help previously, we were able to obtain much data concerning the Truesight Potion...
Verenata: With that data, I'm sure the Master Potioneer will be able to improve her potions. This is all thanks to you!
 Do you need any further help?
Verenata: We don't have any formulae that need testing at the moment...
Verenata: We do have some notes and data from the previous tests that need sorting, but there aren't that many of those — I can handle them myself.
 You've got this!

 Tell me about Carabosse...
(Same as above)
 Hmm... No, it's nothing, really.

Etymology[]
"Verenata" is the name of the female protagonist in some versions of the French fairytale The Princess Mayblossom.
Incidentally, Carabosse, the Melusine known as the "Master Potioneer" whom Verenata assisted, is named after an evil fairy who poisoned Verenata in the fairytale.
