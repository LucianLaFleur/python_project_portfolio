Idle Quotes[]

 Whoo, so busy...
Media:VO Hiratsuka 01.ogg "Let's see... What else do I have left to do today?"

During Hues of the Violet Garden

 Figured out...
Media:VO Hiratsuka Irodori 01.ogg "There's a ton of work to do for the festival. But I think we've got everything figured out."

Dialogue[]

Hiratsuka: Hello, are you also coming for work here at the Yashiro Commission?
 You are...
Hiratsuka: I'm a staff member at the Yae Publishing House. I'm here to give a budget report.
Hiratsuka: I'm not certain if it is because of slumps in other industries, but there are more and more new authors sending their work to Yae Publishing House...
Hiratsuka: Well, it's a good thing that the publishing industry is booming, but my work is getting busier.
Hiratsuka: If this keeps on going, I won't even have time to visit the Kamisato Clan to chitchat with people...
 What's your job like?
Hiratsuka: My job... it's generally to monitor the content and sales of newly published books each month.
Hiratsuka: Don't assume that it's some easy job. I need to gather various data and come up with operation recommendations for Yae Publishing House's publishing strategy...
Hiratsuka: But our boss doesn't seem to care about these things. Regardless of the profits, the boss only cares about doing things her way...
Hiratsuka: I guess that's just the confidence she has as the Lady Guuji...
 Chitchat?
Hiratsuka: Well, when I come to the Kamisato Clan to meet someone or work, I will take some time to chat with people. It's a good idea to do some networking, after all.
Hiratsuka: So I will sometimes hear about stories in the Kamisato Clan.
Hiratsuka: I've heard that Thoma gets nervous whenever he sees the Commissioner, and that's because the Commissioner often ropes him in into [sic] eating some strange stuff...
Hiratsuka: I really didn't expect the efficient and resolute Commissioner to have such a side to him...
 Goodbye.
Hiratsuka: Yeah, I should probably get back to work as well...
