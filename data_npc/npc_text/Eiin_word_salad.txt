Story[]
At some point, Eiin studied Shinryuu. He once tried to challenge a human-shaped Electro Crystalfly and was defeated in ten seconds.[2]
During Eiin's tenure as Soushu, Okazaki Toraemon and Okazaki Kunihiko were adopted by an Iwakura Art practitioner. Kouzou, Yanagiha Arashi, and Shimada Shichirouji were also members of the clan by this point. At some point, Eiin presumably died and Kouzou took up the position of Soushu.[3][4]
