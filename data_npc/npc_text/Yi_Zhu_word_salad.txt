Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

(Talk to either Yi Xian or Yi Zhu during the day)
Yi Zhu: Come on Yi Xian, there's a good girl. It's home time...
Yi Xian: I'm not going home! I'm going to look for Mommy!
Yi Zhu: But Mommy isn't coming home...
Yi Xian: *sobs* Why won't Mommy come home... Does Mommy not love us anymore?
Yi Zhu: Hey, don't say such silly things...
Yi Xian: But, but... I know I saw the lady with black clothes bring Mommy here... *sobs*
Yi Zhu: Yi Xian, what happened was... Mommy is one of the stars in the sky now.
Yi Xian: You mean Mommy isn't sleeping anymore? ...You're lying, I don't believe you!
Yi Zhu: I'm telling the truth, Yi Xian... Listen, how about we wait till nighttime and I take you up onto the roof? When you see the starlight, you will feel Mommy's loving eyes looking down...

Nighttime[]

Yi Zhu: Hi... Are you looking for me?
 Who are you?
Yi Zhu: I'm Yi Zhu. You probably know my little sister, Yi Xian?
Yi Zhu: With the house so empty these days, I'm worried Yi Xian'll get lonely. So I thought I'd buy her a new toy, see if it takes her mind off things.
Yi Zhu: Changshun was so understanding, she said I could pick one toy to take back home for free. Everyone's been so good to me and my sister... *sniff*
Yi Zhu: ...
Yi Zhu: *sniff* ...No, I can't cry...I can't let Yi Xian see me unhappy.
 About Rex Lapis' death...
Yi Zhu: Shh, please don't. Sorry, it's just... Please don't say the 'd' word again. Especially not in front of my sister.
Yi Zhu: I don't care much for the news. Right now, all I care about is seeing my sister smile again.
 See you.
Yi Zhu: Bye.

Event Dialogue[]
Lantern Rite[]

(Talk to either Yi Xian or Yi Zhu during the day)
Yi Xian: ...Mommy always used to take us to Xiao Market...
Yi Zhu: Yeah! Mommy would buy toys for us, take us to see the Xiao Lanterns... And she'd carry you when you got tired...
Yi Xian: ...Yi Zhu, I miss Mommy.
Yi Zhu: Yi Xian... Don't cry, let's make a Xiao Lantern for Mommy, shall we?
Yi Xian: Huh? But I thought Xiao Lanterns were to remember the heroes who look after us...
Yi Zhu: You're right. Well, our mommy was a hero and she looked after us, didn't she?
Yi Zhu: So come on, wipe your tears away — let's welcome back Mommy's spirit and all the other heroes with big smiles on our faces!
Yi Xian: Alright!


(Talk to Yi Zhu during nighttime)
Yi Zhu: Hi... Are you looking for me?
 Who are you?
Yi Zhu: I'm Yi Zhu. You probably know my little sister, Yi Xian?
Yi Zhu: I promised Yi Xian that we would make a Xiao Lantern together for Mommy, but I couldn't gather the materials we needed. Thankfully Changshun specially set aside some materials for us to use...
Yi Zhu: Everyone's been so good to me and my sister... *sniff*
Yi Zhu: ...
Yi Zhu: *sniff* ...No, I can't cry... I can't let Yi Xian see me unhappy.
 Goodbye.
Yi Zhu: Goodbye... May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished.

Fleeting Colors in Flight[]

(Talk to either Yi Xian or Yi Zhu during the day)
Yi Xian: Yi Zhu, I miss Mommy again... I wanna accompany her to see the Xiao Market...
Yi Zhu: Don't cry, Xian... I'll go with you this year, alright?
Yi Zhu: Let's go buy some toys, check out the Xiao Lanterns, and watch the fireworks. I'll carry you on my back if you get tired.
Yi Xian: Yi Zhu... *sobs*
Yi Xian: Then... will you teach me how to make Xiao Lanterns this year? I'd like to make Mommy one.
Yi Zhu: Of course I can. We made one for her together last year. This year, I'll teach you, and you'll be able to make one yourself!
Yi Xian: Yep!
Yi Zhu: When Mommy sees your Xiao Lantern, her spirit will return, together with all those other heroes. Then, we'll welcome her back with big smiles on our faces!
Yi Xian: Yeah!


(Talk to Yi Zhu at night.)
Yi Zhu: Hi...Are you looking for me?
 And you are?
Yi Zhu:  I'm Yi Zhu.  I suppose you might've seen my little sister, Yi Xian?
Yi Zhu: I promised her that we'd spend Lantern Rite together and that I'd teach her to make a Xiao Lantern for our mother.
Yi Zhu: I was preparing some materials, but I didn't expect Miss Changsun to specially give us some...
Yi Zhu: So I've made her one as well. I hope she likes it.
Yi Zhu: Everyone's been taking good care of my sister and I lately.  I'm really grateful.
 See you around, kid.
Yi Zhu: Goodbye...May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished.

Trivia[]
The siblings' names are most likely a reference to The Inlaid Harp (Chinese: 锦瑟 Jǐnsè), a poem composed by Li Shangyin, a poet and politician during the 9th century.
The second verse of the poem is 一弦一柱思华年 which loosely translates to "Each string (yixian), each bridge (yizhu) [of this fifty-string harp] makes me recall the glorious days of my youth [with my beloved one]."
Reinterpreting the verse while treating 一弦 yīxián, "one string" and 一柱 yīzhù, "one bridge" as names results in this possible interpretation: "Yi Xian and Yi Zhu yearn for their happy days."
Their names may be based on a viral story of a man who named his children Yi Xian and Yi Zhu after his wife Nianhua passed away since the verse may also be interpreted as "Yi Xian and Yi Zhu miss [their mother] Nianhua."
