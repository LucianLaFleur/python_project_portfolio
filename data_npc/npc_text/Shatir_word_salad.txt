 What a waste!
Media:VO Shatir 01.ogg "Those closed-door research projects are a complete waste of money!"

During A Parade of Providence

 Blowing research funds...
Media:VO Shatir A Parade of Providence 01.ogg "Don't tell me they're blowing all of our new research funds on the Interdarshan Championship..."

Thoughts[]
Shatir's thoughts can be accessed by using Nahida's Elemental Skill, All Schemes to Know.

Media:VO Shatir All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Shatir: (Hmph, hopefully those earmarked funds were actually spent somewhere useful.)
Dialogue[]

Shatir: It's not fair. All those secret research projects are sucking up budgets that should be ours.
 Budget?
Shatir: Yeah, the budgets.
Shatir: Sadly, even great things like knowledge can be thwarted by money.
Shatir: The Akademiya has been spending more and more budgets on classified research over the past years.
Shatir: Instead of maintaining a financial black hole, they should fund more practical disciplines like archaeology.
Shatir: With a lack of self-reflection on history, we would get a short end in real life sooner or later.
Shatir: Next time I apply for funding, I must get Vikram to join me!
 About Vikram...
Shatir: Vikram is my friend. He must be your friend, too.
Shatir: You know how it is. As long as he's there helping with the negotiations, you can always get more funding than you expected.
 I've only heard the name.
Shatir: What? You don't know about him? Hm... Well, he has been busy recently with the thing about the next Grand Conservator.
 It's my first time hearing this name.
Shatir: What? There are people in Sumeru City who haven't heard of Vikram? Well... Maybe I'm the one who's taking it for granted, since I haven't met anyone who didn't know of him.
Shatir: He's been in the limelight recently, and is a strong candidate for the next Grand Conservator.
Shatir: I don't know what other people think, but other than Lisa, who according to legends has become Mondstadt's Grand Conservator, Vikram should be the most suitable candidate.
Shatir: After all, if the person in charge of the collections is as unreasonable as the one managing the funds, this study will be dead in the water.
 See you.
Shatir: Goodbye.

Event Dialogue[]
A Parade of Providence[]

Shatir: A pity that knowledge so great is constrained by matters of Mora...
Shatir: And when there are wealthy sponsors, the wealth is not fed into valuable research but rather burned on frivolous competitions...
Shatir: You mean the sponsor? Hm... I haven't heard much about them, but they should be a good person.
Shatir: Even merchants who think of nothing but profit should not be judged with prejudice so long as they are willing to place emphasis on the development and preservation of knowledge.
Shatir: ...Because, when it comes down to it, almost anything is better than someone who wastes money.

Trivia[]
Although he does not wear his school crest, it can be assumed that Shatir is a researcher of the Vahumana Darshan given his interest for archaeology and concerns about the Akademiya's lack of self-reflection on history.
