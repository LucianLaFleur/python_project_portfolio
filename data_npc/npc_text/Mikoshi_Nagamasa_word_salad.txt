  Mentioned Characters 




Mikoshi Nagamasa (Japanese: 御輿長正 Mikoshi Nagamasa) was one of The Yougou Three in Inazuma who lived around the time of the cataclysm 500 years ago.
In his youth, he was adopted into the Mikoshi Clan by Mikoshi Chiyo and lived with her biological son Iwakura Michihiro (Mikoshi Michihiro). Nagamasa took great pride in his adoptive family, and after Chiyo went mad from abyssal corruption and turned her blade on Ei, he joined the Inazuma Shogunate to restore his family's honor.
After becoming an Inspector, Nagamasa took up bladesmithing at Tatarasuna. There, he forged a nagamaki that would come to be known as the Katsuragikiri Nagamasa (Katsuragi-Slashing Nagamasa) after he slew his yoriki, Katsuragi, with it.

...Nagamasa is harsh, but also knows right from wrong. But even so, he is not amenable to reason. His name indicates one obsessed with purity...—Miyazaki's remarks about Nagamasa following Katsuragi and Nozomu's deaths[2]

Story[]
Early life[]
At some point in Nagamasa's early life, he was fostered by the oni maiden Chiyo and grew up alongside her biological son, Michihiro.[3] He appears to have lived in or around the Mt. Yougou area, later going to learn under the Yougou Tengu and becoming one of the Yougou Three alongside Asase Hibiki and Kamuna Harunosuke.[4]
After Chiyo was corrupted by the abyss and betrayed Ei during the fight against the dark forces of the cataclysm, Michihiro secluded himself in Konda Village out of shame while Nagamasa left to join the Shogunate and restore the Mikoshi name.[4][5]

As an Inspector[]
After becoming an inspector, Nagamasa went to Tatarasuna with his yoriki Katsuragi. There, he developed an interest in weaponsmithing, a pursuit that the rest of his group — consisting of Vice Armory Officer Miyazaki, Nozomu, and Kinjiro — believed had a beneficial effect on his temperament. With Katsuragi and Miyazaki's help, Nagamasa forged a nagamaki he named Daitatara Nagamasa (Japanese: 大たたら長正 "Great Tatara Nagamasa").[3]
Around the same time, Katsuragi found a puppet inside a hidden palace called Shakkei Pavilion — Ei's prototype puppet, the entity later known as Scaramouche.[6] He introduced the young man to Nagamasa, who in turn introduced him to the Armory Officer Niwa Hisahide and other workers at Tatarasuna. The puppet was accepted as one of their own, and was called "Kabukimono."[7] It's likely that Nagamasa and Katsuragi were the only two who knew that Kabukimono was not the lost man from Nazuchi Beach, as they told others, and Nagamasa agreed to conceal his past because of Katsuragi's wish.[6] He apologized to Kabukimono that he had to deal with him in this fashion.[8][Note 1]
On the completion of the Daitatara Nagamasa, Nozomu was so moved upon seeing the blade that he made a painting of it, while Katsuragi and Kabukimono performed a sword dance together.[2]

Tatarasuna Mystery[]
The tragedy began when a mechanic from Fontaine calling himself "Escher" appeared, working with the Akame Clan — another clan of the Isshin Art sansaku — to revolutionize the smelting process at Mikage Furnace. "Escher" was actually Il Dottore, dispatched on a mission by Pierro to cause chaos at Tatarasuna and lay the groundwork for a future endeavor. Taking an interest in the puppet, Dottore decided to make him the key player in his experiment at Tatarasuna and his smelting process, though highly effective, was actually releasing the Tatarigami inside Crystal Marrow into the environment. As workers grew sick and died from the curse's effects, people began to panic and Niwa implemented an information blackout to control the situation.[9][10]
Both Niwa and Nagamasa suspected Escher from the start, and likely held an investigation against him. However, Nagamasa took a more cautious approach, so he was too late and Escher had killed Niwa, and created a story that Niwa fled Tatarasuna instead.[9]
The kabukimono returned from his expedition empty-handed, unaware that Ei had already retreated to the Plane of Euthymia while he was barred from visiting the Shogun. Viewing Yae Miko's promise to send aid as a sign that the Shogunate had turned their backs on them, the kabukimono returned only to discover that Niwa had gone missing. Dottore convinced him and the people of Tatarasuna that Niwa had abandoned them to their fates, and that their only hope lay in the kabukimono. Taking the device with him, the kabukimono managed to survive the ordeal of absorbing the filth. Afterwards, "Escher" bid him to open the device, where he found a withered heart — which Dottore claimed was from a subordinate of Niwa's whom Niwa had killed. The kabukimono, believing that Niwa had betrayed him and the people at Tatarasuna, was enraged and came to view this incident as the "second betrayal" that he experienced.[10][11] The Kabukimono left Tatarasuna, and the remain swordsmiths were unable to find him.[2]
After Hisahide's "disappearance", the responsibility for what had happened fell to the second-in-command Nagamasa. Still vowing to clean his clan name, Nagamasa could not allow himself to die. Katsuragi was willing to face capital punishment in place of his master, and thus Nagamasa cleaved Katsuragi with the Daitatara Nagamasa before throwing the blade into the furnace. Nozomu disagreed with the order and reached into the furnace to retrieve the melted blade, later dying from his injuries. Kinjiro took the remains of the blade as well as Nozomu's painting and hid them in the Arsenal.[2] From then on, both Nagamasa and his blade became known as Katsuragikiri Nagamasa (Japanese: 桂木斬長正 "Katsuragi-Slashing Nagamasa").[3]

Later life[]
According to Sawada, Nagamasa survived the ordeal and continued to live until his old age.[12]

Legacy[]
At some point in his life, Nagamasa authored the Anthology of Inazuman Blades, in which he named Hasui Geppaku Futsu and Haran Geppaku Futsu as the masterpieces of the Futsu School,[13] one of the five bladesmithing traditions of the Raiden Gokaden.[14]

Revised History[]
During the events of Archon Quest The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call in Interlude Chapter: Act III - Inversion of Genesis, Scaramouche learns the truth behind Niwa's death, taken from Dottore's own memories which Lesser Lord Kusanali previously connected to while she was verifying that he had eliminated his segments. After assuming from the Traveler's gesture that it was possible to change the past, Scaramouche decided to erase his own existence using the remaining divine power he had. In reality, it is not possible to change the past, instead only written history and people's memory — that are, people's perception — were tampered to erase his names. It appeared that to not make a hole in people's perception, the Irminsul replaced Scaramouche with various equivalent figures throughout history.
In Tatarasuna Mystery, the kabukimono was "replaced" by a mysterious "foreign mechanic", which seemed to be the combination of the kabukimono and the foreign mechanic Escher from the old history. Thus, Nagamasa did not meet the puppet, but otherwise his story remained the same.

↑ It's likely that the Plume of Luxury depicted the past events in the chronological order, which means Nagamasa apologizing to Kabukimono happened before the Tatarasuna Mystery.
