Dialogue[]

Shevirme: More wine and meat free you from worries!
Shevirme: Of course, you can't drink too much, or you'll make a fool of yourself.
 And you are...
Shevirme: I own a stall here selling drinks, snacks, and stuff like that.
Shevirme: My food is reasonably priced. A popular choice for student meals, welcome parties, and team-building alike!
Shevirme: And I even got the Mahamata among my clients, too! One bought a whole case of wine!
 Sounds like a heavy drinker.
Shevirme: Haha, I actually have no idea what he does, but folks say he's a Mahamata.
Shevirme: He was tall and looked like a guy who could hold his drink. But I couldn't tell if he bought the wine for himself or for someone else...
Shevirme: I remember him murmuring something like "one case should be enough for an apology" as he carried the wine.
Shevirme: ...Say, maybe he wanted to get someone drunk so that they'll forget his mistakes?
 Make a fool of myself?
Shevirme: That's right. Now, don't tell anyone, but this happened a few days ago. Two groups of researchers were drinking the tavern and they ended up fighting.
Shevirme: Y'know, those researchers are usually so reserved and polite, even eating roast meat with small bites. But they can also really go at it, huh?
Shevirme: I think it was a fight over who is the best candidate for the Grand Conservator position. They started arguing, then fists flew. Soon, the matra came and took them all away.
Shevirme: Looks like no matter how well-read you are, you still succumb to a few glasses of alcohol, eh?
 See you.
Shevirme: See you around!

Trivia[]
The Mahamata mentioned in Shevirme's dialogue is likely Alhaitham, who is a member of the Mahamata due to his role as the Scribe. Part of the incessant feuding between Alhaitham and his roommate, Kaveh, is over drinks, which Kaveh cannot afford due to his financial situation; it is also brought up on the Puspa Café Message Board and the Mahamata Bulletin Board.
