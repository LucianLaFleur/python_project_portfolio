Profile[]
Baizhu's master was a member of the Hu Family and was once a member of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. He was the most recent doctor in a line of doctors who bore Changsheng's "Way of the Dragon-Dragging Jade Snake" contract before the current bearer, Baizhu.

Appearance[]
Baizhu's master had physical features resembling his great-niece Hu Tao, sporting short brown hair and red eyes,[Note 1] though during the duration of his contract with Changsheng he had her golden snake eyes. He wore brown clothing similar to that worn by the undertakers of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor with a white coat on top.  He also wore a monocle.

Story[]
When he was younger, Baizhu's master traveled to Chenyu Vale with his brother, at which they would meet a pharmacist. After that encounter, Baizhu's master announced that he wanted to leave the family business to practice medicine, sparking an argument with his older brother.  Failing to convince him to stay, the two fell out and never spoke to each other again.[1] Baizhu's master would go on to become the successor to Changsheng's "Way of the Dragon-Dragging Jade Snake" contract. Like those who bore the contract before him, he was incredibly selfless and did not prioritize his own well-being, opting to frequently use Changsheng's powers to exchange his life force with his patients.
At some point, he took on Jiangli as a disciple.[2]
While Baizhu was still young, his master was practicing medicine in his hometown when a plague suddenly struck. Although able to contain the spread, Baizhu's parents passed away during the plague. Having lost both his parents, Baizhu began to follow his master in learning medicine.[3]
Not long after taking on Baizhu as a disciple, Jiangli left their master to treat her husband, Jialiang, distancing herself from her master to keep him from using his life force to save him.[4] Saving Jialiang would become his dying wish.[5]
Eventually, like those who bore Changsheng's contract before him, Baizhu's master ended up dying at a young age, passing on the contract to Baizhu. 

Legacy[]
The loss of his master combined with the cruel reality of the fate borne by both Changsheng and her hosts is what caused Baizhu to pursue immortality, hoping to be the final bearer of the contract that had taken the lives of so many doctors before him; those whom Baizhu considers "least deserving of death". This resolve became the catalyst for Baizhu receiving his Vision, appearing on his master's grave when he vowed that the contract would end with him.
Baizhu's research on Qiqi allowed him to turn Jialiang into a zombie after dying, somewhat fulfilling his master's dying wish to save him.

However, although the ancient prescriptions were compiled by our ancestors and have stood the test of time, we mustn't also forget to look forward. Times have changed, and so have our surroundings and customs. Treatments that were effective in the bygone times may not prove to be as effective now. Clinging to the classic prescriptions of the past may not ultimately serve the best interest of the patients nowadays.More about Baizhu: II Media:VO_Baizhu More About Baizhu - 02.ogg Media:VO ZH_Baizhu More About Baizhu - 02.ogg Media:VO JA_Baizhu More About Baizhu - 02.ogg Media:VO KO_Baizhu More About Baizhu - 02.ogg If you're looking for some kind of thrilling story, I'm afraid I don't have one. Even when I was studying medicine under my late Master, I didn't experience any particularly dire situations. My master saw that I had a good head on my shoulders, had me swear a simple oath, and took me in... That's all there was to it.More about Baizhu: IV Media:VO_Baizhu More About Baizhu - 04.ogg Media:VO ZH_Baizhu More About Baizhu - 04.ogg Media:VO JA_Baizhu More About Baizhu - 04.ogg Media:VO KO_Baizhu More About Baizhu - 04.ogg I understand my master's intentions. He hoped that I would be able to put myself more in the patients' shoes, and not ever be swayed by external factors. *sigh* He really did have a compassionate heart, and was always ready to sacrifice himself for others. It's unfortunate that he passed so early and never had the chance to live his years to their fullest.
Trivia[]
Mr. Bai falsely claimed to be Baizhu's master, under the alias "Dr. Baifuzi", in order to scam Captain Wu. Aunt Zhang and Guangzhi were aware of this as they knew Baizhu's true master has already passed away.[6]
