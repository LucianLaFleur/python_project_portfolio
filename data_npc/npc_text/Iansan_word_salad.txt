Appearance
Iansan is a small girl with dark skin, long ears and light green eyes. She has long gray hair, which she keeps pulled back into pigtails. She also appears to have white body painting near her nose and on both her shoulders.
Iansan wears an orange-and-black headband decorated with an animal skull. She wears a detailed orange, purple, and black jacket over an undershirt, along with a beaded necklace decorated with feathers resembling a dream-catcher. Iansan also has rings on her fingers and long black socks.

Trivia
Iansan's name may have been a reference to the orisha Ọya (also known as Ọya-Ìyáńsàn-án, Yansã, or Iansan), a deity in Yoruba mythology as well as Afro-Latin-American traditional religions such as Candomblé or Santería. She is a warrior goddess who governs fire, storms, lightning, hurricanes, death, and rebirth.
Ọya is often associated with the color purple, which appears as an accent in Iansan's design.
In addition to presiding over death and rebirth, Ọya also is said to rule over the realm of the dead and live at the entrances of graveyards.
