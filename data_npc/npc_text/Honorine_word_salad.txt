Dialogue[]

Honorine: Ah, I'd love to bet on that! Otherwise, I'd be letting myself down.
 You are...?
Honorine: Call me Honorine, an unlucky Fontainian engineer. The aquabus project I was involved in was halted due to an accident, leaving me... "stranded," you could say.
Honorine: If you come across an engineer named Hautemontagne, do say hello to her for me.
 Bet on what?
Honorine: My salary and safety, of course! I'd love to hire an Eremite band to escort me into the desert... but it feels like a terrible risk no matter which way I slice it!
 To the desert?
Honorine: A certified engineer such as myself, repairing little clockwork meka day in, day out. What kind of sense does that make?
Honorine: The moment I think upon those magnificent Khaenri'ahn machines, my heart flies upon those thoughts into the depths of the desert...
Honorine: My regression is unbearable, but the progress of my colleagues by contrast burns my heart all the more! Ah, Hautemontagne's research in Liyue is progressing in leaps and bounds, surely!
Honorine: Ahh! I must, I must go into the desert!
 Risky, you say?
Honorine: Of course! This is the Eremites we speak of, you know! You're an adventurer. I'm sure you've met many a fool nabbed by Eremite bands!
Honorine: I do so dearly wish to visit the desert and witness Khaenri'ahn machines for myself, but I have no desire to become such a laughingstock!
Honorine: In fact, I would land myself in even hotter waters were I to accidentally hire an outlaw.
Honorine: Ugh, how shall I get to the desert...
 Goodbye.
Honorine: See you. Ah, I should just take the gamble...
