Profile[]
Taj is a member of the Matra and had a single son, Murtada Radkani. They had a brief argument but were able to reconcile, before Murtada was enticed by someone to investigate the Court of Desolation, which had been banned by the Akademiya due to the dangers tied to it. Taj arrested Murtada and threw him in jail, although he committed suicide shortly after arriving in prison, much to Taj's sorrow.
Taj worked with his junior, Cyno, but retired from partaking in live missions due to personal reasons a year prior to the events of the quest, and instead relegated himself to administrative duties. When he learned that the organization that had killed his son had been researching the Court of Desolation, Taj investigated them and learned that they had many famous members in their ranks, including the Akademiya. Pretending to have fallen from grace, Taj worked with them while leaving behind a trail for Cyno to follow, although the Traveler would be the one to find it. Fortunately, the Traveler ran into Cyno, who was likewise investigating a surplus of smuggled Canned Knowledge which was an unintended result of Taj's actions.
He eventually found the Court of Desolation and began damaging its walls to allow quicksand to bury it, knowing that the organization could not continue to use it for their own gains. By the time the Traveler and Cyno learned that Taj was responsible for the leaks in the Akademiya, he had been waiting for their arrival. After a brief fight, Cyno realized that Taj had not gone astray, which he confirmed. Hoping to see his son in the afterlife and needing to atone for the leaks, Taj willingly let himself be buried by quicksand.
Cyno would later clear Taj's name, with the announcement of his sacrifice shocking his fellow Matra, who were riled up and arrested the traitors in the Akademiya on the list he complied. Some would escape, but they would all be caught by Cyno. While the Matra wanted to erect a memorial at the place he died, Cyno did not reveal the location due to the circumstances involved.
