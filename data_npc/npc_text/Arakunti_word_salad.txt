Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

Arakunti: Sound of cooking~ Sound of making puzzles~ And sounds of chasing~ Noisy and messy, but this is how Festival Utsava sounds~
 About Festival Utsava...
Arakunti: We meet again, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Arakunti: Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) is singing at Festival Utsava, right? That must sound like sunshine and moonlight mixed together, sky and water pool overlapping, and dewdrops and raindrops shaking hands.
Arakunti: Sing with Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), Paimon. No slacking off.
 Goodbye.
Arakunti: Bye, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).

Dialogue Set #2[]

Arakunti: Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)'s songs sound golden, just like the warm sun. Arakunti keeps that in mind.
 About singing...
Arakunti: Arakunti heard the songs of Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Brave, and full of hope.
Arakunti: Just like Nara Varuna, in the stories.
Arakunti: But Nara Varuna never returns to Vanarana. Please come visit, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
 Goodbye.
Arakunti: Yes... Promise to come back, please, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
