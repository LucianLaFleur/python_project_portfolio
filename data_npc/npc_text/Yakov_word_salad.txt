Profile[]
Yakov is a Fatui member; in his youth, his mother died early, leaving him with only his father. During an operation, his father sacrificed his life to ensure that he could escape, and Yakov learned of his fate shortly afterwards and was given his insignia as a memento.
Yakov proceeded to join a group of Fatui that agreed to work with Persikov regarding his machine that could manipulate memories, although the test backfired. Yakov argued with Chevka over honor before throwing his insignia away and going mad from the machine. After resolving the issue with the machine, the Traveler found the insignia and Chekov, tracking Yakov to the camp Alice had set up a year prior for Klee. Chevkov's attempts to bring Yakov back to his senses failed, so he brought him back to the main camp at the center of the isle.
The Traveler also found and restored both Agafya and Zakhar, who likewise returned to camp. They unsuccessfully tried to restore Yakov's mind, before the Traveler learned they had thrown away some strange conches as they had believed them to be ordinary. After finding them and placing them back at the camp, Yakov was reminded of family and his mind was restored. He was surprised to see the Traveler and Paimon, but nonetheless thanked them for saving him before he left with his comrades.
