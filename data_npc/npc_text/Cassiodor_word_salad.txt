Profile[]
Cassiodor was a warrior and servant of the king Remus. He originated from the same tribe as Erinnyes, until it was destroyed by the encroaching armies of Remuria and its people enslaved—he and Erinnyes were the only tribespeople who escaped this fate. During the war, Cassiodor met Boethius, a Harmost of Remuria, and defected to the side of the empire. Cassiodor eventually rose to become a Harmost himself,[6] and two men came to regard each other as brothers.[citation needed] Cassiodor survived the destruction of Remuria's capital, as he was outside the kingdom at the time.[7]

Personality[]
Cassiodor is a man of good heart, a perceptive nature and a strong sense of wit and reason. As someone from a tribe Remuria had conquered himself, Cassiodor was hesitant to embark on the empire's path of conquest and destroy the "barbarian tribes" of Fontaine, which prompted the more fanatical Boethius to accuse him of having a soft heart.[8]. Despite this, his soft heart was what ultimately saved the life of Este the Quick-Witted and other Remurians, and his loyalty would ultimately be rewarded.
He found his title of "Golden Hunter" to be humiliating, although the reason why has not been explained.[5]

Story[]
History[]
Cassiodor was born and raised in the same tribe as Erinnyes, and was the only other survivor of Remuria's campaign alongside her. Where Erinnyes would not bow to them and left to the side of Egeria, Cassiodor would join the Remurians, becoming close friends with Boethius. After some time, Remus would make Cassiodor a Harmost, and at some point, Cassiodor would 'ascend' with the rest of the Remurians into their new forms. 
Despite being a Harmost, Cassiodor held reservations about destroying the "barbarian tribes" of Fontaine, in turn being accused of having a soft heart. However, it was this soft heart that made him so effective, as he was inevitably entrusted by Remus with the solemn duty of guarding Remuria after its fall. On the day Remuria fell, he was not in the capitol, having been sent to escort certain Remurians - including Este the Quick-Witted - to the safety of Fontaine. 
Following the fall, Cassiodor would take on many forms to fulfil his duty via possession.

Present Day[]
(To be added.)

Legacy[]
Due to leading Este the Quick-Witted to Fontaine in the past, the young Remurian would eventually have a family. Este's descendant of the same name would ultimately become the person that would guide the Traveler and Paimon to Cassiodor, with the young man also coming to take care of Osse once Cassiodor left his body.

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
Cassiodor's name may be a reference to Cassiodorus, a Roman scholar of antiquity.
