Profile[]
During the time of the calamity, in which the original Vanarana was destroyed by the Withering, Araja sacrificed his physical form and became the Tree of Dreams, creating the dream realm of Mahavanaranapna, where his people could live in peace, undisturbed by Sumeru's devastation and the bad Nara. While his physical body can't move anymore, Araja's mind remained intact and can manifest a body inside his dream.
Over the last 500 years, Araja has lost much of his old memories, but it's known that he participated in the last Festival Utsava and was close friends with Araji, Arapacati and Aramuhukunda.

Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Before completing the Aranyaka quest series)
Araja: Oh, it's Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). Do you have any questions for me?
 Do you need a hand with anything?
Araja: Oh, thank you, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler). As you can see, I'm doing rather well.
 Are any Aranara in need of help?
Araja: Oh, well... Go to the center of Vanarana, and you should see Arapacati there. Something has been troubling her lately.
(Starts An Unwavering Culinary Dream quest series)
 Is there anything else to be done for Festival Utsava?
Araja: About that, Arakavi should be at the center of Vanarana. I think he's also in need of help for Festival Utsava.
(Starts Encounter in the Woods quest series)
 About "Marana"...
Araja: That's a story from very long ago...
Araja: A long time ago, Aranara walked the earth and made friends with Nara and all living creatures. There was no Marana then. Until a disaster that occurred many, many moons ago...
Araja: Greater Lord Rukkhadevata returned to Sarva, and the Marana's rampage through the earth began. Once the forest recovered its vitality, the Aranara hid the real Vanarana in a dream to protect themselves.
Araja: The forest didn't know death, until a day came when the trees realized that withered flowers and dead animals covered the earth.
Araja: On the same day, the earth remembered the dark, poisonous blood it had once devoured, or was about to devour. The rivers thought of the descent of the sun, evaporating all water and leaving a red world behind.
Araja: They realized that all things would meet their end, and so, Marana was born. It is the name of death, and those who know it shall die.
Araja: Marana urges everything towards death. As for the tall, dark, and warped beings, they are the avatars chosen by Marana, the heralds of death.
Araja: Of course. In my stories, Marana's Avatar takes many forms. Sometimes beasts, sometimes birds, sometimes Nara, sometimes blight...
Araja: But stories are just stories, and they aren't my memories.
 About the Vasoma Fruit...
Araja: It's a fruit full of energy. It grows on the memories and dreams in the earth, and it needs the help of Aranara and Nara to bear fruit.
Araja: A Bija can be formed by feeding a Vasoma Fruit to the Ashvattha Tree. It's a great tree planted by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, and it's the origin of Aranara.
 About the Aranyaka...
Araja: It belonged to Nara Varuna. (‍SheSheText for male Traveler/HeHeText for female Traveler‍) was a Golden Nara who was kind, brave, and honest, just like you.
Araja: I still remember how the Aranara of that time missed (‍herherText for male Traveler/himhimText for female Traveler‍) and loved (‍hishisText for male Traveler/herherText for female Traveler‍) stories. But I believe that since Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) is here now...
 See you.
Araja: Yes. I look forward to celebrating Festival Utsava with you.

 About the Aranyaka...
Araja: Nara Varuna left this, and Arama is giving it to you. Arama thinks he did the right thing.
Araja: It filled with stories between you and Aranara, right? Araja knows that Nara will forget about how to dream, and forget about us.
Araja: However, as long as the Aranyaka keeps the records or our stories and names, you can always read it without the memories about Aranara.
Araja: When that day comes, Araja hopes that you will find these stories interesting and touching.
 About Arama...
Araja: Araja missed him very much. With Arama turning into the new Ashvattha, Araja's dreams have become quieter.

 About Arana...
Araja: Arana is also an ancient Aranara, with so many blooms and rainfall captured in memories.

Araja: Araja heard that, Arana and Narana went traveling together. All the stories and beautiful things on the trip, hopefully, will make up for Arana's loss.
 Goodbye.
