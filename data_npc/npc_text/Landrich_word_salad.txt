Story[]
Aristocratic Period[]
Landrich was the head of his clan, though which clan he led is unknown. He organized the Dragonspine expedition party, including his illegitimate son Eberhart, though he did not take part himself. Though he planned on granting Eberhart legitimacy upon the party's successful return, he was unaware that Eberhart had plans of rebellion. Using traps, tricks, and his manipulative personality, Eberhart caused the deaths of the rest of his party, though he was grievously wounded during his attempt to kill Ingbert and the author of the Ancient Investigation Journals, Luther. According to Luther, Landrich's original purpose for the expedition was to accomplish a great achievement in order to quell the arrogance of those wanting to rebel.[1]
What happened to Eberhart is unknown, but regardless of his fate, Landrich was likely among the aristocrats exiled from Mondstadt following Vennessa's rebellion.
