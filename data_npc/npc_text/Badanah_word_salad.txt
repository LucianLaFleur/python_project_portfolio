Story[]
Badanah was a descendant of the Verdant Lord, Zumurud, who was the son of Muzaffar, one of the Twenty-Nine Deys of Orghana (the city now known as Port Ormos). The inscriptions found around the Great Red Sand seem to contradict each other on Badanah's ancestry; one inscription claims Badanah was one of Zumurud's fifty sons (assuming the line is meant to be read literally),[1] while another claims that "[Badanah's] father is most beloved of the Verdant Lord," which indicates that Badanah was not Zumurud's direct descendant. Regardless, Badanah had a full brother named Muzzudin,[1] and at least another fourteen brothers (or male relatives) who would later all make claims to the throne following his death.[2]
A later inscription found south of Abdju Pit is a panegyric which praises Badanah, who by that time was a king, and claims that he is wiser than Muzzudin was.
