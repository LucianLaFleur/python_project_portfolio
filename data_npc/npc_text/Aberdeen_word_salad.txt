Dialogue[]

Aberdeen: If I can just avoid the Forest Rangers...
 What are you planning?
Aberdeen: As an adventurer, the greatest plan is of course to travel every inch of the world and explore every secret this world has to offer!
Aberdeen: So, based on this goal of mine, I've decided to conquer Avidya Forest first!
 First...
Aberdeen: Ahem, what? I admit that I'm a novice, but every novice has to take their first step, right?
Aberdeen: I heard cute Fungi live in the rainforest, and there are tiny forest cats and mysterious treasures...
Aberdeen: Hehe, it sounds so exciting!
Aberdeen: The only obstacle between me and my grand adventure is those annoying Forest Rangers. If I can just avoid them, then I can...
 I hope you drop that thought...
Aberdeen: If that's your thought, you are not exactly "adventurous."
Aberdeen: Listen, to be the greatest adventurer, you must be ambitious and ready to take risks.
(Obtain  Wanderer's Advice ×6)
 Bye.
Aberdeen: Bye! Maybe our next meeting will be in somewhere else!
