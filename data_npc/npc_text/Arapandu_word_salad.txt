Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

Arapandu: Golden Nara always helps Aranara out of trouble, too bad there are too few Golden Nara.
 About Golden Nara...
Arapandu: Arapandu has seen many Nara, a lot of bad Nara, they are tall and suspicious.
Arapandu: But Golden Nara, not many. Only Nara Varuna, and Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
 About Vimara Village...
Arapandu: Strange things at Vimara Village, Arana knows.
Arapandu: But she is using Ararakalari, to protect Narana. After Festival Utsava, you can try finding the answer.
 Goodbye.
Arapandu: Bye, Golden Nara.

Dialogue Set #2[]

Arapandu: Varuna Contraption, with the sun shining; and (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) Contraption, with the moon shining?
 What are you talking about?
Arapandu: Ah, it's Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
Arapandu: Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) healed Varuna Contraption, so the trees and seeds are lively again.
Arapandu: That's why we are naming Varuna Contraption as (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) Contraption, to show our thanks.
Arapandu: But that would break Nara Varuna's heart, if Nara Varuna comes back.
Arapandu: So Arapandu is trying to make Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) and Nara Varuna happy together.
 Goodbye.
Arapandu: Hmm, hard to name it. Arapandu will tell Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) when the name is ready.
