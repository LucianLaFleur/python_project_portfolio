Profile
Appearance
Paimon has a petite body, giving her the look of a fairy. She has thick white hair cropped just above her shoulders, dark purple eyes, and light skin. In some official art, the tip of one of her front hair locks fades to black.
She wears a long-sleeved white jumper and a night-blue cape flecked with stars, and white stockings with white boots. Rose-gold embroidery and shapes are attached to her jumper, boots, and sleeves.
Paimon's accessories are a dark blue hairpin, almost black, and a rose-gold tiara that levitates above her head as though it was a halo.

They all have different strengths — some might have an incredible range of focal lengths, others might have a really wide field of view. Oh, and there's also more novelty ones that can apply special effects to the image. Take this one, for example — when you take a portrait photo with this, it turns their face all chubby...

You seem to misunderstand me. Let me be quite clear: Most of the time, I simply enjoy watching people's facial contortions when they're put in an awkward position. Watching them squirm, you might say. Is that so strange?

I heard all about you when I first arrived back in Mondstadt. Super powerful people like you and Paimon usually have some kind of strict personal code.

The winds blow through Mondstadt all year, so this supply of water is very stable.Paimon: Also, windmills are what they call "visible winds" — and wind chimes are the "audible winds".Paimon: Paimon guesses they can be thought of as mascots and prayers to the Anemo Archon for protection.(Traveler): Ah, mascots. So, like you then Paimon?Paimon: No! Not at all! They're made of wood, and you can't eat them in an emergency either, cause all you'd do is grind your teeth down!(Traveler): (‍Uhh...Uhh...Text for Aether/Umm...Umm...Text for Lumine‍)(Traveler): ...I don't know what to say to that.About Teyvat Media:VO_Aether_About Teyvat.ogg Media:VO ZH_Aether_About Teyvat.ogg Media:VO JA_Aether_About Teyvat.ogg Media:VO KO_Aether_About Teyvat.ogg Media:VO_Lumine_About Teyvat.ogg Media:VO ZH_Lumine_About Teyvat.ogg Media:VO JA_Lumine_About Teyvat.ogg Media:VO KO_Lumine_About Teyvat.ogg (Traveler): Teyvat's day and night both seem particularly short.(Traveler): The skies here are full of stars, but they aren't the same as the ones seen from my home.(Traveler): I wonder if the fates of people from Teyvat are also related to their constellations.Paimon: Oh? Do you know how to read the stars, too? That's amazing! Not a lot of people outside Sumeru can do it.Paimon: Paimon's curious! Come on, do a reading for me, quick!(Traveler): Hmm...(Traveler): The night sky pictured on Paimon's cape... flows with the light of many stars, and also of the deep ocean...(Traveler): The movement of these stars... tells me that... in, say, seven days from now...Paimon: In seven days what?(Traveler): Something good, or something bad, might occur...Paimon: Heh, right... your theory sounds as rock solid as a Geo Slime...

Then, when they suddenly declined in number, the price shot up in response, but the value shown by this steelyard wasn't updated.

Trivia
"Paimon" holds the rank of King, one of the 9 Kings of Hell as mentioned in the Ars Goetia, the first part of The Lesser Key of Solomon, a Grimoire based on demonology and evocation of archaic deities.
A recurring gag in the game is calling Paimon "Emergency Food."
The first instance of this can be found in the Archon Quest Wind-Riding Knight in Prologue: Act I - The Outlander Who Caught the Wind, where the Traveler, during their first meeting with Amber, has the option of introducing Paimon as "Emergency Food."
While having a conversation with Little Xing, Little Xing questions if Paimon is "some kind of food?"
During Friendship in Writing in Yae Miko's Story Quest, Divina Vulpes Chapter: Act I - The Great Narukami Offering, the Traveler is tasked with forming ideas for a short novel based on their travels. For the novel's first chapter, one of the options is "Reincarnated in Another World: Encounters with Airborne Emergency Rations."
Verr Goldet, the boss of Wangshu Inn, describes Paimon as a "floating elf companion." Notably, she is one of the few characters who remarks on Paimon's appearance — others tend to refer to her as a "mysterious flying pet" or some other similar term.
The term Verr Goldet uses in Chinese is 精灵 jīng​líng, which broadly refers to fantastical creatures like elves, fairies, and spirits. This term has also been used to describe Barbatos' original form before becoming an Archon, Klee and Alice's race, and the Oceanids.
Starsnatcher describes Paimon as "talking fairy," or "talking mini Seelie" (会说话的小仙灵) in Chinese, though Paimon is confused by this remark about her.
Paimon's exchange with Venti in the Archon Quest State of the Holy Lyre der Himmel in Prologue: Act II - For a Tomorrow Without Tears, where she responds to Venti's "Hehe." with "What do you mean 'hehe'?", has been alluded to twice in the story thus far. Once was during the World Quest Date's Challenge with Date responding to Paimon with "What do you mean 'hehe'?!", and another was the Traveler's response to Paimon during the Event World Quest Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: Two Cities' Recommendations in Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas.
During the Closed Beta Tests, Paimon was used as a spokesperson, replying to the questions and suggestions on the official Facebook page.
In the image used to announce the end of CBT1, Paimon is featured with an unknown staff alongside her.
Paimon's role as the mascot of Genshin Impact is similar to Ai-Chan, the mascot for Honkai Impact 3rd, another of HoYoverse's games.
Paimon represents some parts of the gameplay system in Genshin Impact.
HoYoverse's official announcement and developer messages are sent by "P·A·I·M·O·N" in the mail system. This is different from Paimon's own mail, which is signed simply as "Paimon."
The pause menu is called the "Paimon Menu," and is indicated in-game by an icon resembling Paimon's head.
Despite her omnipresence in marketing and player communication, Paimon is something of an enigma with regards to the plot and Teyvat as nothing about her prior to being fished out of the water is known, or even about her basic nature.
Paimon appears to be resistant to certain phenomena which would otherwise require a Vision or elemental affinity, such as the contaminated region of Avidya Forest in Tighnari's Story Quest Vulpes Zerda Chapter: Act I - The Unanswerable Problems.
Paimon shares the same Chinese and Japanese Voice Actress with Rozaliya Olenyeva from Honkai Impact 3rd.
This was joked about during the Honkai Impact 3rd × Genshin Impact crossover in the event Outworld Quest: Proposal 1, where Rozaliya, standing in for the Traveler, asks Paimon why she sounds just like her, to which Paimon responds "Ahem! Why would you say weird things like that? You just woke up! And how do you know? There's no dubbing!"
Despite the Traveler fishing Paimon out of the water at the beginning of the game, fishing was not released until Version 2.1.
It is hinted that Paimon cannot swim.
During Bird's Eye View, when the Traveler swims to the island in Starfell Lake, she floats above them just over the water.
Paimon claims to be "the god of protection," her reasoning being that she considers herself the Traveler's bodyguard.[5]
It is jokingly suggested that Paimon has more than one stomach, where one of them specifically contains liquids.[6]
From Version 3.1 onwards, when players open the Paimon Menu, they can blow on their PS5 controller's microphone to change Paimon's idle animation. When done enough times, this elicits a comment from Paimon wondering where the "wind" came from, and repeating this in Version 3.2 will eventually have Paimon call out the player.
The symbol on Paimon's clothing is an upside-down triquetra, one of the prominent symbols in Teyvat. She also bears the celestial motif on her sleeves and boots.
Paimon's headpiece shares design elements with a fully-upgraded Statue of The Seven. The ring that forms around the statue at Level 10 has the same design as the ring that forms the base of her headpiece, while the vertical protrusion on her headpiece is a simplified version of the diamond-shaped leaf motif that appears upon upgrading the statue to Level 6.
Paimon shares her birthday with Arataki Itto on June 1, International Day for Protection of Children, a widely celebrated holiday for children in countries such as Armenia, Burma, Cambodia, China, Ethiopia, Mongolia, Russia, and Portugal. In some countries, it is a national holiday and fairs will be hosted for children; the two sharing their birthdays on this date may relate to their childlike nature and soft spot for children.
While mostly absent from Hangout Events, she does make an appearance in:
Barbara's Hangout Event: Act I - Wellspring of Healing
Noelle's Hangout Event: Act I - Chivalric Training
Bennett's Hangout Event: Act I - Fantastic Voyage
Shikanoin Heizou's Hangout Event: Act I - Trap 'Em by Storm
