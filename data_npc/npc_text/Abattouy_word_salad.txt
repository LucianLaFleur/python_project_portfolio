Profile[]
Abattouy enrolled in Sumeru Akademiya in order to study mechanical lifeforms, seeing them as machines with potential. However, the Akademiya prohibited the study of machines due to people going beyond acceptable norms in their experiments. He was unfazed and continued researching machinery, after being expelled from the Akademiya.
Regardless, Abattouy was determined to continue on with his research, although he lost contact with everyone he had met in the Akademiya, including Tighnari. He created a machine known as "Karkata," which looked much like a Ruin Defender. Abattouy was determined to bring Karkata to life, as the machine had the mindset of a child and could only understand simple responses. Roughly two years before the start of the game's events, he found a secluded area and began construction of a laboratory to continue his research and experiments.
Abattouy eventually made modifications to Karkata, giving it basic survival instincts so it could maintain itself when it was damaged or low on energy.
In order to make the most of his limited Mora, Abattouy began taking power from the Ley Lines by creating three generators and selling the failures to an Eremite named Kasim for some Mora.[2] He also cut medication for his heart from his expenses, and he likely ate much less than usual. As a result, a malnourished Abattouy died when his heart acted up as his body became overwhelmed by the energy from Ley Line energy extractor and Karkata failed to understand Abattouy's request to shut it off. After Abattouy's death, Karkata, not understanding the concept of death, tried to collect parts to "repair" Abattouy to no avail.
Abattouy's body and laboratory would eventually be found by the Traveler and Tighnari, who had been investigating rumors of a supposedly contaminated zone different to that of The Withering, which had attracted droves of Ruin Machines to the area. Learning what happened to him through tape recordings, they shut the devices down before Tighnari buried him and destroyed his laboratory and most of his research to prevent the Akademiya from getting their hands on them.

Trivia[]
In the Akademiya's Restricted Repository, there is a "Mechanical Life Forms Research Data" file that is most likely about Abattouy. It is an optional interactable that can be found during All Returns to Silence in Cyno's Story Quest, Lupus Aureus Chapter: Act I - Sands of Solitude.
