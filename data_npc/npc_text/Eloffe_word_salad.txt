Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

Eloffe: Welcome to Chioriya Boutique. Is there anything you need?
 Tell me about Chioriya Boutique...
Eloffe: This clothes shop was opened by Ms. Chiori, a renowned Inazuman designer.
Eloffe: She has gained great favor in Fontaine's fashion world by incorporating elements of "resistance" and "revolution" into her designs.
Eloffe: I know this sounds like tooting one's own horn, but it is no exaggeration to say that Ms. Chiori has sparked a real fashion craze here in our nation.
 And you are...
Eloffe: I'm Eloffe, a staff member here at the boutique. I'm in charge of taking pre-orders and receiving clients... and placating them, at times.
 Placating clients?
Eloffe: Our boss's manner of speech is... on the straightforward side. Takes some getting used to, if you catch my drift.
Eloffe: But not to worry. Chioriya Boutique's work is always up to standard.
Eloffe: This is why some customers might leave in a huff, but they'll be back in a few days to commission clothes all the same.
 I don't really need anything at the moment.
Eloffe: I look forward to your next visit.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after completing When They Talk About Tonight.


Eloffe: Ah, it's you. Welcome. What can I do for you today?
 Tell me about Chioriya Boutique.
Eloffe: This clothes shop was opened by Ms. Chiori, a renowned Inazuman designer.
Eloffe: She has gained great favor in Fontaine's fashion world by incorporating elements of "resistance" and "revolution" into her designs.
Eloffe: I know this sounds like tooting one's own horn, but it is no exaggeration to say that Ms. Chiori has sparked a real fashion craze here in our nation.
 How's business been lately?
Eloffe: Thanks to you, Ms. Chiori's fashion show was a smash hit.
Eloffe: Since then, we've launched a large number of new products, and customers have been pouring in like a waterfall. If anything, we haven't got enough manpower to handle it all.
Eloffe: Ms. Chiori has even mentioned that she'd like to go on a trip with you sometime.
Eloffe: Ah, but be sure not to tell her that I was the one who told you.
 I don't really need anything at the moment.
Eloffe: I look forward to your next visit.

Character Voice-OversCharacterVoice-OversChioriAbout Emilie Media:VO_Chiori About Emilie.ogg Media:VO ZH_Chiori About Emilie.ogg Media:VO JA_Chiori About Emilie.ogg Media:VO KO_Chiori About Emilie.ogg Emilie's perfumes are very popular. We have a business agreement where I ask her to deliver small quantities of perfume she's working on to Chioriya Boutique. I let Eloffe secretly spray the perfume in the fitting room, and then I'll let her know any feedback I get from the customers. Even after all this time, I've never once had a customer ever say that my fitting room smelled strange. In fact, they usually come one after another to ask where they can buy the fragrance. Out of curiosity, I always buy a bottle when she brings them to sell in her shop. I have to say that such fragrances which can always bring a sense of refreshment are truly works of art.
Trivia[]
In Chiori's character teaser Eloffe is shown to also be a tailor, directed by Chiori to make alterations on a wedding dress order.
Etymology[]
Eloffe is likely named after the French fashion merchant Adélaïde Henriette Damoville, also known as Madame Eloffe.
