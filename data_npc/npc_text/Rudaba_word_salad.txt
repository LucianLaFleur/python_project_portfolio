Dialogue[]

Rudaba: Hello, are you... a Vanara?
Rudaba: Can I ask you a few questions?
 Adventure Challenge
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Rudaba: Even though the Amurta are not good with numbers, I often play this game privately, so I'm quite well-practiced...
(If the player wins the match)

Rudaba: ...I'm done playing. It's time to move on with the interviews and the research.
 Who are you...
Rudaba: Oh my, I forgot to introduce myself.
Rudaba: I'm an Amurta researcher from the Akademiya, and I'm carrying out an academic study on the rainforest.
Rudaba: I'm ashamed to admit it, but I haven't been able to hire a suitable bodyguard due to financial difficulties. So I've been temporarily limited to small-scale surveys in areas protected by the Forest Rangers.
 I'm not a Vanara...
Rudaba: Oh... What a shame.
Rudaba: Still, the opinion of others... can be used as a reference as well, right?
Rudaba: That said, I wonder how much you know about Avidya Forest...
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

Rudaba: The traces Greater Lord Rukkhadevata left in the rainforest, how many of them have you seen?
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

Rudaba: ...Or how much of the traces the Dendro Archon left behind you've encountered?
Rudaba: ...Oh, forgive me for taking so much of your time. If you don't mind, you can have a chat with me when you're free.
 Sorry that I couldn't help you...
Rudaba: Oh, it's okay. Thanks anyway.
