Dialogue[]

Feroz: Huh, little beetle, where do you come from?
 Little beetle...
Feroz: Yeah, a little beetle. Even smaller than the tiniest golden scarab.
Feroz: Look at you, as thin as a stick. If you dare travel to the desert, you'll surely get crushed by the huge trunks and rocks left by King Deshret.
Feroz: Take my advice, hire a capable bodyguard, or stay where people are, away from the desert!
 Rotten Ajilenakh Nuts...
Feroz: You heard that? Don't worry about it. I wasn't talking about you.
Feroz: I was talking about the hateful smugglers and those rattling about "resurrecting King Deshret." Dimwits!
Feroz: Like Ajilenakh Nuts rotting in the sand, they are sticky and annoying.
Feroz: It would be a relief to all of us if the stupid Akademiya were to take them down!
Feroz: Bringing this up with the Navbed is no use, they just beat around the bush.
Feroz: It seems that wine is the only thing they wouldn't skirt around!
 "Resurrecting King Deshret"?
(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

Feroz: Foolish idea!
Feroz: Toying with life and death is a futile endeavor!
Feroz: If the King Deshret could rise from the sands, so could Greater Lord Rukkhadevata sprout from the soil!
Feroz: The King Deshret is long gone. Those wannabes don't deserve the title of the Eremites if they can't even face it!
Feroz: Death is the fairest thing in the world. A god high above or a bug deep in dirt, it comes for everyone all the same.
(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

Feroz: Pfft. A foolish notion!
Feroz: Toying with life and death is a futile endeavor!
Feroz: If King Deshret would so easily rise up from a pile of sand and dust, could little sprouts that have just broken the soil not immediately grow into monumental trees?
Feroz: King Deshret is long gone. Those wannabes claim the name of the Eremites in vain if they can't even face up to that fact!
Feroz: Death is the fairest thing in the world. Whether a god high above or a bug down in dirt, it comes for everyone all the same.
 And you are...
Feroz: I'm a mercenary from Aaru Village. If you're asking about the local nonsense, go annoy someone else.
Feroz: It's a heck of a place, but at least life is better here than in Aaru Village.
Feroz: Otherwise who would have come all the way here to work for the darn Akademiya? I'm not stupid!
 Goodbye...
Feroz: Let's go.
