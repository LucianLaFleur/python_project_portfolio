Dialogue[]

Faustier: Is it so hard to believe?
 Who are you?
Faustier: What? It's me, Faustier!
Faustier: Eh? Oh, sorry, I must've gotten the wrong person. Too many people ask me that, so I thought you must be an old acquaintance.
 Old friends don't recognize you?
Faustier: Well, I had a short stint in the Fortress of Meropide. Petty theft and such...
Faustier: And when I came out, no one could recognize me any longer - they said I'd changed too much.
Faustier: Well, I certainly was a leaner sight in the past - it took quite some effort just to move chairs, even. But unrecognizable, really? I just bulked up a little, that's all.
 It's understandable.
Faustier: Really? Did I change so much?
Faustier: Well, I've got the Pankration Ring to thank for that, then.
Faustier: When I first watched a boxing match, I couldn't help but wonder if I would ever stolen, had I simply been strong enough.
Faustier: After serving my sentence, I was invited to join the Spina, and I began to do some legitimate manual labor... I guess I'm finally on the right path, no?
 See you.
Faustier: See you.
