"Why did you save me? Can't you see that I'm an oni?" "You must be hungry. Come, I've made some porridge.""I told you, I'm an oni! Can't you see them horns?" "Oh, I can see them. Do you want some of that porridge, by the way?""Agh, you know what, you're not listening to me at all. Oh, alright... One bowl of porridge, please." "Coming right up."
Despite her name, Granny Oni is not actually an oni; this was a nickname given to her as a result of her taking in Arataki Itto in his youth, as people continued to discriminate against oni. After Itto's parents died, he was left on the streets and tore into people who spoke ill of the oni; this resulted in him being beaten by a group of ruffians who had banded together at one point, but Granny Oni saved him.[1] She has since taken care of him as if he was her own son.
During Itto's Story Quest, Granny Oni helped take care of Daisuke after his parents had been kidnapped by ronin. When the Traveler returned with news of Itto's arrest and the revelation of a blue oni tribe, Granny Oni immediately began making preparations to help the secluded oni, who had been living in neglect.

Appearance[]
Granny Oni is a bespectacled elderly lady with her gray hair parted in the middle. She wears a brown striped apron dress over a gray nagagi.

In fact, she's the kindest human that has ever lived. She only got her nickname because she took me in. If people have got a problem with me, fine, I don't care what other people think anyway... *sigh* But I wish people wouldn't go after her because of me.
