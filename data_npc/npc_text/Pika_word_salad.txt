Dialogue[]


Yamaue: When the show starts, you will say, "Tokunaga, hurry, show us a good one!" before I'll show up with a backflip...
Tokunaga: Wait, isn't that a bit over the top? I think it'll be better if we stick to the original plan. You just scare me from behind, and I'll pretend to be shocked...
Yamaue: No no, that's too simple. Our goal is to become professional comedians! How can we make a name for ourselves if we don't give it all we've got?
Yamaue: Even a dog wouldn't laugh at tricks as old as pretending to be scared. Don't you think so, Pika?
Pika: ?
Yamaue: See?
Tokunaga: See what, exactly? If you come over and scare me, I can make it really funny. I'll show you if you don't believe me!
Tokunaga: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
Yamaue: ...
Tokunaga: Pretty funny, right?
Tokunaga: Well... Pika, you tell him if that's funny.
Pika: (Wiggling tail)
