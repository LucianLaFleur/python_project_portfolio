Dialogue[]

Geri: Hello. As a native of Mondstadt, I must say that Liyue Harbor is quite a nice place, but as for the food...
 Who are you?
Geri: My name is Geri. My sister Freki and I are "bon vivant" travelers in search of  fine cuisine. Our aim is to taste and see all that the seven nations have to offer.
Geri: But we never expected to meet such an unprecedented challenge on our very first stop of the trip...
Geri: The people of Liyue are so unpleasant.
 About food and drink...
Geri: I absolutely cannot stand Zhongyuan Chop Suey, it's practically inedible!
Geri: Back in Mondstadt, my favorite food is Moon Pie.
Geri: It's a pie made with seasonal fruits, pieces of cheese, and chicken. When enjoyed together with a special fruit cocktail, it is most superb.
Geri: I hardly suspected that the neighboring Liyue cuisine would differ so greatly from our own. Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined people that would make food from animal innards.
Geri: I still need some time to mentally prepare myself, whew...
 So what are you gonna eat while you're in Liyue?
Geri: Well, luckily my sister and I both know enough about cooking that we won't go hungry...
Geri: ...No, we can't let it come to that! We came on this trip to eat food from all around the world, and that's exactly what we're gonna do!
Geri: Yes, I must force myself to get used to the food here... Okay, full disclosure, we caved and cooked some pancakes this morning. Here, take them off me.
Geri: Come on, Geri, you can do this... One whole portion of chop suey, delicious chop suey...
(Obtain  Tea Break Pancake ×3)
 Bon appétit.
Geri: May the God of Anemo bless you.
Geri: Alas, shall the very first stop already hail the end of our journey across the seven nations?

Event Dialogue[]
Moonlight Merriment[]

Geri: The Moonchase Festival is here, and with it, the Masterful Chefs tournament. All the Liyue locals are getting fired up about good food again, it seems.
Geri: Should I take this chance to try a few more Liyue dishes? Oh, but the food here is just...

Trivia[]
Geri and his sister Freki are both named after the two wolves that accompany Odin in Norse Mythology.
