Dialogue[]

Shadi: Everyone's right. If you do business with the lord, you are sure to make money!
 The lord?
Shadi: Haven't you heard? He's famous among us merchants! Lord Sangemah Bay!
Shadi: Many people haven't met the lord himself, but as long as the lord reveals business information, you can just trust it. Following it leads to sure profit!
Shadi: Look at this batch of rugs I've got. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to sell them because of the quality and high cost.
Shadi: But the lord said not to worry and that I'd make a good deal, so I was bold and asked for the price I wanted.
Shadi: And the result was solid. I made a good profit even after paying a high trade fee!
 See you.
Shadi: See you! Trust the lord and you'll turn a big profit!
