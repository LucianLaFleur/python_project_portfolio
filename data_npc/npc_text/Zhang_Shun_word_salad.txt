Dialogue[]

Zhang Shun: What do you think of my wares, friend? Rare things to see on dry land.
 Got anything good in?
Zhang Shun: Every last item is a keepsake from a voyage across the oceans. Genuine goods at honest prices!
 Just what are these things from exactly?
Zhang Shun: What? You think they're stolen?
Zhang Shun: Of course not, I'm a sailor with The Crux. They're the spoils of years of service.
Zhang Shun: But I got injured during the battle against Haishan. If it weren't for Captain Beidou, I'd be a goner.
Zhang Shun: So I decided it best I leave The Crux. Can't have a crewmate's old injury flaring up and dragging the crew under...
Zhang Shun: At least the things I collected over the years is enough to keep me going though.
 Tell me about your battle trophies.
Zhang Shun: Of all of them, this cup here is probably the one I'll never forget. Brings back memories of my drinking days.
Zhang Shun: ...But to be honest, now that I've decided to settle down and have a normal life, having it around only makes me sad that those days are over, which doesn't really help me move on.
Zhang Shun: Thanks for listening to me for so long. Actually, why don't I give this to you? Maybe it'll come in handy on one of your adventures.

 About Rex Lapis' death...
(Unlocked after completing Rite of Descension)
Zhang Shun: Aye... In my many years spent sailing the open ocean, Captain Beidou took great delight in telling us many a tale of Rex Lapis' many feats.
Zhang Shun: If Captain Beidou is the star that guides us in the night sky, then Rex Lapis is what keeps the whole sky up in place.
Zhang Shun: I always said that I would see a Rite of Descension if I returned to land. I never thought...
 No need.
Zhang Shun: Nothing takes your interest? Travel well.

Event Dialogue[]
Moonlight Merriment[]

Zhang Shun: Have you heard the news? Captain Beidou of the Crux brought something amazing back from overseas again!
Zhang Shun: They say that it's the statue of an ancient adeptus... Or a god... Well, whatever it is, it's a really awesome statue!
Zhang Shun: Well, it's the Crux Fleet, you know? Anything they're packing is bound to be good. Well then. Would you like something today, friend?

Fleeting Colors in Flight[]

Zhang Shun: I heard that Captain Beidou took up some salvaging work recently. I wonder what treasures she'll dredge up this time...
Zhang Shun: But since it's work from the Qixing, I doubt any of those treasures will ever find their way to me anyway.
Zhang Shun: Still, I've got quite a few rare items that you can hardly find on land. Care to have a look?
