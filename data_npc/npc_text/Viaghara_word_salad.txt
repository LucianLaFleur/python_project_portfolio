Profile[]
Little is known about Viaghara beyond the stories regarding its creation. According to legends, after Greater Lord Rukkhadevata chose to split from King Deshret and the Great Red Sand, she moved eastwards and created the Varuna Contraption to nurture a rainforest, later called Dharma Forest. The Varuna Contraption's creation caused the moon's reflection on the water to create the image of a labyrinth. This labyrinth gave birth to a divine beast[4] in the form of a tiger, which was named Viaghara.[3][5]

Appearance[]
Viaghara's stripes resembled "blazing flames"[1] and were constantly changing.[3]

Story[]
When Viaghara was born, Rukkhadevata gave him a certain crown, and the two exchanged tokens to represent their friendship, described as "gems that glimmered like water and silver that gleamed like the moonlight."[1] After the Aranara — or the "children of the pomegranate" — were created, Viaghara blessed them under the first Vasara Tree and made a pact with Rukkhadevata to share the labyrinth with them.[3] From then on, the two groups worked together to protect the Varuna Contraption and the "secret of sun and rain": the lords of the forest used hedges and streams, while the Aranara used dreams and illusions.[5]
The crown Rukkhadevata had given him was passed down to a girl named Cinnamon, Viaghara's squire,[6] who was the first maiden to follow in the lords of the forests' footsteps.[7] Cinnamon went on to teach other children of the forest how to navigate the labyrinth and follow the rules of nature, who themselves went on to teach more successors and established what would be known as the guardians of the forest. Viridescent, who lived during the cataclysm 500 years ago, came from that lineage, but abandoned that path in order to enact revenge on Abyssal monsters.[6][8]
Nothing else can be determined about Viaghara's life beyond its death at an unknown point in the past, with each successor after it changing their palace's form based on their images and visions.[9] It had an unknown number of successors, which ultimately ended with a tiger only referred to as the "final lord of the forest," which died defending the forest during the cataclysm.[3][9] From then on, the Rishboland Tigers have succeeded the "tiger" name.

Faramarz and the Huntress[]
An unknown amount of time after King Deshret sacrificed himself to end the forbidden knowledge pollution he had brought to his kingdom, which led it to ruin, a fallen desert prince named Faramarz eventually attempted to try his luck in the forest. However, sensing that Faramarz had blood on his hands and wishing to prevent him from trying to conquer the forest, the lord of the forest at the time ordered a huntress wielding a white bow — now known as Hunter's Path — to drive him away over and over again.[10][11] However, the huntress refused to take his life in hopes that he could one day redeem himself. Though the king did not see that potential in Faramarz, he ordered the huntress to guide the desert-dweller into the maze to pick off a white branch. Faramarz's ultimate fate is unclear,[12] with accounts suggesting he died in the forest.[10][11]
It is unknown whether the lord of the forest and the huntress involved in this story were Viaghara and Cinnamon; due to a lack of names for the other lords of the forest, it is currently assumed that the "ancient forest king" refers to Viaghara.
