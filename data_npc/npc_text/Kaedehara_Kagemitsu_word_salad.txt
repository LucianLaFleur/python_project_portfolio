Kagemitsu was an apprentice of the Isshin Art alongside Niwa Nagamitsu and Akame Mitsunaga when Futsu Masayoshi, the bladesmith of Haran Geppaku Futsu, approached them. Having left the Futsu School to avoid a succession crisis between himself and the fourth-generation master Futsu Hiroyoshi, Masayoshi left to travel around and learn the techniques of other forging practices. The three apprenticed under Masayoshi and went on to create each piece in the Isshin Sansaku.[1]

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
The names Kagemitsu (Japanese: 景光), Nagamitsu (Japanese: 長光), and Sanenaga (Japanese: 実長) (rendered in the English localization as Mitsunaga) are derived from the three disciples of Mitsutada (Japanese: 光忠), the founder of the Osafune School which thrived during the Kamakura period. The three disciples were known as the "Three Great Masters" (Japanese: 三作 sansaku) of the Osafune School.[2]
The real-life Kagemitsu was Nagamitsu's son and Mitsutada's grandson, and became the third-generation master of the Osafune School. Among his known works is the Koryu Kagemitsu.[3]
