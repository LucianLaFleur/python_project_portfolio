Fynn wears one of the standard uniforms of the Knights of Favonius. The uniform consists of a black long-sleeve shirt and horse riding pants with white plate armor worn on top. However, the poleyns, greaves, and sabatons are black. The Knights of Favonius crest decorates the breastplate. He also wears a leather belt like many other knights, but he doesn't carry a sword.
