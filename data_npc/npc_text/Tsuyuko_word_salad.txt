Dialogue[]
Her normal dialogue is available after The Moon-Bathed Deep.


Tsuyuko: Oh, it's you! It's been a while!
 About Byakuyakoku...
(After The Still Water's Flow)
Tsuyuko: Enkanomiya's name was Byakuyakoku once upon a time. There was neither sun nor moon in that underground realm, and the only two astronomical phenomena being the Whitenight and the Evernight.
Tsuyuko: One of my ancestors was a shrine maiden named Eboshi. She was a character of some significance in Byakuyakoku's history, and it is due to her that I am in charge of the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri.
 How have things been?
Tsuyuko: How have what things been... Oh, you mean my work here?
Tsuyuko: Well, we've been dealing with various issues for people whose livelihoods have been affected by the war... I doubt you'd be enthused to hear about such dry stuff.
Tsuyuko: Nonetheless, I'm doing pretty alright. Thanks for your concern.
 So, about that whole Enkanomiya business...
(Before The Still Water's Flow. This was only available prior to version 2.4 before Enkanomiya was added in game)‍[verification needed]
Tsuyuko: Her Excellency the Divine Priestess has yet to authorize our request to open Enkanomiya. We'll just have to wait for her to make the call.
Tsuyuko: In any case, our primary task right now is the restoration of the peoples' lives... More long term plans will have to wait for a while.
Tsuyuko: Still, I can't say I'm not excited to find out what our ancestral lands deep beneath the ocean waves looks like.
Tsuyuko: In any case, the conclusion of this matter was thanks to your help as well. Allow me to express our gratitude once again.
 See you around.
Tsuyuko: See you. Watatsumi Island will always welcome you.
