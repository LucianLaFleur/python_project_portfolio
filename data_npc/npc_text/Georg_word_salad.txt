Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before starting Sounds From Afar.


Georg: Are you here to set up a booth, too?
Georg: The wine market is being held outside of Springvale this time. Not only is the scenery gorgeous, but delivering goods there is pretty convenient.
Georg: But since we — that is, Angel's Share — have a large booth, it takes quite a long time to get everything set up.

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available during Sounds From Afar, when the Weinlesefest venue is set up.


Georg: Would you like something to drink? Not only are we selling wine, but we are also acquiring all kinds of wine-making ingredients during the festival. You're welcome to come around and discuss anything you're interested in.
 I'd like to sell wine-making ingredients.
Georg: Sure, these are the ingredients that we're buying at the moment.
(Open menu for Selling Ingredients)
 I'd like to buy some beverages.
Georg: Here's the menu.

 About this booth...
Georg: Angel's Share participates in Weinlesefest each time, and plenty of folk come all the way here to Mondstadt to sample our limited-edition wines.
Georg: Back when Master Crepus was around, he'd come to us in person every year to drink a glass...
Georg: *sigh* I don't know why, but this festival always makes me nostalgic.
Georg: Diluc... I mean, Master Diluc has had a rough go of it these past few years, but he seems to be in good spirits this year.
Georg: As long as Master Diluc is well, I'm sure Master Crepus' spirit up above will also be pleased.
 Bye.
Georg: See you. Come back any time!
