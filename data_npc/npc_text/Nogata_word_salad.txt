Profile[]
Nogata is the leader of a ronin group based in Tatarasuna, robbing those who travel between it and Yashiori Island. At some point, he took in the blue oni Takuya, likely for the additional manpower despite disagreeing with the oni's values and acquired a rare paper charm that would allow him to destroy his hideout if it was ever compromised.
Nogata and his crew would rob and kidnap various Inazumans and keep them hostage in their hideout, with Takuya participating in them. As many Inazumans believed the blue oni had died out, Takuya was mistaken for  Arataki Itto, the only other known oni on the islands. The Tenryou Commission posted a commission to apprehend Itto, which was taken by the Traveler, although after learning of Itto's intentions, began to help him. The Traveler and Itto managed to find Nogata's hideout and free all of the hostages before confronting him and Takuya. Nogata threatened to blow the hideout up by tearing the paper charm and attempted to do so, but the charm had been taken by Takuya, who stated that he had violated the agreement they had made before being sucker punched by Itto.
When the Tenryou Commission arrived, Nogata recovered and lunged at Takuya, resulting in a struggle that tore the charm apart. Before Nogata could escape, he was crushed by a falling rock.
