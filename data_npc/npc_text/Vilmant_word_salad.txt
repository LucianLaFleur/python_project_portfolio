Profile[]
Vilmant is a member of Aurelie's troupe. Because the troupe was financially struggling, one time he accepted a sponsorship from a businessman who wanted to handle his drinks to audience, not knowing that the drinks were Sinthe. When Aurelie declined the sponsorship, she became a target of the serial disappearances case, which caused Vilmant to blame himself for her death, while not telling his coworkers about that. In "The Little Oceanid" he plays Ciamaca, the chief of the village, who blames everything on the Oceanid.
