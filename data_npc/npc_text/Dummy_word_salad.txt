Dialogue[]

Dummy: Oh my, a guest! How rare.
 Rare?
Dummy: We don't get many of you around these parts — these parts being what they are, of course.
Dummy: I mean, aren't you concerned that we might be some sort of illegal establishment?
Dummy: Haha, I kid, I kid. Please don't tell the boss that I'm scaring customers away again.
 So, what's your story?
Dummy: Me? Well, I had a bit of a bad name in the past. Roamed the streets, got into fights.
Dummy: Had my eye on Mr. Zhu here. Could see in a blink that he was some rich guy, so I came here. You know, earn some cash, pass the time.
Dummy: But the days have been way more leisurely than I thought they'd be. Before I knew it, I didn't have that fire in me anymore.
Dummy: Now I just want to find a girl to marry... Maybe it's the age or maybe it's this peaceful life, but I've changed...
 Farewell, then.
Dummy: You too. Go well.

Trivia[]
Dummy is likely a reference to the Chinese voice acting director for Genshin Bo Peng (彭博), who also voices Zhongli in Chinese. One of his nicknames is 阿笨, which is Dummy's Chinese name.
