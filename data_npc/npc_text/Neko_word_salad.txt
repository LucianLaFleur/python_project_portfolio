Profile[]
Neko is a cat that has lived for at least 500 years, during the cataclysm and the time of Asase Hibiki and Ako Domeki, and was named by Hibiki for her habit of sleeping. She and the other cats presumably lived at Asase Shrine and enjoyed spending time with Hibiki as she created delicious meals for all to share. Unbeknownst to Neko, Hibiki drastically changed after the events of the cataclysm, and while she managed to live a relatively normal life after returning from the Grand Narukami Shrine, she had been deeply affected by the deaths of Takamine the Mistsplitter and the Kitsune Saiguu. She later helped Domeki fight off a Shogunate fleet despite the pirate's insistence that she stay out of his affairs, breaking the wards and unleashing a Thunder Manifestation, causing a huge thunderstorm that resulted in Hibiki and Domeki disappearing.
The island would remain in mostly perpetual thunderstorms and Neko waited at the shrine, hoping for Hibiki's return and took the position of Provisional Head Priestess at the shrine to keep the place intact, but she and the remaining cats were unable to maintain the shrine and it fell into disrepair. Domeki and his fleet eventually returned to the island, but it had fallen into ruins due to the Thunder Manifestation and they left to set sail for other lands. Neko appeared to be unaware of his return.
500 years later, Seirai Island would be visited by Etsuko, Taisuke, and the Traveler. The former two were part of the Adventurers' Guild, commissioned to investigate the island and discovered the broken wards, while the Traveler had just set foot and was encountered the two. The Traveler offered to help them and used Elemental Sight to discover cat tracks leading to the shrine, where they met Neko. Neko told them that the shrine had fallen into disrepair and had them repair the shrine's offering box so people could deposit Mora, unaware that the village had been abandoned for hundreds of years. Once they did so, she told them how to repair the wards, which ended the thunderstorms and made the cats comfortable.
After the thunderstorms around the island were dealt with, Neko would task the Traveler with putting the shrine back in order and helping out the cats in her care. After "hiring" Ooshima Junpei to create a statue of her, upon performing the finishing touch, a cloud overhead shaped itself into a cat, which Neko interpreted as a good sign from Hibiki and the others. Neko promised to introduce the four to Hibiki and her friends when they returned and began making preparations for their eventual arrival. After taking a stroll around the island, she discovered that the village was devoid of life and wondered where their inhabitants had gone, unaware of the events that had taken place back then.
Neko eventually heard of the Grand Narukami Shrine and requested the Traveler bring her there. She was amazed by the shrine's large offering box, although still stating that her shrine was better. After inquiring about Hibiki, she decided to return to her shrine and continue waiting for Hibiki's return.

Dialogue[]

(Before completing Neko Is a Cat: A "Good Turn" Comes Late)
Neko: Hmm... The scent of a human, and a familiar one, too...
Neko: Huh, so it wasn't Hibiki after all.
 A talking cat?
Neko: Hmph. Such a fuss you make, human.
Neko: Of course cats can speak. It is simply that human ears cannot comprehend them.
 Who's Hibiki?
Neko: Hibiki is Hibiki. She came from this shrine.
Neko: A long, long... long, long time ago, after a huge thunderstorm, Hibiki never returned... and there was no one to help brush my fur thereafter.
Neko: Until Hibiki returns, I will care for the shrine, and will brush my own fur, meow meow.
 The Warding Stones have been sealed.
(After completing Seirai Stormchasers: Part IV)‍[verification needed]
Neko: Have they indeed? Most swift of you.
Neko: This way, my hair shall never again stand on end or be warped into furballs.
Neko: Excellent, excellent. Meow, meow.
 See you, then...
Neko: Meow meow... It has been long since I spoke human language. It is such a tiring endeavor...
(After completing Neko Is a Cat: A "Good Turn" Comes Late)
Neko: The shrine looks better and better, and my fur has also grown supple, meow meow.
 So, about the shrine...
Neko: Thanks to your help, the shrine is regaining its former self. Hibiki will surely be pleased when she returns.
Neko: Still, I have discovered something strange...
Neko: On a stroll, I discovered that the surrounding villages have not a soul within them...
Neko: Meow meow... How strange, where did all those humans go?
 How have the people at the shrine been doing?
Neko: I can see that they are all good folk. They have put much Mora in the Offering Box.
Neko: The green human is always frowning, always muttering, always worried about... disappointing some guild or another...
Neko: The green, taller human is... Ohh, he is most terrifying. He knows too much about the weaknesses of cats, meow meow...
Neko: That knock-knocking human seems very concerned about his... salary, but he is a noble, loyal soul. He has even made wooden cats.
Neko: They are all good people. Hibiki will surely become friends with them when she returns. Meow, meow...
 See you.
Neko: Goodbye, meow meow.

Trivia[]
Neko may be the "old cat" mentioned in Hamayumi, whose description is told from Hibiki's perspective.
Neko is mentioned in the descriptions of the following 2 Furnishings: "Seal of the Provisional Head Priestess" Shrine Statue: "Seirai Ward"
Etymology[]
Neko (Japanese: 寝子 Neko, "Sleeping Child") is a pun on the Japanese word for "cat," which is 猫 neko.
In real life, it has been speculated that 寝子 is a possible etymological root for 猫.
Her quest line "Neko Is a Cat" (Japanese: 寝子は猫である Neko wa Neko de Aru) is most likely a reference to the Japanese novel I Am a Cat (Japanese: 吾輩は猫である Wagahai wa Neko de Aru) written by Natsume Souseki in 1905–1906. The novel starts with the famous line "I am a cat. As yet I have no name." while the neko ("cat") in the game claims that she already has her name Neko ("Sleeping Child").
Notes[]

↑ As seen in Neko Is a Cat: The Children, when "Konbumaru" and "Hachihou" are placed beside her.
