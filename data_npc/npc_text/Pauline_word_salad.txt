Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before finishing Favonian Goodies and Buddies


Pauline: We sell all sorts of fresh flowers and plants here — looking to buy a few bouquets?
 And you are?
Pauline: Greetings, Honorary Knight!
Pauline: Perhaps you don't recognize me...
Pauline: But I'm a resident of Springvale, and I run a small flower shop.
Pauline: I'm always busy looking after the flowers and plants, so I haven't had any dealings with visitors from outside the town in a long time...
Pauline: I never thought I'd meet a celebrity like you this year. Perhaps it's good luck brought by the returning wind?
 Flowers and plants?
Pauline: I'm a keen gardener — the plants you see here? I grew them all myself. They're less common varieties that are purely ornamental.
Pauline: My hope is that such beautiful plants will lift everyone's spirits.
Pauline: However, because of their seasonal nature, I can only open for business at certain times of the year.
 Bye.
Pauline: Goodbye, have a nice day!

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available before finishing Charity Event! A Great Success!


Pauline: Hello, do you have any new tasks?
 What about the shop?
Pauline: You'll be pleased to know that business has been doing great recently.
(Open shop management page)
 You've been working hard!
Pauline: Thanks! I feel fulfilled to be able to do something for the elderly and the children!

Dialogue Set #3[]
Available after finishing Charity Event! A Great Success!


Pauline: Honorary Knight, word around town is that the charity sale was a runaway success, all thanks to you, Paimon, Bernhard, and Mats!
Pauline: Even I got a taste of the limelight, getting a few "thank you" notes of my own...
 This is the result of our collaborative efforts.
Pauline: I haven't done enough, not as much as you guys.
Pauline: However, after listening to your business strategy, I felt I have learned a lot and have become a more skilled businesswoman!
Pauline: Anyway, many thanks!
 Let's work together next time!
Pauline: Please make sure to look for me when you get the chance.
