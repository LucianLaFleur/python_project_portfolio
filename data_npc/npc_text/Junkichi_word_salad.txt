Junkichi's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Junkichi is a writer at the Yae Publishing House. He is the author of the Onibudou novel series and his editor is Shigeru. He is frequently at odds with Shigeru thanks to his non-standard writing style, which often involves him adding new abilities or powers to characters with no explanation; Shigeru actively discourages him from doing so but these requests are often ignored, irking him to no end. Junkichi often complains about the creative constraints imposed upon him by Shigeru and attempted to find books to act as "anti-benchmarks" against Shigeru's clear and concise writing style. These "anti-benchmarks" are actually well-liked by Shigeru however, who proceeds to lecture Junkichi on these constraints.
Thanks to Junkichi's unconventional writing style, Onibudou experiences a significant drop in popularity, with Junkichi shrugging this off, claiming this was "the calm before the grand climax". With the Traveler's help, Shigeru requests a survey be conducted on Onibudou's readers; the first response garnered mentions that the novel is interesting but that the writer is "slacking off" due to the abrupt addition of powers to the main character with little to no explanation. Junkichi, confused at the response, attempts to shrug this off as a one-off opinion; he soon finds out that two other readers share similar, if not identical opinions to the first reader, demoralizing him. On returning to Shigeru, the Traveler breaks the news to him, who opines it was probably good for him to realize the consequences of his unconventional writing style.
Now sick and tired of Junkichi's continued antics, Shigeru requests the Traveler act out as Junkichi's ninja character to "give him a feel" of the story. Overwhelmed by the story's complexity thanks to his writing style, Junkichi realizes that his method of writing will only make a story more confusing than it need be and endeavors to take this advice for his next stories.

Idle Quotes[]

 The ability to stop time...
Media:VO Junkichi 01.ogg "Hmm... Surely it would be more interesting for the protagonist to discover their ability to stop time here."

During Hues of the Violet Garden

 How about...
Media:VO Junkichi Irodori 01.ogg "How about... I just do a short story in a parallel universe. Just something to get into the festival."

Dialogue[]

Junkichi: ...And at that moment, klang! Time stops!
Shigeru: Wait, stop...
Junkichi: Exactly! Time stops, and then...
Shigeru: No, I mean "stop." I didn't mean "stopping time"...
Junkichi: Oh, you don't think a time-stop will do? What about invisibility? That sounds good too.
Shigeru: Argh, just listen here, you!
Junkichi: Huh?
Shigeru: Doesn't this character already have a boatload of super powers? If we add another, it will ruin the whole thing!
Junkichi: But...
Shigeru: No buts! Think, man, think!
Junkichi: Okay, okay... Aaand poof, there goes my inspiration all of a sudden.
Junkichi: I mean, come on, my gut tells me that we should give him the ability to stop time right here!
Junkichi: Why don't you think this over, instead?
Shigeru: Ugh, this is so exhausting...

Event Dialogue[]
Hues of the Violet Garden[]

(Talk to Junkichi or Shigeru)
Junkichi: Ugh, this deadline... There's no way I'll make it.
Junkichi: How about I just do a short story in a parallel universe, just to get something in for the festival, and then we can talk?
Shigeru: What? A parallel universe? Will the characters still be the same ones?
Junkichi: Well yes... and not entirely, no...
Junkichi: I mean, if we create a new world setting, then we don't have to consider the original narrative. We'll be free to innovate! This'll be done in no time!
Shigeru: ...Please don't do this. That's no different from the author writing fan fiction for himself!
Shigeru: Adding features and plot devices on for this reason will ruin all the content that we've built up so far. It's not worth it!
Junkichi: Come on, can't we...? Then I guess we've just got to prepare for the eventuality that I won't finish the manuscript.
