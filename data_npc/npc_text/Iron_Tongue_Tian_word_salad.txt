Dialogue[]

Iron Tongue Tian: Tea Master Liu Su was once my senior. He loves to tell elegant, high-flown stories.
Iron Tongue Tian: Me? I don't truck with him and his faux-cultured fellows. What, are the common people unworthy of the storyteller's art, now?

Iron Tongue Tian: Looks like you still got some more counting to do...
(If the player wins the match)

Iron Tongue Tian: Amazing. What a wonderful, eye-opening show.
 Duel

(If the player loses the match)

Iron Tongue Tian: Haha, haha, you gotta quit while you're ahead. That's enough for today!
(If the player wins the match)

Iron Tongue Tian: That was a bad move. Today I really learned something. Hard to believe that you can play like this...
 (Listen in)
Iron Tongue Tian: I don't like the way he rarifies storytelling. This art was originally part of street culture.
Iron Tongue Tian: It's like trying to turn offal from the street kitchens into divine elixir... It's just wrong-headed.
Iron Tongue Tian: Those who aren't familiar with the art might be entertained, but all the old patrons in attendance know that it's got none of storytelling's original flavor.
 (Keep listening)
Iron Tongue Tian: So I'm not sour at all that my senior is famous and earns a lot of money.
Iron Tongue Tian: In front of my old patrons, I daresay this much—
Iron Tongue Tian: Were I to go to the Heyu Tea Whatever today and give an oration...
 (Stop listening)
Iron Tongue Tian: Don't be so skeptical. If I were to go to Heyu Tea House and speak before the ladies and gentlemen of Yujing Terrace...

Event Dialogue[]
The Exquisite Night Chimes[]

(After completing A Thousand Miles for an Enigmatic Tune)
Iron Tongue Tian: Have you heard? This year's Lantern Rite has a new event: a musical performance!
Iron Tongue Tian: If you want to fit in, you should talk about music.
Iron Tongue Tian: But it's hard to attract an audience when you have a romantic atmosphere without a powerful scene...
Iron Tongue Tian: Do you think it's possible to combine singing and fighting?
Iron Tongue Tian: Winning a battle while being accompanied by a dynamic rhythm... Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
Iron Tongue Tian: You wouldn't be able to hear of this story from my fellow, Tea Master Liu Su. All he does is talk about dry, prissy, genteel stuff!
(Dialogue continues as normal)
