 Did you know...?

Dialogue[]

Permingeat: ...Hmm, seems you've already learned all the secrets and found the treasure.
 You... you're really going to clean it all up?
Permingeat: Yep. That's the job the helmsman arranged for me, so I can't refuse.
Permingeat: That's just how things go at The Rusty Rudder, because... we're all under the helmsman's protection.
 Protection? Isn't this place a tavern?
Permingeat: The title of "helmsman" isn't exactly hyperbole. It's more of an... objective adjective.
Permingeat: Mr. Pitot was in charge once... and changed many people's lives.
Permingeat: For those who volunteered to dive into the depths of the ocean, Mr. Pitot was the only helmsman they could rely on.
Permingeat: Until one day, when Mr. Pitot relaxed his grip on the tiller and left the deep sea... He was also one of the few people who could get out of there unscathed.
Permingeat: ...I've told you everything I can. That's it.
Permingeat: Have a nice day at The Rusty Rudder.
