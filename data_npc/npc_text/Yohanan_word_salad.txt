 Grab a drink...

Media:VO Yohanan All Schemes to Know 01.ogg Yohanan: (Hopefully I'll meet a loaded scholar who'll at least pay me enough for a drink.)

Dialogue[]

Yohanan: Can't these Forest Rangers be a little clearer? Spores? Pollen? How do they expect anyone to understand what they're saying?

(If the player loses the match)

Yohanan: Haha, I won! I'm telling you, even some researchers can't win against me!
(If the player wins the match)

Yohanan: What? You only won because you were carried by the strength of your deck...
 Who are you...
Yohanan: I'm from the Eremites.
Yohanan: Uh... What else...
Yohanan: By the way, do you need a bodyguard?
 No, I'm really strong.
Yohanan: Whoa, talk about a braggart.
Yohanan: Well, here's hoping you're strong enough to survive the rainforest.
Yohanan: Otherwise, you'll end up like that researcher over there, who can't afford to hire anyone and just wanders around crowded places.
Yohanan: *sigh* I've heard that many researchers frequent the rainforest to study it, so there are more opportunities to make Mora here. Why can't I find anyone who'll hire me?
Yohanan: I really envy "Flame-Mane." It's said that she's got a huge job in the city. I'll make her buy me some drinks when I get back to the city!
 Seeya.
Yohanan: Huh? Okay.
