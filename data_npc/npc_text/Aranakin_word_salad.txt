Aranakin's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Aranakin is one of the Aranara who is responsible for cleaning Mawtiyima of The Withering that had set root there.
After meeting him, the Traveler found a group of Eremites camping outside and left on reasonable terms. Soon after, Aranakin appeared, telling the Traveler that the Eremites they had spoken to were bad people looking for Aranara. He had been looking Zohrah Mushroom as part of the Arahaoma to restore Mawtiyima; however, the Eremites they had encountered earlier attempted to steal it, but were stopped by the Traveler.
Upon acquiring the Yajna Grass and Barsam Flower, Aranakin and the other caretakers, Aranaga and Aragaru made the Arahaoma and ventured into Mawtiyima and cleansed it of the Withering. Soon after eliminating Marana's Avatar, Aranakin had forgotten them, but after using the melody he had taught them, he was able to convince them that they were good Nara. After exploring an abandoned treehouse, Aranakin caught up with Aranaga and Aragaru to restore some dried flowers.

Dialogue Set #2[]

Aranakin: Kusava~ White Floaty~♪ Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) and White Floaty, sing together!
 About singing...
Aranakin: This song, it is from your story. Aranakin sang this song after obtaining the Zohrah Mushroom.
Aranakin: Aranakin does not remember anymore, but the plants in the forest that hear this song will remember for sure. Aranakin once told them that Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) is an amazing seed, and Aranakin's friend.
 About Khayyam...
Aranakin: Nara Khayyam... I had forgotten his name. He cannot see us anymore, right...?
Aranakin: I can't meet him again, but I will use my singing to tell the forest, and tell the wind, to keep traces of him.
Aranakin: His name will not be forgotten again this way.
 Goodbye.
Aranakin: Bye, friend of Aranakin.

Trivia[]
In English-based language patches, Aranakin's name is a pun and reference to the Star Wars character Anakin Skywalker.
Aranakin also despises sand, claiming that it's coarse, rough, irritating and gets everywhere, which is a reference to Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, where Anakin complains about visiting his desert homeworld of Tatooine due to sand being "coarse and rough and irritating. And it gets everywhere."
Etymology[]
"Aranakin" may be derived from nakin (Sanskrit: नाकिन् "deity").
This is based on the interpretation that Aranaga and Aragaru, who are also involved in Agnihotra Sutra, are named after heavenly beings.
