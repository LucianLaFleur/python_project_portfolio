 Wine...
Media:VO Holderlin 01.ogg "Wine is a healthy drink!"

Dialogue[]

Holderlin: This wine really is better than tea at warming the gut and circulating the blood.
Moli: Wine, better than tea? Ha, I think you must have had too much to drink.
Holderlin: You just don't understand. Just a small cup of wine, and — ah! — it's like you've gone to heaven...
Holderlin: ...on the other hand, we have your Liyue tea. It's so bitter that it's hardly fit for human lips.
Moli: Heaven? Perhaps you're hallucinating. Why not try a trip to the Bubu Pharmacy?
Moli: The beauty of tea lies in the taste of sweetness that hides itself in the bitterness. Just like life, which has its ups and downs...
Holderlin: Oh, so a little drink of tea brings out the philosopher in you, eh?
Moli: And what of it? Tea is healthier than wine, after all.
Holderlin: Look at how yellow your teeth are from drinking tea all day. I don't see where the health comes from!
Moli: Why, you—

Trivia[]
Holderlin is a reference to German Romanticist philosopher Friedrich Hölderlin. During a Lantern Rite Event Quest he sits together with Caspar, who is in turn a reference to German Romanticist painter Caspar David Friedrich.
On the Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board, Holderin leaves an anonymous reply to the inn's (probably Landa's) post about wines from the "Morn Winery".
