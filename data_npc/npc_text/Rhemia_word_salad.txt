Dialogue[]

Rhemia: The morning crowd's larger than the afternoon one...
 What sort of crowd?
Rhemia: The sort that wear hats.
Rhemia: Different humans exhibit different behaviors. Some wear hats, and others don't. Same for drinking coffee, or being in a hurry...
Rhemia: I love categorizing them and summarizing the various patterns they follow.
Rhemia: For example, more people wear hats in the morning than in the afternoon. Do you know why that is?
Rhemia: From my observations, it seems that people are properly dressed when they head out in the morning.
Rhemia: But in the afternoon, after a day at work, they stop sweating the small details. They loosen their ties, take off their hats, and run out to the platforms happily.
 You're very meticulous.
Rhemia: Thank you. It seems to be a quality I possess...
Rhemia: Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Rhemia from the Marechaussee Phantom.
Rhemia: I'm on vacation right now, but I can go back into work mode at any time, if some emergency calls for it.
 See you.
Rhemia: See you.

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
Given that the names of Melusines are derived from fairy figures, "Rhemia" may be based on Lamia, a half-woman, half-snake being in Greek mythology, similar to the Melusine in European folklore.
