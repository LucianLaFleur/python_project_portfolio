Dialogue[]
Regular Dialogue[]

Donna: Are you here for the flowers?
 About Stormterror...
(Available between The Outlander Who Caught the Wind up until completing A Long Shot)
Donna: Every time I think that such a thing happened to us, I grow very afraid...
Donna: (If I were to be captured by Stormterror, Master Diluc would definitely come to my rescue...)
Donna: (This... This must be the part where the dashing prince saves the kidnapped princess!)
Donna: (Then... maybe our story will be written about in fairy tales... No, wait, why am I thinking about something like that now?)
Donna: W—Whatever it is, it was too terrifying for me. Oh, Lord Barbatos, please protect Mondstadt...
 Who are you?
Donna: ...Huh?
Donna: I'm just an ordinary girl... helping out here...
Donna: (Gosh, am I blushing?)
Donna: (I was daydreaming about Diluc giving me flowers... Was it obvious?)
Donna: Dont... don't look at me like that... There's nothing special about me.
 Diluc?
Donna: Oh... Did I just... say...?
Donna: I'm sorry...
Donna: I've been daydreaming about meeting Diluc here... so I...
Donna: No, I didn't...
Donna: (What do I do? I love Diluc so much!)
 Moon Pie?
Donna: Are you here... for the Moon Pies?
Donna: They are a specialty of Mondstadt, a kind of meat pie that is sweet and fulfilling.
Donna: (I could make a delicious Moon Pie and give it to Diluc...)
Donna: (Stop... stop it, Donna!)
Donna: If you have the chance, be sure to check them out!
 Sorry for bothering you.
Donna: I... I see...
Donna: Have a nice day.
Touch the Flowers[]
(Nighttime)
Donna: Hey! Miss Flora set out those flowers, you can't just pick any you want!

Event Dialogue[]
Invitation of Windblume[]

Donna: I wonder who will have the honor of offering the Windblume to Lord Barbatos this year?
Donna: Ah, I'm so envious. If only I could be the one. Everyone's eyes would be on me...
Donna: (And who knows? Maybe Diluc might notice me if I'm the one offering flowers...)
Donna: (That would be so wonderful... Oh gosh, he's all I can think about, isn't he...)

Windblume's Breath[]

Donna: I wonder who will have the honor of offering the Windblume to Lord Barbatos this year?
Donna: Ah, I'm so envious. If only I could be the one.
Donna: (If I had to pick a flower to give away, which one should I choose? Agh, what a dilemma...)
Donna: (Let me think of this a different way. If... If I want to find the flower that fits Master Diluc the most...)
Donna: (Gosh... Now all I can think about is Diluc...)
