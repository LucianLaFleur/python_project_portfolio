 A new prescription...
Media:VO Yiqing 01.ogg "Let's try a new prescription."

Dialogue[]

Yiqing: Guess I'll have to try a new prescription...
 You are...
Yiqing: I'm the physician in this area. Come find me anytime if you're feeling unwell.
Yiqing: You're young and full of fire, and ironically, that makes you more susceptible to illnesses in these mountains.
 Heatiness?
Yiqing: Heatiness is the root of all evil inside the body, and young people are especially prone to it, for their bodies are easily excited.
Yiqing: I have a few herbs to help quench the flames and vent the heat. Most effective when taken with herbal tea. Please help yourselves.
(Obtain  Qingxin ×1)
 Why are you trying new prescriptions?
Yiqing: There are no panaceas, so a good physician must find the right medicine to treat each patient's symptoms.
Yiqing: If the illness is complex, then we'll have to dig deep to find the ultimate prescription.
Yiqing: Well, all that assumes the physician has seen enough to be familiar with lots of different medicines, of course...
Yiqing: To master the effects of different prescriptions, I have to keep trying and learn from my mistakes.
 Goodbye.
Yiqing: Work out regularly, and keep a balanced diet.
