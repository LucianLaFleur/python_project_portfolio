Story[]
History[]
Moon Carver was among the adepti rallied by Morax, the Geo Archon, to fight in the Archon War. Either during this time or some time after the war's end, Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper were two of the three adepti who fought and sealed Azhdaha.[5]

Present[]
After the Stormterror Crisis was resolved, Venti informed the Traveler to head to Liyue to meet with Morax during the Rite of Descension or they would have to wait the following year.[6] When they arrived to witness the rite, they were instead greeted with Morax's corpse and labeled suspects due to being foreigners. The Traveler was able to escape with the help of Harbinger Childe, who suggested they speak to the adepti and gave them a Sigil of Permission to ensure the adepti would not attack them.[7]
Arriving in Jueyun Karst, Moon Carver was the first to greet the Traveler and Paimon. He was enraged to learn of Morax's supposed demise and that the Millelith had blamed foreigners without probable cause. At that moment, a group of Millelith pursuing the Traveler arrived, who they drove out per the adepti's request. After learning of the full situation, he sent them off to inform Mountain Shaper, Cloud Retainer and Xiao of the news.[8] Moon Carver later assisted the Millelith in defeating Osial[9] and agreed to let mortals govern Liyue, learning that Morax had simply stepped down from his role.[10]
During the second Lantern Rite without Morax, Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper went on a brief journey, returning to the mountains just as the fireworks festival was about to start in Liyue.[11] During the next Lantern Rite, they reunited with Morax (now in the form of Zhongli) and were joined by the Traveler and Paimon before enjoying some Bamboo Shoot Soup cooked with Cloud Retainer's adeptal mechanism.[12]
As the fourth Lantern Rite approached, Cloud Retainer, having assumed the human form of Xianyun, took up residence in Liyue Harbor and failed to visit him and Mountain Shaper, so the two also transformed into humans and went to the harbor hoping to find her. There, they were found by Paimon listening in on her talking with the Traveler, Keqing and Charlotte about kite-making with Fontaine's technology. Upon being confronted, Moon Carver revealed his identity but asked to be addressed as Houzhang, while Mountain Shaper named himself Jiehu. Paimon refused to believe them to be the adepti she knew, so they had to recount some of their previous experiences only known to them to convince her and the Traveler. Having learnt the theme of this year's Lantern Rite, they decided that Cloud Retainer was in no mood of greeting them due to her low opinion of mortal technology, and thus departed.[13]
Two days later, Houzhang and Jiehu were near Mt. Aocang when they tried out the Fontainian motor technology with a kite depicting the Jade Chamber and accidentally lost it. Having seen it drifting in the direction of the mountain, Jiehu was afraid it might be discovered by Xianyun, but Houzhang was confident that she would not be out in the vicinity. Unbeknownst to them, Xianyun was running a kite-making workshop and happened to intercept the kite, which prompted her to go investigate at once. The two became flustered the moment she appeared in person, and after some private exchange, decided to play dumb, but Paimon then arrived with the Traveler and immediately exposed their identities. Xianyun, however, claimed she had long known. They tried to flatter her mechanical prowess, but she dismissed them and left. They then determined to continue flying the kite at Mt. Hulao.[14]
Having learnt of the discord between Gaming and his father Yip Tak that arose from the former's career choices, Xianyun was eager to help them resolve their differences in light of the festive occasion, and thus in the next two days enlisted the help of Houzhang and Jiehu, asking them to play the roles of Treasure Hoarders pretending to attack Gaming while escorting goods in the presence of his father. When the plan was carried out, Gaming was quick to defend himself and even prepared to strike first, so Houzhang and Jiehu retreated with the intention of luring him away. While pursuing them, Gaming astutely sensed from their actual abilities that they weren't usual ruthless bandits, and deduced that it had been staged. The plans however were ultimately successful, and when the festivities at Liyue Harbor began, Houzhang and Jiehu watched as Yip Tak enjoyed Gaming's Wushou Dance.[15]

There was one year when it snowed heavily in Liyue, and Mt. Aocang was covered in several feet of snow. Seeing everyone cooped up in their abodes with nothing to do, one created a Snowdrift Mechanism for skiing on the mountains. One was having a tremendous time of it along with Guizhong and Streetward Rambler... until, of course, Moon Carver noticed as much and decided to join in. Moments later, he had managed to send the mechanism flying off the rails and plummeted deep into a snow bank. It took us hours to dig him out... Later, one introduced a great many safety features to the mechanism, to the point where it could be safely piloted by even a three-year-old child. Although this did entail a compromise on the top speed of the vehicle.MailsSenderMailsShenheBirth Date... (Birthday Mail)XiaoIf You Have Time... (Birthday Mail)
Trivia[]
During the Closed Beta Tests, Moon Carver's name was translated as "Perfected Lord of Descending Sun and Ascending Moon," which was a more direct translation of his original Chinese name.
The title "Perfected Lord" (Chinese: 真君 Zhēnjūn) is typically ascribed to the xian (Taoist immortals), whom the adepti are modeled after.
Based on the Chinese version of Xingqiu's Voice-Over, "Interesting Things...", Moon Carver may have rescued him from a perilous situation in the past.
Moon shares his English voice actor, Zach Aguilar, with Aether.
Moon Carver is mentioned in the description of the following Furnishing: Sub-Space Cabochon: In Soaring Flight
