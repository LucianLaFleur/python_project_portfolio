Profile[]
Fujin, along with Herblord, was once the servant of an unnamed god. She was also good friends with Herblord and Lingyuan. Originally a giant golden carp who lived in the rivers of Chenyu Vale, Fujin was worshiped as an adeptus during her lifetime and was known to be close to humanity — she took on a human form and conducted the Rainjade Rite, an ancient ritual which “changed” the water veins and soil of Chenyu Vale and made them more palatable to humans. She also planted the first tea tree, which would one day grow the same tea leaves that Chenyu Vale would come to be known for.[1]
When the Archon War came to Liyue, Fujin’s master caused the Bishui River to flood in a final attempt to defeat Morax, an act which would have destroyed Chenyu Vale. Seeing this, Fujin and Herblord defected against their god, banding together to save the people of Chenyu Vale. While Lingyuan herded them to shelter, Herblord fought against their former master, and Fujin climbed Mt. Lingmeng and hurled the Votive Rainjade into the waters. Their collective efforts would save Chenyu Vale; however, Herblord perished during the battle, and Fujin “sank into the sea,” losing much of her strength. She would be trapped at Carp’s Rest for thousands of years, only able to reminisce about the outside world through the scent of tea offerings.[1]
Eventually, when the Traveler first steps foot in Chenyu Vale, they encounter Fujin, who explains that the soil and waters of the vale are on the decline, putting Qiaoying Village in danger as they were experiencing bad tea harvests. The Traveler agrees to help her in performing the Rainjade Rite to restore the land, and she loans them some of her powers so they could traverse the land. During the events of the World Quest series, Fujin is shocked to discover that her friend Lingyuan was responsible for damaging the environment. Once she was brought back to her senses, Fujin performed the rite, restoring the soil and water, though the miasma brought about by Lingyuan's tampering of the spirit lines would still persist. The act also caused her to lose much of her energy, reverting her back to her original form as a carp.
Collecting all the Spirit Carp in Chenyu Vale and maximizing the level of Rainjade's Benediction will cause Fujin to accumulate enough energy to regain her human form. She can then be found in several locations around Chenyu Vale, such as looking over Qiaoying Village.

Appearance[]
Fujin takes the appearance of a fair-skinned young woman with long black hair, green eyes, green earrings, and a yellow diamond marking on her forehead. Her hair is tied into loops with a Jin hairpin, the end of which is styled as light green fish fins with a golden underside. She wears a yellow dress that fades to green. The front of the top layer of her dress is split and lined with a dark orange hemline, with a white layer underneath.
