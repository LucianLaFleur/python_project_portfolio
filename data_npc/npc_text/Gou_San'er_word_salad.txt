Dialogue[]

Gou San'er: Oi, you! Sneaking around here... Explain yourself!
 I'm just passing by.
Gou San'er: Passing by, eh...
Gou San'er: You listen here. Don't you get any ideas about this warehouse, capisce!? I've got my eye on you...
 Oh. Is this warehouse a big deal?
Gou San'er: Put it like this. See them boats out in the harbor? Big ones, little ones, don't matter if they's comin' or goin'... Well, all the goods and all the drinking water they have on board goes through this here warehouse. So yes, it's a big deal!
Gou San'er: And with me here to keep an eye on things, I can guarantee you it's also the safest warehouse in the world!
Gou San'er: The rocks this place is built from, believe you me... they ain't gonna budge come hell or high water. Safety guaranteed! You're a traveler, right? Must have seen the world? Tell me, have you been to Sumeru?
Gou San'er: I hear the warehouses they've got over there are nothing more than straw huts! You tryin' to tell me that's safe!? Well lemme tell you something! If you had four of me guarding it, then yeah! It would be safe!
 I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to trespass or anything.
Gou San'er: Well, as long as you weren't gonna try anything... And if you weren't... Sorry for lecturing you.
