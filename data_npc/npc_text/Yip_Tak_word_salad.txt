Yip Tak is the father of Gaming. He married Gaming's mother, who came from outside the village. His ancestors were tea farmers for several generations, though by the time Tak took over the family business they were only primarily selling tea leaves.[2]
During Gaming's childhood, Tak showed Gaming a wushou dance, causing him to become interested in wushou dancing and wanting to pursue a career as a professional dancer. Tak did not approve of the decision, as he wanted Gaming to succeed him in his small-scale tea business. The two nearly went into a fistfight until Gaming ran away from home, going to Yilong Wharf to look for employment of his own. While Tak's wife supported Gaming's decision, Tak was more stubborn, which his wife believed was him just being worried over his son's future. Eventually, Tak's wife passed away from unknown causes, leaving Tak the sole operator of his business.
During the events of Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze, the Traveler and Paimon learn of Gaming's situation with Tak and informs Xianyun, Ganyu and Shenhe of his problem. Xianyun, not wanting the problem to manifest into a regret, takes matters into her own hands by concocting a plan to get the two to reconcile with each other. Having Charlotte buy Tak's merchandise, Tak would request the Secure Transport Agency to help bring his wares to Liyue Harbor. Gaming took the job, but became surprised when he learns that the person he was escorting was his father. On the way to Wangshu Inn, the group is ambushed by Mountain Shaper and Moon Carver, posing as bandits to draw Gaming away. They soon run into Zhongli, and during a conversation with him, Tak expresses his worry about his son's future as the tea business was stable. Zhongli tells him that he should let Gaming choose his own path; by the time Gaming returns, Tak explains his reason as to why he opposed him living in the city.
Upon arriving at the harbor, Tak meets Charlotte and talks with her over the merchandise, which was planned so that she would bring them back to Fontaine and grow an interest in his product. As the Lantern Rite commences, Tak watches his son perform a spectacular wushou dance and later informs him that he no longer opposes his decision to be a professional dancer, causing Gaming to hug him in response.[3]
