Profile[]
Horrer was a member of the House of the Hearth. He obtained a scar across his face during one of his missions, and Lyney claimed that one look at his face would drive away a potential lover. However, he eventually fell in love with someone and tried to escape the House to be with them but was caught, and Arlecchino promptly executed him for betrayal, with his name being complied on an execution list.
However, due to an impressive showcase of strength and/or determination, Arlecchino instead offered him another way out by giving him a potion of her searing flames. Horrer took the potion and survived, with all of his memories pertaining to the House removed. He would eventually find a job as a newsboy.
While accompanying Arlecchino to Palais Mermonia, Horrer ran into the Traveler and apologized to them, before Arlecchino bought three papers off him. The Traveler noted that he looked familiar, but did not make the connection until after their duel against Arlecchino.
