Dialogue[]

Rena: Machines make work easier, but there's something rather boring about them.
 Wanna chat?
Rena: Sure, but where should we start...?
Rena: I was just thinking that I should meet up with a friend at the opera house on my off day — we can watch an opera or a trial, either is fine with me.
Rena: I've been on duty at the harbor lately, and I've been inspecting machines on the regular, day in and day out — nothing special.
Rena: But thinking about it a different way, boring work might be meaningless, but at least it's safe.
Rena: If I were still dispatched to the Fontaine Research Institute for further studies in mechanical knowledge, I might no longer have legs to touch land, you know?
 What if I want to take a boat to the Court of Fontaine...
Rena: Ah, you speak of the aquabuses that travel along Fontaine's waterways, eh?
Rena: This is the starting point of the Clementine Line, which heads from Romaritime Harbor to the Court of Fontaine.
Rena: If you want to take one of those boats to the Court, just take a seat on that long bench, and one will arrive shortly.
Rena: The Melusine tour guide on board will introduce you to... some assorted trivia, so stay tuned.
 See you.
Rena: Take care!
