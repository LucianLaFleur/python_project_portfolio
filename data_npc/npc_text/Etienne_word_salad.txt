Dialogue[]

Etienne: Good girl, Baguette, good girl... Phew.
 What are you busy with?
Etienne: ...Oh, sorry. I'm just... really tired right now. Didn't notice you there.
Etienne: Very few people talk to me at work, in any case, since cargo inspection doesn't really involve the crew.
Etienne: And as you can see, that's what I'm doing.
Etienne: Though in practice, the one inspecting things is my dog, Baguette. I'm just here to take care of her in turn.
 Mind telling me about your dog?
Etienne: Ah. Baguette is an earnest girl who's dedicated to her work. I'm most fond of her.
Etienne: She's got a truly keen sense of smell, and she can sniff out all manner of contraband and prohibited items.
Etienne: No human inspector can beat her in that regard, but...
Etienne: Baguette is tireless at work, and just as tireless when it comes to tearing the house down.
Etienne: *sigh* If only she could be this at peace at home.
(Available after Step 9 of Soloist's Prologue)
 Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
Etienne: Ah, yes, thanks for sending me the Magic Pocket earlier.
Etienne: Whether the prophecy is true or not, the pocket remains a very convenient storage tool.
Etienne: I should probably stuff all the valuables at home into it. Even if I don't have to move, I can avoid their damage at Baguette's hands.
(Available after completing The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur)
 About the prophecy...
Etienne: Please, allow me to thank you again for the Magic Pocket you gave me earlier! It's extremely convenient for storage.
Etienne: Luckily, I'd already stuffed all my home's most valuable things in there. When the waters rose, everyone was so busy with rescue efforts that there wasn't time for anything else.
Etienne: But I still haven't taken out the stuff I put in, hehe... After all, Baguette can't break what's inside.
 See you.
Etienne: *sigh* See you.
