 ...Offering incense?
Media:VO Pingshan 01.ogg "I see you're a guest from afar. Would you like my help in offering incense?"

Dialogue[]

Pingshan: You come from a faraway place. How about lighting a Crane Crown Incense for good luck?
 "Crane Crown Incense"?
Pingshan: Look, there's a stone hanging over the cliff of the Yilong Dais, like the head of a crane.
Pingshan: If you light one at the censer there, the adepti will hear your wish. Works every time, trust me on that!
Pingshan: The trip to the crane's head isn't for the faint-hearted, though. Many guests lost their composure as soon as they looked down.
Pingshan: That's why we now have a proxy service.
Pingshan: It'll cost you the equivalent of two cups of tea, but you get a wish that'll come true. Not a bad deal, right?
 Do the people of Chenyu Vale also believe in the Crane Adepti?
Pingshan: Good question! I once had the same doubts, which I asked my master about.
Pingshan: He just said that all adepti who can protect the people are good adepti, whether they be Carp, Crane, or Deer.
Pingshan: So I stopped thinking about it. After all, they're just legends. No one knows if they're real or fabricated.
Pingshan: But if sincerity brings good luck, then that's all that matters!
 You are?
Pingshan: I'm the owner of this tea stall, and I'm also in charge of cleaning the Yilong Dais daily.
Pingshan: This place used to be full of tourists. I took over this job from my master almost twenty years ago, and I've lit the Crane Crown Incense for countless guests.
Pingshan: Whether it was the popularity of this place causing all sorts of paintings and photos to circulate, or maybe too many people had heard of or seen this place for themselves already...
Pingshan: But either way, it's not as appealing as before. Things haven't been as busy as it was years ago.
Pingshan: But times change. No point crying over that.
Pingshan: I plan to recruit an apprentice, so they can carry this tradition forward.
Pingshan: Then I want to make time to find several writers to write about the Yilong Dais, and promote our stories.
Pingshan: For all I know, more people might realize that coming to the Yilong Dais to light a Crane Crown Incense will really make their wishes come true.
 Not right now, thanks though!
Pingshan: Farewell! If you want to make a wish, come find me or my future apprentice anytime!
