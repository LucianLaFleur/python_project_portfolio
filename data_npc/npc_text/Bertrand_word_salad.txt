Profile[]
Bertrand is a toymaker hailing from Fontaine, hoping to reach into the Inazuma market. Due to a hasty attempt to quickly break into the market, however, he created explosive toys, which got the Tenryou Commission involved. His toys were confiscated and he paid a hefty fine as a result, forcing him to borrow money from Kurisu to keep his project going. He placed a commission with the Adventurers' Guild to hire an assistant, a job Katheryne passed onto the Traveler and Paimon.

Dialogue Set #1[]

(During Core of the Apparatus)
Bertrand: Heh! If that's the amount I'm getting for one of these, then I just need to sell 20,000 of them to pay off my debt!
Bertrand: What's up, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? Is there something wrong?

Bertrand: Ohhh, have you collected all the materials? Let me activate the Great Machine for you!
(Opens Product Creation)
 I'd like to pick a toy to keep. (Unlocked after completing Mass Production)
Bertrand: Oho! Have you toy models you'd like to redeem? Just roll up with your redemption voucher, then... Though as we said before, you can only redeem four...
(Opens "Test Products to Redeem")
 So about the creation process...
Bertrand: Ah, sure. I can explain that again, no problem.
Bertrand: You have to collect the materials needed for the three processes while carrying the Collector on your person.
Bertrand: The second step is "Elemental Charge," which can only be achieved by staying affected by the elements for a certain duration.
Bertrand: Finally, we have "Core Activation," which can be done by defeating some elemental life forms to achieve the motive force required to start the core up.
Bertrand: After this, the Material Collector should have finished collecting all we need. Then, it just needs to be placed into the Great Machine to begin production.
Bertrand: If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me.
 Let's have a look at our production record... (Unlocked after completing Mass Production)

 No, nothing at the moment.
Bertrand: Well, then keep flexing those creative muscles of yours! Honestly, I'm very much looking forward to seeing what else you'll make!
