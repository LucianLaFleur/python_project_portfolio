Jeht was friends with Bleda, and would pester him to go feed the crocodiles together.[1] He was kind to both Jeht and Babel, but for unknown reasons Babel considered him a threat to her objectives. She ordered Jeht to kill him, which she did by stabbing him with a poisoned dagger.[2] Bleda's name appears struck out on the Crumpled Namelist in Jeht's tent in the Tanit Camps.
