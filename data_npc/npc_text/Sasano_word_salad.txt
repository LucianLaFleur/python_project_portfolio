 But the original...

Dialogue[]

Sasano: Ah, for her sake, should I...
 You seem to be troubled by something...
Sasano: My outlander friend, have you ever experienced this before? Feeling like your whole world has become brighter after meeting someone?
Sasano: Ah... Sorry. That must sound a little bit cringey...
Sasano: But this is how I really feel.
Sasano: After I met her, I even wanted to leave my hometown and follow her to the unknown beyond...
 "Her"?
(Before completing Transient Dreams)

Sasano: Yeah, this girl is from Liyue, someone I had a fated encounter with not long ago.
Sasano: She's cheerful, clever, and carefree. She is completely different from me, someone who has spent his entire life in Inazuma. When I was with her, I felt like my whole world was becoming different.
Sasano: I often wonder if I should leave Inazuma with her and set out on a journey that I have never imagined before...
Sasano: But I'm supposed to be the successor of my family business. It's going to be very hard for me to give up on my duties and just leave...
Sasano: Ah, what should I do...
(After completing Transient Dreams)

Sasano: Yeah, this girl is from Liyue, someone I had a fated encounter with not long ago.
Sasano: She's cheerful, clever, and carefree. She is completely different from me, someone who has spent his entire life in Inazuma. When I was with her, I felt like my whole world was becoming different.
Sasano: Someday, she'll set out on a new adventure, and then... Should I follow her lead and take a step ahead too?
Sasano: Living in Inazuma and continuing the family business is my safest bet, but I know in my heart that I'd regret it if I let her go...
 Goodbye.
Sasano: Goodbye... I should really put more thought into this...

Hues of the Violet Garden[]

(Talk to Sasano or Tingting after completing The Strange Tale of Suikou's Tipsy Tincture)
Tingting: Have you finished reading the fan novel that we bought together?
Sasano: Yup, more or less...
Tingting: Wasn't it great? I loved the ending, the way in which the female lead chose to stride towards her new life, convictions in hand!
Sasano: You know, although the plotline at the start was very exciting, I remember that this wasn't the original ending...
Tingting: *sigh* I guess that's the freedom of fan works for you.
Tingting: Getting to see all sorts of characters' stories in fan works is exactly their charm.
Sasano: ...That's true, that's true. You've got a point there...
Sasano: Also, I've heard that a new picture book's come out over there. Wanna go have a look?
