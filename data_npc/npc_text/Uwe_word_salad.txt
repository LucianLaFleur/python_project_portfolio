Uwe is a Treasure Hoarder who operates around Mondstadt. His modus operandi is to fake injuries in order to take advantage of unsuspecting travelers who try to help him.[1] However, Uwe was left badly injured for real after encountering a group of monsters, and travelers (wary of his claims) refused to help him. Uwe eventually encountered the Traveler and Barbara after they defeated some Hilichurls in the Whispering Woods while searching for Sweet Flowers. Pleading for Barbara to heal him, he claimed to be a hunter from Springvale who got injured after being attacked by monsters in the forest.
Depending on the chosen dialogue, he will either confess that he is a Treasure Hoarder, yet still express his gratitude to Barbara for healing his injuries and repay her in kind by giving her some Sweet Flowers,[1] or if the Traveler decides to take him to the Knights of Favonius for being a suspicious person, Uwe will accuse the Traveler of bluffing in which he reveals his ulterior motive, thus eventually causing him to be defeated and run away. Despite that, Barbara still feels slight remorse for his injuries.[2]

Appearance[]
Uwe appears as a Treasure Hoarders: Marksman, but without the bandana while in dialogue.
