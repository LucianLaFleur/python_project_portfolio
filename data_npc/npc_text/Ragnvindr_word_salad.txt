Ragnvindr the Dawn Knight was a historical figure who lived during Mondstadt's Aristocratic period one thousand years ago. Originally one of the knights that obeyed the Mondstadt Aristocracy, a chance encounter with the Dawnlight Swordswoman of the Wanderer's Troupe and subsequent befriending of her led him to eventually join Vennessa's rebellion.
The Ragnvindr Family, the owners of the Dawn Winery, are his descendants.

Profile[]
Ragnvindr was born into the upper echelons of Mondstadt society during the Aristocratic period, which saw large social stratification. However, he grew dissatisfied with the way the city was run, a feeling that only intensified after meeting the Dawnlight Swordswoman.[1] He decided to turn his back on his former way of life, devoting himself to Vennessa's cause when she raised the flag of rebellion.[2]
Ballads of the Squire are said to be songs written by Ragnvindr himself.

Story[]
Vennessa's Rebellion[]
As a knight for the aristocracy, Ragnvindr grew disillusioned by their apathy towards the suffering of the common people. When the Wanderer's Troupe's rebellion was crushed by the aristocracy, the Dawnlight was enslaved and turned into a gladiator. Despite losing all her hope and her friends, she continued to sing of freedom, and her words strengthened Ragnvindr's resolve to fight against the aristocracy. Ragnvindr bore witness to her death in her final battle and buried her along with her sword, The Flute. He was inspired to chose the title of "Dawn Knight" for himself after her own "Dawnlight."[2]
When Vennessa led a rebellion against the aristocracy with Barbatos' assistance, Ragnvindr participated as her ally. After the rebellion emerged victorious, Ragnvindr transformed the aristocrats' indoor baths into the Mondstadt Library.[3] It is unknown whether he joined the Knights of Favonius after its establishment.

Legacy[]
Ragnvindr tended to the Dawn Winery during his lifetime, although it is unknown whether the winery's history began with him.[4] The winery remains in operation to the present day.
Two of his known descendants are Crepus and Diluc.

Trivia[]
The Red-Haired Warrior who fought alongside the Nameless Bard, Barbatos, and Amos is very likely Ragnvindr's ancestor.[5]
Etymology[]
The name Ragnvindr may be derived from the Old Norse words regin (gods) + vindr (wind), meaning "Wind God."
