Orupeusu's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Here lies Orupeusu no Mikoto, who was skilled in music as a youth, specializing in playing the lyre. His voice was so lovely that even the very earth would be moved.—The Royal Tomb of Orupeusu
Orupeusu was one of the seven Sunchildren, and one of the two who were raised by Clymene. The night before his Rite of Solar Return, Orupeusu intuited his impending doom and begged Clymene to sing for him, going as far as to swear to never sing until he heard her voice. Because she was sworn not to speak to the Sunchildren, Clymene ultimately refused his requests, something that would burden her with immense regret.[1]
After Clymene activates the Soul Guide's Locus and successfully summons the Sunchildren's spirits, the memories of Enkanomiya's people of the Sunchildren as transgressors allowed them to be left behind as Shades of Tokoyo. When approached, Orupeusu correctly infers that the Traveler is searching for someone and wishes them the best of luck, although he refuses to sing for them due to his oath to Clymene.[2]

Appearance[]
Like the other child Shades of Tokoyo, he is a translucent childlike figure without defining physical features.

Etymology[]
Orupeusu is likely derived from Orpheus, a figure in Greek mythology known for playing the lyre and for attempting and failing to rescue his wife Eurydice from the underworld. One version of Orpheus's backstory has him be a son of the Greek sun god Apollo, fitting with the naming scheme of the other Sunchildren.
