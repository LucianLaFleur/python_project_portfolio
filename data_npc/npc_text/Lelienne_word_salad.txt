 So much potential...

Dialogue[]

Lelienne: Hey there, friend! Want to change your life?
 What are you talking about?
Lelienne: You might find this hard to imagine, but many people in this world would love a chance to restart their lives.
Lelienne: But a little change to one's appearance can halve the difficulty — and that's my specialty, see?
Lelienne: There's a bright future ahead for this sort of research, and you look like the sort of person with an eye on the future, so, would you consider sponsoring me?
Lelienne: I'm a proper engineer from the Fontaine Research Institute, you know? ... Well, I was, anyway.
 That sounds suspicious. What happened? Tell me the truth.
Lelienne: Alright, alright. Gah, it really does seem like I've got no talent for pulling in investors...
Lelienne: But I really was an engineer at the Institute once, and it was my goal to use machines to pursue the apex of aesthetics.
Lelienne: But an... accident happened, resulting in some damage to one of my colleagues' appearance.
Lelienne: And when I returned from my stint at the Fortress of Meropide, I started living here.
Lelienne: They told me that Fleuve Cendre was a bit of a gray area, and that I might be able to secure some funding here.
Lelienne: But as it turns out, that's not the case at all! The Spina di Rosula watches everyone here like hawks, you see...
 I'm fine, thank you.
Lelienne: Alright, looks like my pitch didn't work out... again...
