Profile[]
Kosekimaru hails from Seirai Island and once sailed as part of Ako Domeki's fleet during his rebellion against the Shogunate. He was never able to communicate with his sailors.
Kosekimaru ended up on the Golden Apple Archipelago during a battle with a Shogunate vessel at Seirai Island when Ako Domeki had seized a Maguu Kenki on board after being struck by lightning from the Thunder Manifestation, and all of his sailors have drifted back to land. A part of Kosekimaru's remains was crafted by the local children into a sword made in the likeness of the Maguu Kenki's, while the rest of the wreck was stationed at the island between Twinning and Pudding Isle where a xylophone was also created from his remains.
Eventually, a group of Fatui would travel to the Golden Apple Archipelago and activate a dream-manipulating machine, resurrecting Kosekimaru in the form of a Waverider and granting him sapience. The Traveler, Paimon, Fischl, Mona, Xinyan, and Kaedehara Kazuha encounter Kosekimaru and are able to talk to him after spending one day on the archipelago. As he originally could not remember his name, Paimon names him "Miitoboru," taking his Inazuman origins into consideration.
Days after, the effects of the Fatui's machine on the island have started to fade. During this time, Miitoboru remembers his past and the name given to him by Asase Hibiki, "Kosekimaru" from the Koseki Village.[1]

Appearance[]
Kosekimaru's appearance in the Golden Apple Archipelago is of the standard Waverider appearance. His window panels light up with blue when he speaks.
The design of Kosekimaru's (and all Waverider's) bow is based on the Thunder Manifestation.

Approaching a floating hilichurl camp[]

Miitoboru: "Aren't those hilichurls? Are they seriously everywhere nowadays?"
Miitoboru: "We ocean wayfarers fear no battle! Lay on! We'll take 'em all on, and beat 'em too!"
Miitoboru: "These hilichurls... How did they get out here at sea, anyway? Did they drift over?"

Getting stuck in a whirlpool[]

Miitoboru: "Well, this is troublesome... Full speed ahead, I say!"
Miitoboru: "We'll charge right through this puny whirlpool!"
Miitoboru: "Let's get out of here. I'm not doing so good..."

Approaching a Cloudleisure Step[]

Miitoboru: "That floating thing over there sure looks like a jellyfish. Hope it isn't poisonous..."
Miitoboru: "Hmm. Could we stand on top of that floaty thing over there?"
Miitoboru: "I must confess, watching that jellyfish-like thing float in the air makes me want to try it too..."

Approaching Broken Isle[]

Miitoboru: "This island fell silent a long time ago. But I've been hearing music from it again recently..."

Approaching the islands north of Broken Isle[]

Miitoboru: "I just get this feeling that this particular island is affecting this entire ocean region. It could be a very dangerous place. Be careful, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)."

While this line seems intended to appear before repairing the Cognitive Mimicry during Like Rhyme and Song, the Summer Reverie. It can also be triggered after repairing it.
After repairing the Cognitive Mimicry[]

Miitoboru: "Did you do something, (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler)? This island's influence has decreased a lot. I think that the surrounding seas should return to normal soon..."

Approaching the island midway between Twinning Isle and Pudding Isle[]
After completing Treasure Voyage:

Miitoboru: "This is where my hull's rear is... Seriously, it's so far from the front half. What in the world happened to me back then..."

Approaching the island midway between Twinning Isle and Broken Isle[]
After completing Treasure Voyage:

Miitoboru: "That's my hull's front half. How did it get all the way up there? What was it trying to do, reach a new high?"

Approaching the partially submerged ruins south of Minacious Isle[]
Miitoboru: "The starry sky here truly is beautiful. Back in Inazuma, our vision would often be blocked by either clouds or thunder..."‍[is this the correct trigger condition?]
This line is available as soon as Travelers gain the ability to understand Miitoboru.
This line will play as soon as the location is approached for the first time, regardless of the time of day.
Approaching Minacious Isle[]
Prior to completing As the Courtyard in Spring Once Appeared (Part 1)

Miitoboru: "I can't put my finger on it, but this island has a rather... mysterious atmosphere..."

Approaching Pudding Isle[]
Hoverlight Rocks: Left & Hoverlight Rocks: Right

Miitoboru: "Huh! Those are Inazuman mountains... But something's a bit off here."

Leisurely Rocks: Left & Leisurely Rocks: Right

Miitoboru: "Where are these mountains from? I've never seen anything like them..."

Unyielding Rocks: Left & Unyielding Rocks: Right

Miitoboru: "Never seen these trees before, either... Wait a moment. Were the mountains on this island always like this?"

Trivia[]
Miitoboru is the romanized transliteration of the English word "meatball" into Japanese.
One way of saying "meatball" in Japanese ends in 丸 maru, which is a common Japanese suffix for names, including ship names. (Paimon's observation in English that Inazuman ships end in -ru is incomplete.)
Similarly, the word "meatball" in Chinese ends with the same character seen in the other -maru names.
In Teyvat, the suffix can be found in the names of Kosekimaru himself, "Seiraimaru" (the only other known named Inazuman ship), Masagomaru, Konbumaru, and Akuoumaru.
