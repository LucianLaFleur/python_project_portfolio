Dialogue[]

Atiyah: Friend! A moment, please! You look like someone of skill. Would you be interested in joining the Eremites?

(If the player loses the match)

Atiyah: Oh, wow. I think I got lucky there, so don't worry about it.
(If the player wins the match)

Atiyah: Ow, ow, ow. You're really strong, huh... Bet you'd do real well as an Eremite...
 Does it come with benefits?
Atiyah: Oh, lots!
Atiyah: First, this is one of the few ways you can get out of Aaru Village.
Atiyah: Get out of this desolate dump, and the world will be your oyster! Every young and ambitious soul longs to see the world, no?
Atiyah: And we might all be people of the desert, sure, but you can bet that we know how to wrangle Mora off those tree-dwellers!
Atiyah: Those from the Akademiya have the fattest wallets. They never quibble over prices or delay payments.
Atiyah: You just need to take one of their commissions, and you'll be set!
Atiyah: You won't find a better Mora-making venture anywhere else!
 I'll give that some thought.
Atiyah: ...Well, other than the stuff I mentioned earlier, our food is just the best! If you don't believe me, just try this!
Atiyah: The way we treat our people is beyond reproach. That much I can guarantee!
(Obtain  Shawarma Wrap ×3)
 I've got other things to do at the moment.
Atiyah: Oh? Are you sure there are better things to do than being a mercenary?
Atiyah: Well, that's a right shame, but you can always come back to me if you change your mind!
