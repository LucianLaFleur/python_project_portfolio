  Mentioned Characters 




Kanna Kapatcir (Ainu: カンナカパッチㇼ Kanna Kapatcir), also known as the Great Thunderbird[1] or just the Thunderbird, was a powerful monster[2][3] that was misunderstood as the guardian of Tsurumi Island. She was responsible for the island's destruction and the death of all its citizens, as well as the destruction of Seirai Island. She was eventually killed by Ei and sealed away at Seirai Island. The remnants of her power either summoned or formed the Thunder Manifestation.

The Thunderbird was still a monster that cared not for the worship of mankind. They knew it not, and regarded the unpredictable actions of the Thunderbird as divine revelations. Yet thunder was its breath, as were the fates of men. From the sky, men were no different from animals.—Description from the Thundering Fury artifact set
Appearance[]
Kanna Kapatcir was a tremendous female bird of prey with violet feathers and may or may not have glowing red eyes[4] though these traits are not verified nor is her appearance ever shown.[5] She allegedly bears a resemblance to the much smaller Oz though no connection is shown. The name given to her by Ruu suggests that she was an eagle.[1]

Story[]
History[]
Kanna Kapatcir was an entity that lived long ago. Her age is not known, but she was given a name by "her," although she had forgotten both it and the person who gave her the name.
Thousands of years ago, Kapatcir noticed that some "strange objects" fell from the heavens and landed upon Tsurumi Island, producing the fog. However, she ignored the fog, even though she had the power to disperse it.[6] Afterwards, an ancient tribe living on Tsurumi Island worshipped Kapatcir. Simultaneously fearful of her and thankful for her blessings, they chose shamans to offer blood sacrifices for protection and blessings. They would also interpret any of her actions as divine revelations and used an amethyst hourglass to predict her arrival and hold a festival when she arrived. The tribe believed that she placed a dense fog to "protect" them from the "sea of darkness" outside the island.
However, she paid no attention to them, seeing them as no different from animals and living a short life. One day a young boy's song broke through the clouds and captivated her. She landed next to the boy and the two talked briefly. The boy introduced himself as Ruu and decided to give her the name "Kanna Kapatcir". Ruu promised to sing to Kapatcir again and they departed.
Unfortunately, when Kapatcir returned, she saw the boy dead and his blood within the sacrificial cup. While Ruu thought that his sacrifice was for the good of the tribe, she only saw the murder of an innocent and the breaking of a promise. Driven mad from rage and sorrow, she razed the entire mountain with lightning, killing everyone in the tribe to avenge the boy. She left the mountain but placed a curse on the land that would only be lifted when she could hear his song once more.[7]

Death[]
Years later, Kapatcir was hunted down as a monster and killed[7] by Ei for being "an obstacle to progress,"[4] possibly meaning that she was a danger to her people at Seirai Island. The remnants of her power were sealed at Asase Shrine, where they formed a coagulation of regret.[8]
A thousand years later, Asase Hibiki released the barrier, unleashing the Thunder Manifestation upon the Raiden Shogun's ships,[5] unintentionally destroying and fragmenting the island and sweeping some ships far out to sea, with a particular fleet becoming stranding at the remote Golden Apple Archipelago. Another Thunder Manifestation appeared in the hollow of Mt. Kanna, born from Kapatcir's rage, after the Traveler and Paimon brought Ruu back to the location where he was sacrificed.[1] However, now knowing the truth, Ruu went to Seirai Island and sang to the Thunder Manifestation. With the promise they made now fulfilled, another feather manifested in front of Ruu, a sign that even in death, Kapatcir had heard his song once more and lifted the curse on the island.

Trivia[]
Kanna (Ainu: カンナ) is the Ainu word for "upper" or "above" and part of "Kanna-kamuy" the name of the Ainu kamuy (deity) of thunder of lightning; while Kapatcir (Ainu: カパッチㇼ) is the Ainu word for "eagle", typically referring to the Steller's sea eagle (Haliaeetus pelagicus). Together, Kanna Kapatcir's name either means literally "upper eagle" or metaphorically "thunder eagle".
According to the English subtitles for The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna, Kanna Kapatcir (Ainu: カンナカパッチㇼ) translates to "Great Eagle of the Storm."[1]
Kapatcir is also referred to as a "violet glede" in the description of Hamayumi.[5] A glede is a type of bird of prey.
In Ainu folklore, the Steller's sea eagle is deified as the kamuy (god) Kapatcir-kamuy.
Kapatcir is mentioned in the description of the following Furnishing: Replica Mural: Ancient Ritual in a Sea of Fog
Despite being identified as an eagle in most of her lore, the Thunderbird is called an "owl" in Narukami's Affection and in the Chinese version of Octave of the Maushiro, when Sango describes her as "monstrous bird of thunder" (Chinese: 雷之魔枭 "demon owl of thunder").
