Chaoxi's location (Nighttime)Additional context
Profile[]
Chaoxi is a sailor and a playboy who has begun — and abandoned — romantic relationships with multiple women across Teyvat, and is currently going between Cui'er[1] and Sisi.[2] He is also likely the "heartless sailor" from Liyue who once broke Taraneh's heart by cheating on her, leading her to dream of someday taking revenge on him.[3] Another woman leaves a message on the Yilong Wharf Bulletin Board, who prays to Fujin for Chaoxi's protection and to "bring him back home."[4]
Sisi's infatuation with Chaoxi caught Chang the Ninth's attention in the past. While conducting research for a "gushy romance" in the Liyue Commission A Novel Idea, Chang can send the Traveler to covertly listen in on their conversation and report it back to him. After they do so, Chang judges that "Something's not right with this Chaoxi chap... Wait, no, I take it back. Something's wrong with both of them," and predicts that the Millelith are likely going to end up "picking up the pieces" of their relationship.

Dialogue[]

Sisi: Chaoxi, you've finally returned! Let's settle our engagement plans while you're back this time, what do you say?
Chaoxi: Sisi, I literally just got back from sea and I'm completely drained, mentally and physically. Let's talk about it later...
Sisi: But that's what you said last time, and before I knew it you were running off with some other girl...
Chaoxi: Come now, don't be that way. We're just friends, nothing more.
Sisi: If you two are just friends, then what are you so worried about? Why can't we get engaged?
Chaoxi: There you go again! I don't have any intention of getting married yet. It's not that I can't shoulder the responsibility, Sisi, it's just that I don't want to disappoint you, that's all.
Chaoxi: I'm a sailor and the sea is always calling me, there's no escaping it. You might as well just consider me swallowed by the waves already. You deserve someone better.
Sisi: Don't talk like that Chaoxi. I know that you'll be just fine...
