Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

Arasudraka: Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) is preparing for Festival Utsava. This festival will become a warm song for sure.
 About Festival Utsava...
Arasudraka: Arasudraka wants to sing with Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) right now.
Arasudraka: But Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) still needs to prepare for Festival Utsava with Arama.
Arasudraka: If you feel tired, come listen to the Song Gatherers' song.
 About Aramaha...
Arasudraka: Thank you, Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), for letting me hear the song of Aramaha.
Arasudraka: I am getting closer to the Sourcesong, the homeland of songs.

Dialogue Set #2[]

Arasudraka: Golden Nara has to leave. Not happy. But more songs will be created, and the Sourcesong will be closer.
 About the Sourcesong...
Arasudraka: The song that Golden Nara and Aranara sang at Festival Utsava is the brightest, most satisfying song I've ever heard, like the most plump pomegranate.
Arasudraka: Perhaps this is the melody that is closest to the Sourcesong.
Arasudraka: I think the longer Golden Nara's journey, the closer the Sourcesong will be.
 Goodbye.
Arasudraka: Goodbye, Golden Nara. I hope our songs will always be with you.
