Brandt was once the butler of the duelist Rocky Avildsen, but stole everything from him, causing Avildsen to exile himself into Erinnyes Forest.[1] Brandt was also a jeweler, and used underhanded methods to destroy Athos's business and life, which Athos retaliated against by stabbing him to death and dumping his corpse in the Salacia Plain. Athos has spent his life in hiding ever since.[2]
Athos alludes to his murder of Brandt while confronting the Traveler for investigating Benoit Leroy's home.[3]
