Kitain Bunsou (Japanese: 喜多院文宗 Kitain Bunsou), also known as Kitain the Serpent, was a historical figure in Inazuma best known as one of Inazuma's great martial artists. He was one of the Yashiori Island Guardians charged with subduing the Tatarigami that emerged after Orobashi's death.[1]
Kitain forged the Kitain Cross Spear to suit his unique spearmanship style. He is likely the creator of the Kitain School, a martial arts style that is still practiced in Inazuma to this day.[2]

Profile[]
Little is known about Kitain besides his accomplishments in hunting Tatarigami. He had a line of descendants, but the family died out for reasons unknown in legend.[3] It is possible that the family perished due to Kitain Hideie's escape during the cataclysm.[4]

Trivia[]
He is most likely inspired by Houzouin In'ei (1521–1607), a Japanese warrior monk who invented cross spears and founded the Houzouin school, which specializes in the art of spearmanship.
Kitain is the name of a Buddhist temple in Japan patronized by the shoguns of the Tokugawa Shogunate. It may be also an allusion to Houzouin, since both literally mean the abundance of blissfulness: "Temple Where There Are Many Joys (Muditā in Sanskrit and Pali)" (Japanese: 喜多院 Kitain) and "Temple of Treasury (Holy Scriptures)" (Japanese: 宝蔵院 Houzouin).
