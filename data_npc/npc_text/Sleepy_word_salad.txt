Dialogue[]

Sleepy: Hold on a second, I don't know you... Why would you come up and start making conversation with me? It's bad manners!
 ...Is it?
Sleepy: Can't you see I'm at my post? If you want to make conversation, you should tell me first!
 Doesn't telling you count as part of the conversation?
Sleepy: If that were the case, you should at least know to give me a heads up before telling me you want to make conversation... Honestly...
 Sorry for inconveniencing you.
Sleepy: Apology accepted! I appreciate it! Have a wonderful day!
