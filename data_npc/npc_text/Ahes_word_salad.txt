 One day...
Media:VO Ahes 01.ogg One day... I will be just like Captain Basil.

Dialogue[]

Ahes: Hello there! I'm presently reading the sailing logs. Captain Basil really is impressive — I've learned so much just from reading the logs she left.
Ahes: Even though the Sponsian's been... But I'm more than satisfied with having been able to witness her past from these records!
 How've things been going lately?
Ahes: I've been sorting through Captain Basil's navigation maps. It's been tough going, but it's also been really fun!
Ahes: I've learned about many lost ports through reading other stories in the past, and I've been able to approximate their locations through her records and the clues she left.
Ahes: Still, there are some things I don't quite understand...
 Things you don't quite understand?
Ahes: That's right. Some of her logs constantly mention this place called the Narzissenkreuz Institute, and she often talks about "the children there"...
Ahes: I think that must've been some sort of school with lots of kids. If I had more corroborating evidence, I could prove this hypothesis of mine.
 I hope your restoration work goes smoothly!
Ahes: Yup. I searched for the Sponsian for so, so long...
Ahes: And thanks to your help, I managed to find these logs and maps!
Ahes: The restoration's slow going, but I believe that as long as I persist, I'll finish it someday!
 That's good...
Ahes: Yup. Maybe someday, I'll have my own ship, and I can sail the seas just like she did.
