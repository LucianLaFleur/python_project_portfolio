Dialogue[]

Zhonglin: Hi there! No, that seat's not taken. Please, feel free to sit with me.
 Who are you?
Zhonglin: My name is Zhonglin. I'm a traveling merchant from... Hmm, am I from Qingce Village or from the city? I don't know which one counts as home!
 Tell me about your business.
Zhonglin: My business? I'm just a small-time vendor. I pick up the few little bits of business that slip through the hands of those Liyue tycoons, the Qixing.
Zhonglin: As a traveling merchant, you can't possibly make good money from selling general goods you'd find in a store. You have to focus on more niche items.
Zhonglin: These mushrooms are from Sumeru, for example. I'll bet you've never seen them before.
 Is there something special about mushrooms from Sumeru?
Zhonglin: Oh... I'm not really the right person to ask. I'm no expert in plants.
Zhonglin: They don't look much different on the outside... Maybe they have a unique taste or something?
Zhonglin: How about this: You take this one back with you and put it in your next dish. If the dish turns out well, put in a good word for me with all your acquaintances! Hahaha...
(Obtain  Mushroom ×6)
 Tell me about your home.
Zhonglin: My wife lives in the city, while my daughter lives with her grandparents — my parents — in Mt. Qingce.
Zhonglin: So what does that make me? Good question. I'm not sure I have a good answer.
Zhonglin: Speaking of origins... Where do you come from?
 Goodbye.
Zhonglin: Goodbye. I hope next time we meet you'll become a customer!

Trivia[]
Zhonglin leaves a message on the Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board, advertising his goods. A reply to his posting indicates that someone from Qingce Village has passed through the area.
