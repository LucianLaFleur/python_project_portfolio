Appearance[]
Sugiyama wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the ashigaru (Japanese: 足軽) of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient shitagi with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray kobakama, and waraji sandals without the socks. Although not visible, the Sangonomiya Clan's crest is imprinted on the back of the shitagi, below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with sode (shoulder armor), han-kote (half-armored sleeves), haidate (thigh guards), and sune-ate (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it. Sugiyama is equipped with a juumonji yari, whose shaft is colored with a red-white gradient and has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest under the spearhead.

 Where's my replacement?
Media:VO Sugiyama 01.ogg "My shift should be over by now. Where's my replacement?"

Dialogue[]

Sugiyama: Why hasn't it arrived yet? I'm starving over here...
 Waiting for someone?
Sugiyama: You bet! The guard who was supposed to take over from me should have arrived ages ago.
Sugiyama: But for some reason, I don't see anyone coming along. Did he meet with some trouble along the way?
Sugiyama: I should probably check on him... But the path here is treacherously steep, and if I leave, no one's going to be watching it... Ugh, what do I do...
 This place is pretty high up, yes.
Sugiyama: I know, right? Someone needs to stand guard here at all times to advise people to watch their step — and so that no one will fall down unseen.
Sugiyama: This is one of the paths to Sangonomiya Shrine, after all, so no small number of shrine maidens, soldiers, and residents pass this way.
Sugiyama: ...Whatever the case, I just hope that the person taking over the shift gets here soon. I need to eat real bad...
 See you around.
Sugiyama: See you. I guess I'll wait a while longer...
