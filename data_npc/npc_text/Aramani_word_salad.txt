Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]
Available before completing Festival Utsava.


Aramani: "Fine goods" for sale! Come take a look! "Great stuff at reasonable prices," "Buy now before they're all sold out!"
 I'll have some Aranara specialties.
Aramani: "Specialties"? I don't understand... But there are "fine goods."

 Aranara... merchant?
Aramani: Huh... Why does Nara friend's expression look so strange?
Aramani: Don't Nara merchants speak like this...?
Aramani: Or is "Buy now before they're all sold out!" not available here?
Aramani: I don't understand. Nara merchants' talk, too strange.
 Goodbye.
Aramani: Goodbye, Nara friend. "We look forward to seeing you again"?

Dialogue Set #2[]
Available after starting Festival Utsava and until completing "Hello," "Thank You," and the Final "Goodbye." 


Aramani: Festival! Fun! Many "customers," many "sales"! "Don't miss out on a good sale!"
 What's for sale?
Aramani: The big "sale" now is happiness from Festival Utsava! Nara friend, would you like some happiness?
 What is happiness?
Aramani: Happiness cannot be seen or touched, but fills the Vanarana during Festival Utsava... I understand. Happiness is brought by Nara friend!
 Goodbye.
Aramani: Goodbye, Nara friend. I hope you have lots of happiness and lots of "sales"!

Dialogue Set #3[]
Available after completing "Hello," "Thank You," and the Final "Goodbye." 


Aramani: I made "a fortune" during Festival Utsava, and I want to have more happiness, so the next step is...
 I'll have some fine goods.
Aramani: It's not called "fine goods" anymore. Aramani is now selling "specialties."
(Opens the Shop menu)
 Goodbye.
Aramani: Goodbye, Nara friend. I hope you'll make "a fortune" too.
