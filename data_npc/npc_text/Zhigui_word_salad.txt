 Liaison work...

Dialogue[]

Zhigui: The work is getting more and more complicated, so we'll need to take extra caution when handling affairs...
Zhigui: Hmm? Hello there, welcome!
 What do you do here?
Zhigui: Thanks for asking! To put it simply, I'm responsible for liaison work between the Communications Office's Hezhe Post and the Millelith, the teahouses, the Secure Transport Agency, and other organizations.
Zhigui: If the leader of a group of guards for hire has guards waiting to be dispatched, I'll go get an order from Hezhe Post.
Zhigui: If the teahouse sends someone here to confirm a tea delivery order on its behalf, I'll direct them to talk to the appropriate harbor staff to discuss the details.
Zhigui: If a merchant wants make a large shipment to a foreign port and needs to have his goods inspected and registered first, I'll connect them to a specialist at Hezhe Post...
 It sounds like you've got a lot to do...
Zhigui: It can't be helped. After all, Yilong Wharf is a busy port with people coming and going all the time. Without someone in charge of coordinating all this activity, everything becomes a big mess in a big hurry.
Zhigui: Sometimes, I don't even have time to enjoy a nice pot of tea with Gaming when he comes back... He's also always busy as a bee, heh.
Zhigui: Good thing Gaming has made so many friends here, so he doesn't need the likes of me worrying about him.
 I'll leave you to it then, bye.
Zhigui: It was my pleasure. See you next time!
