Dialogue[]

Maksim: Ah, the Pearl Galley truly is as wonderful as they say. The men are striking, and the women exquisite...
Maksim: A mere look has made this trip worth it!
 What's this place?
Maksim: Oh, this is the greatest place in all of Liyue.
Maksim: Ah, a venue like this would be an impossibility in the bitter cold of Snezhnaya.
Maksim: Ahem... Although I originally intended to do business here in Liyue, I must say that I have forgotten all such thoughts already...
Maksim: Even if Lady Ningguang herself were to summon me to the Jade Chamber to talk business, I may not go.
 Goodbye.
Maksim: Come now, don't be shy. Sit and have a drink! I know one of the musicians here, truly top-class...

Trivia[]
One of the possible names for the Fatui Pyro Agent fought during "Emergency" is Maksim. However, it is unlikely that the agent is the same person as the NPC.
