Profile[]
Mitsunaga was an apprentice of the Isshin Art alongside Kaedehara Kagemitsu and Niwa Nagamitsu when Futsu Masayoshi, the bladesmith of Haran Geppaku Futsu, approached them. Having left the Futsu school to avoid a succession crisis between himself and the fourth-generation master Futsu Hiroyoshi, Masayoshi left to travel around and learn the techniques of other forging practices. The three apprenticed under Masayoshi and went on to create each piece in the Isshin Sansaku.[1]

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
The names Kagemitsu (Japanese: 景光), Nagamitsu (Japanese: 長光), and Sanenaga (Japanese: 実長) (rendered in the English localization as Mitsunaga) are derived from the three disciples of Mitsutada (Japanese: 光忠), the founder of the Osafune School. The three disciples were known as the "Three Great Masters" (Japanese: 三作 sansaku) of the Osafune School.[2]
