  Mentioned CharactersAranara 




Aradasha is a historical figure of the Aranara, who repaired the Varuna Contraption alongside Aramuhukunda and Nara Varuna. Aradasha was regarded as the strongest Ararakalari user, second only to the Aranara's creator Queen Aranyani.[1] It is mentioned as the Aranara who defeated and sealed eighteen big metal monsters, and disappeared afterward.[1]
Aradasha's legacy is the focus of the World Quest Legends of the Stone Lock, when the Traveler unsealed and destroyed sixteen sealed Ruin Machines, and then defeated a sealed Perpetual Mechanical Array with the help of Aradashan, Arayuta, Arasata, and Arasaha. It is unclear what the eighteenth Ruin Machine that Aradasha sealed was. A possible candidate is the Ruin Golem in Devantaka Mountain.[2]
