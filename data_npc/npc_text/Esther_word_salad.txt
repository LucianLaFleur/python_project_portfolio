Dialogue[]

Esther: I never thought that I would see such a sight in Mondstadt...
 What are you mumbling about?
Esther: Oh, hello. I'm an environmentalist and researcher of geography. I'm currently investigating the terrain here.
Esther: To find a snow-capped mountain right here in Mondstadt, given the climate in the rest of the region, is really quite fascinating.
Esther: I've seen similar circumstances elsewhere in the past, such as the Chasm in Liyue, so there may be some similarities in their respective terrain features...
Esther: I wanted to go up the mountain to do some proper research, but I was stopped by that Knight of Favonius. A real spoilsport, that one.
 Tell me about this mountain...
Esther: Oh, interested in Dragonspine, are you? Interesting. You might have some potential as a geographer...
Esther: I became a researcher out of curiosity concerning the source of Springvale's spring water — that source turned out to be the melting snow of Dragonspine.
Esther: In order to study Dragonspine's environment more deeply, I prepared some Frostshield Potions, but it turns out the cold here is so intense that even potions are useless against it...
Esther: They serve no purpose with me, so I reckon that you should take them. They won't be enough to resist the cold here on Dragonspine, but they might be of use in your future adventures.
(Obtain  Frostshield Potion ×4)
 See you around.
Esther: Alright, take care now.
