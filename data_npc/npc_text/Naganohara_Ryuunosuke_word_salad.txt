Naganohara Ryuunosuke's locationAdditional context
Profile[]
Naganohara Ryuunosuke is the father of Yoimiya and previous owner of Naganohara Fireworks. Due to his work with explosions, he is hard of hearing, and in-game he is referred to as deaf.
When Yoimiya obtained her Vision, she did not think much of it at the time and tossed it away in a storeroom, forgetting about it. Ryuunosuke found the Vision sometime later and realized the value of it, bringing it back to his daughter and telling her to take care of it.[2]
Despite having stepped down as owner, he claims that he is still an expert firework-maker.

Dialogue[]

(Before completing The Firework Girl's Strange Stories)

Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Wow, where did you come from, youngster? You're looking quite snazzy!
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Are you here to buy fireworks? If you came to this place, it means that you know where the real deal is, hahaha!
(After completing The Firework Girl's Strange Stories)

Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh, if it isn't my little girl's new pal? You here to hang out with her again?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Make sure you go check out the fireworks if you have the chance, hahaha!
 Can I ask about those fireworks?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Ahaha, well, I'm no longer the owner of Naganohara Fireworks.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: I'm far too old. My ears aren't as sharp as they were before, so I left the shop to my daughter.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: However, even if I no longer run the shop anymore, I am still very confident in my ability to make fireworks! The fireworks from my shop are guaranteed to be the best. Everyone from Inazuma knows about the Naganohara Fireworks Show.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: The other shops can't even hope to match the fireworks I've made in terms of styles and variety. Hahaha!
 How many kinds of fireworks are there here?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: If you're asking about fireworks, it's a long story from a long time ago...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Transportation wasn't very convenient back then, so people on different islands found it hard to communicate with each other.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: One day, people suddenly discovered the various uses of fire. Apart from keeping warm, the smoke fire creates can also be seen from far away...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Much later on... people invented fireworks, hahaha.
 You seem to have skipped a fair bit of that story...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: The colors, shapes, and firing intervals of fireworks all have different meanings. Inazumans in the past used this method to communicate with each other from somewhere far away.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: It takes a lot of skill and knowledge to manufacture fireworks. Using powder from different ores will result in different colors.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: I'm the best at tuning the color of these fireworks. I can make any color that you pick, even black or white!
 The Naganohara Fireworks Show?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh, you mean my daughter? That girl can pick up anything very quickly. But she can be pretty reckless too. She's gotten herself in trouble a lot.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: She was once invited by the Yashiro Commission to host a ceremony, but she accidentally started a very big fire. The fire brigade was very angry...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: The fire brigade wanted to ban fireworks at the ceremony at that time. But how could we let that happen? The Fireworks Show is an essential part of life in Inazuma, after all. Banning fireworks would be like making Onigiri without rice or ramen without noodles.
 Fire brigade?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Ah, what did you say again? My ears aren't that good... Oh, you mean the Naganohara Fireworks Show, right?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: We can't talk about Fireworks Show without mentioning fireworks. A long time ago...
 Goodbye.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Leaving already? The Fireworks Show is this way, you know? Don't get lost now.

Event Dialogue[]
Hues of the Violet Garden[]

Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh my, if isn't my little girl's pal? You here to hang out with her again?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: I've heard that the two of you brought a new friend along. Heard that it's some cute little red kid, too. Make sure you two give her the tour, eh?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: And once the festival ban on pyrotechnics comes down, get Yoimiya to make her a special custom firework, haha!

Paimon can see how that might've worn down his ears...Paimon: Yikes! Since Yoimiya is inheriting her family business, does that mean she'll have trouble hearing other people in the future, just like her dad?Paimon: Paimon won't let that happen! Let's think of some way to help her!(Traveler): Do you have any suggestions, Paimon?Paimon: Uh... Um...Paimon: Paimon could follow Yoimiya around and cover her ears whenever needed...(Traveler): Then you'd need to leave me.Paimon: ...Without Paimon, you'd lose your guide. Paimon wouldn't leave you like that!Paimon: But... What should we do for Yoimiya...(Traveler): Actually, she can simply wear earplugs while working with fireworks.Paimon: Oh yeah! Paimon didn't think of that solution! You're so smart!(Traveler): Heh... That was the first thing that came to my mind, but I wanted to give you an opportunity for a mental workout.Paimon: Eh?

When I was young, he would always smile no matter what I said to him, and so I thought that everything I said was correct. So I kept talking, and he would keep smiling. Later, I found out that he was smiling because he couldn't hear clearly, but... as long as he's truly happy, I'll keep talking to him.About the Vision Media:VO_Yoimiya About the Vision.ogg Media:VO ZH_Yoimiya About the Vision.ogg Media:VO JA_Yoimiya About the Vision.ogg Media:VO KO_Yoimiya About the Vision.ogg Let me let you in on a little secret. When I first received my Vision, I used it as a flint to light fireworks and boil water, before returning home, chucking it into a storeroom, and forgetting all about it. In the end, it was my father who found it and told me that it was a precious item that I should keep safe. Haha, at least it didn't get taken back by our dear Archon.Something to Share: Cycles Media:VO_Yoimiya Something to Share - Cycles.ogg Media:VO ZH_Yoimiya Something to Share - Cycles.ogg Media:VO JA_Yoimiya Something to Share - Cycles.ogg Media:VO KO_Yoimiya Something to Share - Cycles.ogg "When the last sparks of the fireworks have disappeared into the sky, they turn into rain and snow, and will fall upon the earth again, nourishing the land and nurturing humanity, so that someday they can be sent up into the sky again and display their magnificence." Of the many stories my father told me, this one is my favorite.
