Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Jabari: Answer this question real quick, would you? Fish, or meat?
 I'll take them all.
Jabari: ...Well, that was quick.
Jabari: But unfortunately, I'm afraid that only one meat dish is permitted at a time at my family's table.
Jabari: Otherwise, my wife will talk my ear off about "earnings" and "saving Mora" all night, starting at the dinner table.
 Wait. Fish don't count as meat?
Jabari: ...Well, that's an unexpected reply!
Jabari: Does fish count as meat? Hmm. I suppose each person might have a different answer in mind...
Jabari: But that's not the problem here. I'm just wondering what I should have for dinner.
Jabari: Speaking of which, are you hungry? Would you like to have a little something?
Jabari: I don't mean to brag, but I do make some excellent food. Drop by if you've got the time and try some!
 I'm alright, but my companion might be hungry.
Jabari: Ah yes, I can see how that might become a problem.
Jabari: The troubles of a teammate by your side can be even harder to handle than your own.
Jabari: Whatever the case, why don't you try some?
(Obtain  Delicious Aaru Mixed Rice ×3)
 Either?
Jabari: Hmm... Well, that's not a useful reply, but fair enough, I'll give it some more thought.

Nighttime[]

Sania: Hmmm. It seems that this is all the Mora I have at the moment...
Sania: Ugh. How am I supposed to live like this?
Jabari: Hey, hey. Relax. Relax...
Jabari: Come on now. I've done some handiwork recently and got plenty of food in return, didn't I?
Sania: And so what? You want us to go on living from hand to mouth like this? What are we going to do when those menial jobs stop making us Mora?
Sania: I'm not going to just watch that happen, unlike you!
Sania: *sigh* Sometimes I wonder if I'm the only one in this family who actually worries about our future here...
