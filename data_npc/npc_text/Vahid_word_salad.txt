 Lesser Lord Kusanali's kindness...
Media:VO Vahid 01.ogg "Enjoy the blessing of Lesser Lord Kusanali! Anahitian Blessing now 10% off!"

Dialogue[]

Vahid: Oh! Dear customer, are you also interested in Anahitian Blessing?
 Anahitian Blessing?
Vahid: Have you never heard of it?
Vahid: It's a specialty from our Sumeru, the grace of Lesser Lord Kusanali!
Vahid: No matter how barren the land or dreadful the climate, a small amount of it shall work wonders!
 What is the theory behind that product?
Vahid: Um, well... It must be the elemental power within, which grants the land more vitality, and then that, uh...
Vahid: *cough* I'm not a researcher, so I can't really explain it well. Anyway, we the Sumeru locals all use this stuff for farming. Its effects are impeccable.
Vahid: It's perfect either for your own use or as a gift for your family and friends!
 About this shop...
Vahid: Syavushi Bakshesh Shoppe only sells specialties from Sumeru.
Vahid: Apart from our featured product, Anahitian Blessing, we also have the carefully picked Super Delicious Rukkhashava Mushrooms...
Vahid: These specialties all came from Sumeru across the sea. So rest assured, their authenticity is guaranteed!
 How's business going?
(Before completing Transient Dreams)
Vahid: Why would you ask that? Of course...
Vahid: ...Ah never mind, I'll be honest with you.
Vahid: Before the Sakoku Decree, we still had Inazuma locals coming from Narukami Island to purchase our goods.
Vahid: But ever since the Sakoku Decree took effect, only a few people have come. It's getting harder to do business, and I'm not sure how long can we last...
Vahid: Dear customer, would you like to buy some Anahitian Blessing? How about buying it as a souvenir for your journey here?
 How's business been?
(After completing Transient Dreams)
Vahid: Uh... How should I put this?
Vahid: I originally thought that the Sakoku Decree's abolishing would see business pick up, but it hasn't actually improved all that much.
Vahid: It's always the same few customers coming to purchase fertilizers. They often forget the method of using the fertilizer to boot...
Vahid: Well, by the way, dear customer, would you like some Anahitian Blessing? How about buying it as a souvenir for your journey here?
 Eh, no thanks.
Vahid: Ha, haha...
Vahid: Ah, indeed, who would buy fertilizers as a souvenir...
 Thank you! Goodbye!
Vahid: Ah, okay. We look forward to your next visit.
