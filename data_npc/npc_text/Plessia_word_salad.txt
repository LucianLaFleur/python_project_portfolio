 The deployment of Gardes...
Media:VO Plessia 01.ogg "I have to keep an eye on the deployment of Gardes at all times."

Dialogue[]

Plessia: Greetings. I handle all manner of affairs regarding Fontaine's security.
 About security...
Plessia: The Gardemeks are in charge of daily security matters, and they aid their corresponding Gardes officers in conducting patrols.
Plessia: Machines are not omnipotent, after all. There are many things that can only be accomplished by humans.
Plessia: Gardemeks and the Gardes are both under the Maison Gardiennage.
Plessia: If something arises that they, too, cannot handle, then it shall be up to the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, or the Chief Justice's personal unit, the Marechaussee Phantom.
 Tell me about the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol...
Plessia: They are the elite of the Maison Gardiennage.
Plessia: They handle affairs that ordinary Gardes would struggle with — such as criminals who refuse to negotiate and attempt to resist violently.
Plessia: Normally, criminals who still maintain a spark of rationality would surrender upon encountering the Patrol.
 As for the Marechaussee Phantom...
Plessia: That organization was once comprised only of humans, but now the majority of them are Melusines.
Plessia: They were added in when the Chief Justice noticed that their special visual acuity was most suited to investigating cases.
Plessia: I apologize if I get a little excited at times. Please understand.
Plessia: After all, the lovely Melusines are treasured companions of us Fontainians.
 You must really like Melusines.
Plessia: Yes, and I never conceal my love for them.
Plessia: As a cardinal defense officer that handles city defense affairs, I am obliged to emphasize that—
Plessia: Though Melusines are tiny, adorable beings, they are Fontainian citizens, not pets or monsters.
Plessia: I will not allow any inappropriate thoughts regarding Melusines.
(Obtain  Guide to Order)
 I shan't bother you, then.
Plessia: See you, in that case.
