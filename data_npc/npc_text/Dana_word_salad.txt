Dialogue[]

Dana: Days feel like years while I wait for this...
 What are you waiting for?
Dana: An outcome that will decide my future!
Dana: ...It's my application to remain in school after graduation.
Dana: I heard the competition to join the Akademiya has been growing in intensity. People are giving recommendations to Ms. Kemia every day. I wonder if I still have a chance...
Dana: No, I must stay confident. Based on the results of my final paper, I still have quite the advantage.
 Tell me about your results...
Dana: It was on Padisarah.
Dana: Do you know that there are very few plantations of Padisarah due to its harsh requirements for the environment?
Dana: If it's possible to develop a stabler variety, then it'll be able to greatly improve the efficiency of growing Padisarah.
Dana: I proposed quite an effective solution in my graduation paper. If I can stay in school and continue my research after graduation, I'm certain that I'll be able to make a bigger breakthrough.
 Sounds like a plan.
Dana: Hearing you say this, I feel a bit more relieved.
Dana: Anyway, I've done the best I could, now it's all up to destiny.
Dana: By the way, these are the Padisarah I cultivated during my research.
Dana: Smells amazing, right? Please take them as a gift. I just hope all our wishes will come true.
(Obtain  Padisarah ×4)
 See you.
