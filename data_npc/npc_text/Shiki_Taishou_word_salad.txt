Profile[]
Shiki Taishou is a shikigami created by the onmyouji Kamuna Harunosuke, and is tasked with overseeing the mysterious Domain known as the Mystic Onmyou Chamber.

Appearance[]
Being a shikigami, Shiki Taishou is a small, thin paper figure that is imbued with magical power. His appearance is modeled after a samurai in navy blue armor with gold accents and a maroon "belt." Making up his face are two rosy spots for cheeks, and a pair of dynamic Inazuman glyphs for eyes with which he uses to emote. His eyes usually appear as two "L's," but can change to represent different expressions, such as "I's" which represent a saddened expression. Another glyph, the Inazuman letter "A," is marked on his back flaps.

Story[]
Shiki Taishou and his many replicas were created during the time of the cataclysm, with the sole purpose of protecting Inazuma from the "great evil" that plagued its soil. Each of the shikigami were assigned to a samurai, and combined their magic and martial strengths to take on the monsters in pairs. As they defeated monsters, information on them was recorded by the shikigami; which would then be channeled into the Mystic Onmyou Chamber to create "mirror monsters" as training targets for the samurai. By absorbing the knowledge and experiences of the replicas, Shiki Taishou was able to improve the training for the samurai and the structure of the Domain.[2]
Many samurai were wounded, and a great number of shikigami were lost in the war. Despite their valiant efforts, they were greatly overshadowed by the Shogun's Army; who had already regained control of the situation. Shiki Taishou, though disheartened by this, convinces Harunosuke to move on and start anew. Harunosuke departs from the Domain with Shiki Taishou inside it, where the shikigami fell into a deep slumber while awaiting his master's return.[2]
In the present day, the Mystic Onmyou Chamber is suddenly reawakened by an unknown power; causing the mirror monsters within to escape into the outside world. Shiki Taishou attempts to stop them, but is overwhelmed and falls unconscious beside the gate.
He is then woken up by the Traveler, Paimon and Xinyan, who came to the Araumi region to investigate the Domain at Kujou Sara's request. Shiki Taishou finds that much of his memory has been lost, along with his ability to control the Domain; which Paimon suggests might be recovered if he returns to the Domain. Meanwhile, Xinyan and the Traveler have doubts about whether he can be trusted. Xinyan decides to test his sincerity by playing him a piece of rock 'n' roll music, and seeing how it made him feel. Shiki Taishou feels uplifted by this melody (and takes a liking to the genre as a whole[2]); and relays a particularly vivid experience in which he was wandering alone, then joins some people having Grilled Fish over a fire. His response earns Xinyan's trust, and the group agrees to help him regain his memories in the Domain.[3]
Upon entering the Mystic Onmyou Chamber, Shiki Taishou and his new allies run into Tartaglia; who joins their party despite the Traveler's reservations.[3] Tartaglia later reveals he is investigating the Domain for any possible connections to his fellow Harbinger Scaramouche, who had recently gone missing after coming into possession of the Electro Archon's Gnosis.[2]
As the group venture deeper into the ever-changing Chamber, Shiki Taishou gradually regains more and more of his memories by fusing with his fallen replicas. Eventually, he comes to realize why he was created all those years ago, and has now regained full control of the Domain; he hopes to return it to its original state, and to seal the mirror monsters inside for good. Having found his purpose, he feels upset that he has to part ways with his allies; Xinyan reassures him that she will pay him visits regularly. As a gift to the Traveler, he creates a new replica of himself — Shiki Koshou — using his own power and explains that he can hear and see whatever Koshou sees so that he could "travel" with them.
Later, Shiki Taishou explains the situation to the Tenryou Commission, and clears himself and the Mystic Onmyou Chamber of suspicion. He has also fully restored the Domain to its original state, and invites the Traveler to step into it one last time.[4]

Trivia[]
In Japanese folklore, shikigami (Japanese: 式神 "ceremonial spirit") are spirits conjured in rituals by their masters, onmyouji, to serve various purposes. Some shikigami may be used as protective charms, tools of divination, or as messengers and spies; while others may be employed for more sinister deeds such as curses. They can come in many forms, but they commonly appear as being bound to small human-shaped paper figures and other objects.
