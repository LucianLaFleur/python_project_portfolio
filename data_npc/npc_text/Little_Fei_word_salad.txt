Dialogue[]

(Before completing Ahoy! A Pirate's Growth for Ye!)
Little Lulu: Ten thousand waves, it's time to set sail!
Little Meng: Arrr! The waves be gettin' bigger! Whoa! My booty and plunder is goin' to go overboard! Strap 'er down, maties!
Little Lulu: Matey! Matey! All hands on deck! Or else... or else I'll... I'll make ye walk the plank!
Little Fei: ...
Little Lulu: Matey!
Little Fei: ...I don't wanna play anymore. I'm always your "matey..."
Little Lulu: So what do you wanna be?
Little Fei: ...I wanna be Captain Beidou...
Little Fei: Captain Beidou's so cool, but it's always Lulu that gets to be her!
Little Lulu: That's 'cause I'm a girl and I'm the oldest!
Little Fei: But, but I'm the tallest! Boy, girl, it's all the same when you close your eyes anyway!
Little Meng: It's not the same! You don't have the same... feeling!
Little Fei: *cries*
Little Meng: Oh, now you've done it! Fei is crying again...
Little Lulu: Okay, okay... I'll let you have a turn being Beidou, okay?
(After completing Ahoy! A Pirate's Growth for Ye!)
Little Fei: Why has Little Meng decided to go to Sumeru?
Little Lulu: Maybe he just wants to have a look around.
Little Fei: Really? That's so cool... I wanna go out and play as well...
