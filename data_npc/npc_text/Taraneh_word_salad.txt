Dialogue[]

Taraneh: Hello! How are you today?
 Adventure Challenge
(Opens Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
(If the player loses the match)

Taraneh: Hehe, it seems that you need to be more careful.
(If the player wins the match)

Taraneh: H- How [sic] did... No. I have to rethink my deck composition.
 Meh.
Taraneh: There's something going on, isn't there?
Taraneh: So it isn't just me... Everyone has their bad days...
Taraneh: But it's okay! That's just life — sometimes we get hurt, and sometimes we get to sing happy songs.
Taraneh: A heartless sailor from foreign lands once broke my heart. But look at me now, I can still dance!
Taraneh: Ah, I forgot to mention that I am a street performer. Come see me dance if you're in a bad mood!
 I can teach him a lesson for you.
Taraneh: I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid I'll have to pass.
Taraneh: Not that I don't trust your abilities, I just want to do it myself!
Taraneh: Once I save enough money from my performances, I'll hire the best Eremite mercenary to teach me the most powerful fighting skills.
Taraneh: Then I can take a ship to Liyue and smack that cheater hard on the face!
(Obtain  Teachings of Praxis ×3)
 Pretty good!
Taraneh: That's great! I'm happy for you!
Taraneh: Bad luck is only temporary but good luck is forever! Waltz through whatever comes your way, will you?

Trivia[]
Taraneh's dialogue could possibly be about Chaoxi, who is a sailor from Liyue that notoriously cheats on Cui'er and Sisi.
