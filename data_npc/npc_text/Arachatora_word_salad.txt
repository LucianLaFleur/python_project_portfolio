Dialogue[]
Dialogue Set #1[]

(Available during An Unwavering Culinary Dream)
Arachatora: I'm so happy that I was able to gather the Head Mushroom, complete my cooking training, and get to know a strong and reliable Nara.
Arachatora: Arapacati, Arasaka, Arapas, and Araphala will be grateful too. Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), you're a good Nara.
 Grateful? Why?
Arachatora: Because by helping me, you've given them a chance to taste the Head Mushroom.

Dialogue Set #2[]

(Available after An Unwavering Culinary Dream)
Arachatora: Sister is angry, so Arachatora is keeping a piece of "Head Mushroom," till the Sunsettia ripens ten times.
 Keeping a piece?
Arachatora: Cooking all the "Head Mushroom" for Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler), that was the plan. But sister said, no mushroom picking before the Sunsettia ripens another ten times.
Arachatora: Without the scent of mushrooms, Arachatora feels bad. Arachatora might sneak out for mushrooms when the Sunsettia ripens only nine times.
Arachatora: So Arachatora kept a tiny little piece, thinner than the leaves. It will stay with Arachatora.
Arachatora: So embarrassing...
 That's a long wait...
Arachatora: *whimper*
Arachatora: But at that time, maybe "Head Mushroom" in Vana, could grow bigger, and have richer taste.
Arachatora: Perhaps... They'll grow into "Super Triple Head Mushroom."
Arachatora: Thinking about that, makes Arachatora a little happier.
 Goodbye.
Arachatora: *whimper*

Dialogue Set #3[]

(Available after "Hello," "Thank You," and the Final "Goodbye")
Arachatora: At Festival Utsava, everyone is happy, Arachatora is even happier. When the Sunsettias ripen once more, I can go to find new mushrooms.
 Once more?
Arachatora: Yes! Arapacati said the "Head Mushroom" brought happiness to Nara.
Arachatora: That's why she's not angry anymore and I don't have to wait until the Sunsettias to ripen many times to pick mushrooms.
Arachatora: I must find mushrooms with better flavors. I hope this time Arapacati won't be angry, or Arapacati will definitely have me wait until the Sunsettias have ripened 100 times, or even 100 times of 100 times.
 New mushrooms?
Arachatora: It's said that, somewhere far, far away, there are mushrooms that have the color of fallen leaves and grow on the feet of pine trees.
Arachatora: There's another kind of mushrooms. They are as blue as the sky. They glitter at moonrise.
Arachatora: That mushroom and the "Head Mushroom," which tastes better?
Arachatora: For this "special cooking training," I want to find those mushrooms, and use them to cook the supreme delicacy for Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler).
 Good luck!
Arachatora: I will find mushrooms with richer flavors! Nara (TravelerTravelerThe player's chosen name for the Traveler) must come and enjoy the food together by then!
