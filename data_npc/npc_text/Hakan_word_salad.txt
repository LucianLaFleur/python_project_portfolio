Dialogue[]
Daytime[]

Hakan: What can I do for you?
Hakan: Sorry, I was dozing off and didn't notice you.
 Are you that tired?
Hakan: Not so much tired as bored.
Hakan: Don't you think it's easier to fall sleep in noisy places like a theater or market?
Hakan: There's no one from the Akademiya around the theater, anyway, so I'm not under watch.
Hakan: When Azra isn't asking me to run after Swoof, and no students insist on taking pictures with Nilou, dozing off is all I've got left.
 Excuse me.
Hakan: See you.

Nighttime[]

Hakan: Ah! If it isn't Lemta! The last time I saw you in the city... Um... Well, I believe I've never seen you in the city before.
Lemta: Yeah. I came this time with an adventurer who paid me to protect her.
Lemta: My original plan was to leave after we've registered at the Adventurers' Guild, but she became obsessed with shopping halfway...
Lemta: I've spent days with her in the Grand Bazaar... And I have a feeling that this isn't gonna end soon.
Hakan: Wow, you're not exaggerating, are you?
Lemta: Nope. I guess it has to do with her being a foreigner, so anything here could pique her interest easily. Every day, she shops until the sun sets. And as her bodyguard, I can't leave her alone.
Hakan: Wow, that sounds terrible. You've never been a fan of the fancy stuff at the market. I guess you must be so bored right now.
Hakan: Why don't you quit the job and join the Corps of Thirty?
Hakan: We only work for the Akademiya. It's a stable job with much to earn and not so much to be done. This is far better than taking gigs in small gangs.
Lemta: I'll pass. The fact that even you are saying there's "not much to be done" means only one thing: What the job involves is eating, drinking, sleeping, and nothing more.
Hakan: Haha! You sure know me very well.
