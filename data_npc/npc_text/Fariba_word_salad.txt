Dialogue[]

Fariba: Welcome.
 What are you selling?
Fariba: Well... I'm not familiar with every single product. Everything's displayed in the store for customers to check themselves.
Fariba: And there are some daily necessities here...
Fariba: Blankets, spatulas, umbrellas, glasses, stuff like that...
 How much is an umbrella?
Fariba: Huh? There's no price tag on it?
Fariba: Hmm, umbrella, umbrella...
Fariba: *sigh* I can't remember the price.
Fariba: Why don't you look for something else?
 ...Are you able to make any sales like that?
Fariba: I seem to be doing... okay? I don't keep the books, so I'm not quite sure about this.
Fariba: A few customers come to our shop every day, but none of them are regular.
Fariba: A little girl often comes to the manager for business. That's the only familiar face I can remember.
Fariba: But I don't know what goods she delivers...
Fariba: The manager seems to be very respectful to her, but never displays what she's delivered to the store.
 See you.
Fariba: Take care.
