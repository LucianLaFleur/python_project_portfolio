Liliane is a thief from Mondstadt who eventually came to Fontaine. She was first spotted stealing from Lectoure in the Romaritime Harbor by Lyney during Archon Quest Soloist's Prologue in Chapter IV: Act I - Prelude of Blancheur and Noirceur. She was pursued by Lyney alongside Lynette, the Traveler, and Paimon, but was able to escape, albeit without the stolen items.
She would later be seen as an audience member in Lyney's magic show at the Opera Epiclese during Archon Quest The City of Rains and Remembrance in Chapter IV: Act I - Prelude of Blancheur and Noirceur. She had intended to go to the show in order to destress, but after learning that the show had been sold out, she stole a ticket to get in. She would use the alias Halsey, a famous Fontaine artist, in the registration.
During the show, she was selected by Lyney's random number generator to participate in a special trick. However, unbeknownst to her or Lyney, she was targeted by Marcel as part of kidnappings and experiments involving young Fontainian women to bring back his love Vigneire by pouring them with Water from the Primordial Sea. Marcel had tasked Cowell with acquiring the subject, who rigged the random number generator to always select Liliane's seat. Cowell proceeded to place a balloon with Water from the Primordial Sea inside the magic box, which would pop when the magic box descended into the tunnel and a metal hook pierced it, therefore dousing the victim with the water. Cowell then sabotaged the rope holding up the water tank to make sure that once the victim dissolved and the magic box reached the stage after being transported through the tunnel, the rope would quickly burn and the water tank would fall and spill water onto the stage, thereby destroying the Water from the Primordial Sea used to commit the crime. However, as she hailed from Mondstadt and the water only worked on people from Fontaine, it had no effect on her and she instead found herself drenched in a tunnel. Cowell, who believed that the water needed time to take effect, tried to subdue her, but Liliane overpowered him, smashing him with a vase that the rest of the audience heard as a loud thud. She then put his body back in the box, unaware of the sabotaged rope and water tank and changed her clothes, hiding in a box in the tunnel.
The act resulted in Cowell being killed, smashed by the sabotaged water tank. Lyney was initially accused of causing Halsey's disappearance and killing Cowell, which resulted in him and Lynette becoming defendants in a trial. As Neuvillette ordered the entire opera to be shut, Liliane was unable to leave and became hungry, stealing some macarons that Navia had made for herself, the Traveler and Paimon. The Traveler defended Lyney in court, but all seemed to be lost when Vaughn, another associate of Marcel's, revealed Lyney had stored the Primordial Water in his belongings. Navia then realized that something was off and discovered Liliane outside the court room, correctly identifying her as the suspect that had stolen her macarons, convincing her to testify on Lyney's behalf in return for a reduced sentence. Liliane agreed returned to the court room with the same magic trick Lyney had used, confessing to the entire crime. She revealed that she had hidden because she feared that she would be sent to the Fortress of Meropide, believing that Lyney was onto her after their encounter at Romaritime Harbor. 
Her testimony resulted in Lyney being absolved of the charges placed against him by Furina. While Neuvillette stated that her actions would warrant additional investigation, presumably for her thievery, she was not charged for Cowell's murder.
