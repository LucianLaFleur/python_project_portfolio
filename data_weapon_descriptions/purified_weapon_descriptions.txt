Gameplay Notes[]
The passive cannot be activated on hits that deal no DMG, even if they score a CRIT Hit.
The passive has a chance to activate for each hit that deals damage to an enemy as well as for each enemy hit while the character is on the field. Therefore:
Multi-hit skills such as Diona's Icy Paws (5 hits) are more likely to activate the passive.
Skills that deal AoE damage such as Venti's Skyward Sonnet are more likely to activate the passive if the skill hits multiple enemies.
If the character equipped with the weapon is not on the field when they deal critical damage, the passive will not activate.
In Co-Op Mode, triggering the passive generates elemental particles for all members of the team.
Description[]
A standard longsword wielded by the Knights of Favonius. It is usually issued after the approval of both the Master of the order and the Church.
The craftsmen in Mondstadt have achieved some results in elemental affinity by studying Mondstadt's Anemo.
This light and agile sword is not only an honor bestowed upon a Knight of Favonius, but also the fruit of the hard work and skills of the guardians of Mondstadt.
It can channel elemental power with ease. Its bearer could do well to remember that its sharp blade is intended for defending, not attacking.
The traditional art of Favonius Bladework was originated by the childhood friend and spiritual counterpart of Arundolyn, the Lion of Light, whose name was Rostam, the Wolf Pup.
Legend says he could chop each drop of rain out of the sky, and that the wind from his sword dance could split the rose and extinguish the torch.
In this lies the essence of Favonius Bladework: light, swift, and precise in the defense of Mondstadt.
At age of twenty-seven, Rostam received the title of Wolf Pup.
Knights of Favonius tradition dictated that the titles of Lion and Wolf were reserved for those of great leadership potential. Such individuals would one day assume the position of Grand Master, devoting themselves to the leadership of a multitude of knights and the safeguarding of Mondstadt.
But though he fulfilled his duties faithfully, and devoted himself to Mondstadt, Rostam would not live to see that day.
Since Rostam introduced the bladework style, no other practitioner has ever matched his legendary ability.
But his fervor, along with his will to protect Mondstadt, have stayed with the knights throughout the generations.

Gameplay Notes[]
Numerous enemies' weak points will not allow this bow's passive to trigger. These include, but are not limited to, all enemies from Ruin Sentinel and Ruin Drake groups.
Description[]
An ancient prototype bow weapon from Liyue's arsenal. The batch number has faded and no records exist to confirm the date of production.
More than fifty-year-old cudrania wood was ordained in gold silk and paired with the finest steel components to make this fine bow.
Despite being made from Irminsul branches that had stretched deep down into the earth, the bowstring is exceptionally pliable, guaranteed to never snap.
The house of Yun in Liyue promoted a set of legendary prototype weapons to break free of their constraints and bring a new age to the power of their forces.
An exceptional longbow that is mainstream among the armed forces.
The master craftsman Han Wu personally assembled this longbow at the request of his good friend Yun Hui.
He employed every trade caravan he could find to bring to him a plethora of resources. In the end, he chose to use cudrania wood, fine steel and Irminsul branches brought back from the abyss.
The result is a beautifully superior bow, sturdy and easy to grip, and cool to the touch.
The bow's arc is as beautiful as the crescent moon, albeit a darker shade, like a light moon hanging low amidst a foggy night sky.
When an arrow from the bow pierces the sky, the string's light is thin and cold, reminiscent of an unforgettable moonflow.
This resemblance has earned the bow the title of "Crescent."
Should its beauty captivate the people, then Liyue will be sure to see no shortage of similarly inspired bows.

Gameplay Notes[]
Any Normal Attack, Charged Attack, Plunging Attack, Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst can be used to trigger the on-hit effect, even if no damage is dealt.
Only one stack is gained even if multiple enemies are hit at once.
Gaining a stack will refresh the duration of all existing stacks. In other words, the effect persists for 8 seconds after the last hit, regardless of the number of stacks.
Stacks cannot be gained if the character equipped with this weapon is not on the field.
If the character equipped with this weapon is switched out of the field, any existing stacks will last for its usual 8 seconds.
Description[]
A long time ago, a dragon there was to be found in Liyue.
Not a dragon that soared the skies, but one whose abode was the mountains.
Indeed, this ancient dragon of stone was as large as the very mountains it called home.
The legends say that it slumbered in Nantianmen, seeming not at all unlike the surrounding hills.
But when it awakened, even the tiniest movement, or the slightest stretch...
That would cause the earth to tremble and shake.
Then, Rex Lapis came before the dragon, seeking to stop the earth's quailing.
They say that for a long while, the land knew peace,
And that Rex Lapis gained another comrade by his side.
But in the end, the union of dragons, gods and men was perhaps not to be...
The dragon was sealed in the bowels of the earth. Fearing the ire of the gods and the adepti,
The Geovishaps, who once heeded the trembling of the rock and wrought havoc alongside the dragon,
Fled into the roots of the mountains. But as millennia passed, the dragon began to stir once again...
The legends hold that those who triumphed over the dragon stabbed this sword into the ground next to the giant tree that subdued the ancient dragon.
As one of the seals, monsters and malevolent mortals would be unable to touch it.
Indeed, if the legends are true, only those with hearts as pure as clear mirrors could even come near it.
Yet, if those legends are true, how did this sword come to be lost?

Trivia[]
The dragon discussed in this weapon's lore refers to Azhdaha.
Etymology[]
Its description "edgeless" (Chinese: 无锋 wú fēng) and its Chinese name "Sword of No Skill" (Chinese: 无工之剑 Wúgōng zhī Jiàn) likely refer to the Chinese idiom "heavy sword is edgeless, great technique is to be skilled in nothing" (Chinese: 重剑无锋，大巧不工 zhòngjiàn wúfēng, dàqiǎo bùgōng).
It means that one should not rely on extravagant tools and showy skills, and instead they should focus on cultivating a simple and natural state of power and mind. The idiom originates from the Chinese wuxia novel The Return of the Condor Heroes written by Jin Yong in 1959, but the idea itself ultimately comes from the Taoist philosophy (wu wei or "no action") in ancient China, notably Tao Te Ching by Laozi.[1]
In Jin Yong's novels, it was a sword wielded by Dugu Qiubai (the strongest character in the series) in his 30s. Later he mastered a technique that allowed him to use anything as his sword (including grass, trees, bamboos, and rocks), and finally he reached a godly state that he was able to perform his sword arts with no physical swords. Considering Morax is the very greatest warrior of Liyue, by analogy, the line "Yet, if those legends are true, how did this sword come to be lost?" may indicate that he later mastered power to seal Azhdaha without this sword.
Dugu Shuo, a boy in Liyue Harbor, may be related to this reference, as he has the same surname as Dugu Qiubai and is obsessed with powerful swords.
The same Taoist theme is found in the lore of the bow Rust, where a famed archer realized that the ultimate shot is no shot.

Description[]
An ancient catalyst from Liyue's arsenal. The batch number has faded and no records exist to confirm the date of production.
The disc represents the cosmos and thus takes a circular form. At the center is a piece of Cor Purum, representing a heavenly body suspended in the firmament.
After the great chaos subsided, sinister forces still remained in the world. Thus, people abandoned traditional martial arts and tools and espoused the supernatural arts.
But the techniques used in catalyst production were antiquated, having remained unchanged in over a century. Thus, the catalysts of that age were fragile and broke on first use.
The thaumaturges flocked to Liyue and pleaded with Yun Hui, head of the house of Yun, to design a new type of catalyst for them.
Yun Hui proceeded to add a catalyst to the then-new series of improved weapon designs known as "the prototypes."
The disc is made of wood and rare ore. The Cor Purum in the center was a gift from the thaumaturges.
Cor Purum is produced by firing Cor Lapis in an urn for seven days squared (that is, forty-nine days) and then steeping it in fresh water drawn from a mountain spring for a further seven days squared.
The dual purification of fire and water renders Cor Purum unbreakable, and the thaumaturges also believe it allows the stone to act as a vessel for primordial cosmic energy. A catalyst with Cor Purum at its core can channel cosmic energy with the turning of the disc. Twelve full turns works the energy into its purest form.
Yun Hui observed that the Cor Purum had a warm, golden glow like that of amber. After discussion with the thaumaturges, he proposed to name the catalyst "Prototype Amber."
Thereafter, all catalysts made in Liyue were modeled on Yun Hui's prototype.

Description[]
Scriptures of the ancient winds, passed from generation to generation among the observers of ritual in service of the Anemo Archon.
Countless hands have touched the now-yellowing pages of this book, though any prints they left have since been carried away by the wind.
In the era when the Storm Lord reigned from his tower up high, desperate appeals filled the scriptures.
Then, in the era when the sands of snow thawed, the joy of the sprouting greenery flooded the pages.
In the days of yore, when the ruling aristocracy pulled at puppet strings to control the masses,
The scriptures in the hands of slaves told of their envy and their desire for the thousand winds.
The people of Mondstadt lived, endured, fought, rejoiced, and enjoyed freedom.
As the precious years passed, the scriptures grew thicker and heavier.
When Mondstadt was born anew, and the Church finally unshackled,
The scriptures of the winds could bear no longer being confined to a shelf,
And so the book took flight, left the Church's treasury and was gone.
Like the winds of Mondstadt, and like the people of Mondstadt,
It belonged to freedom and the winds.
The elegant handwriting on the title page reads:
Children of the Anemo Archon, heed these words:
From the winds we have come, and with the winds we shall go.
Never, ever grieve for me.
'Tis but my flesh and bones which rest in the soil:
My soul has become one with the thousand winds.
When flowers bloom, when leaves sway,
That is me who sings the songs of freedom, of the winds.

Description[]
"... Uh, what? A cheap cardboard claymore? No, no, no, this is... Well, it's... the Ultimate Overlord's Mega Magic Sword, once used to triumph over the Crab Emperor!"
A long, long time ago, before Romaritime Flowers came to have that name, in distant seas dwelt the great Crab Demon Emperor.
Now, no one truly knows what made this crab great, nor do any know where this emperor ruled or where its subjects were, but since all attested to it, so did the mighty name of the Demon Emperor spread throughout the seas. Perhaps one might put this down to natural nobility? It was with this thought that the Crab Demon Emperor would slowly come to accept the truth that all gave it a wide berth.
Just as the high-and-mighty (or perhaps that was simply how they thought of themselves) humans, this great eminence would often lament that its position precluded having friends (although this might itself might also indicate high-and-mightiness). After all, those clicking crab claws could easily scare those who antagonized you, and cut the threads of fate for those who insisted on doing so. And the hoard of gold coin that the emperor owned, that stood as high as Mont Automnequi, could buy it all the delicious cookies in Fontaine — and that was a life fit for a ruler, was it not?
But without good friends to play with it, at once driven to boredom and sadness — which no amount of cookies could cure — the great eminence had to resort to using those great claws to trim seagrass. And alas, the crab emperor was still a crab, and though he might do all things better than crabs, his skill at trimming seagrass was no better than that of an ordinary stingray!
One day, while the mighty Crab Demon Emperor was blowing bubbles, alone and forlorn, he bumped into a little Melusine...
"Ah, ah, ah! Who dares step into my demonic domain? Why have you come?"
(Though the Crab Emperor was erupting in flame, he was in truth a little happy, and also afraid. When other sea beings saw him, they would flee on account of his majesty, and so the Emperor had not spoken to anyone for a long, long time.)
"Mr. Crab," the little Melusine said, "you don't seem very happy. Let's play together. That'll cheer you up!"
"You do not understand," the Crab Emperor began, and though he wished to take the Melusine to task on account of her trespass in calling him "Mr." instead of "Your Majesty," he instead finished, "an overlord cannot play with little Melusines, or he shall lose his kingly majesty."
"And what would happen if he loses it?"
"An overlord without majesty is no overlord at all. Were it not for my claws being larger and my armor thicker than that of other crabs, I am ordinary, just like them."
"Well, Mr. Crab, your claws are bigger than me, and you have more legs than I do. Your armor is thicker than the walls of my house, and other than gold coins and little cookies, you've got so many other nice things. You should be very happy! Hmm, I know. It must be your kingly majesty that makes you unhappy."
"Little Melusine, you have never been a king, and so I forgive your ignorance. Know that an emperor should not care for his own happiness."
"But before you were king, you must've been a crab, right, Mr. Crab? Oh, your unhappiness makes me unhappy too! Tell you what — I'll help you give up your kingly majesty!"
"Hah! Little Melusine, you speak of things far beyond your ken. When in history has an emperor given up their rule?" The Emperor waved his claws in a rage. "Unless... For example, and just as an example, a hero should defeat the demon lord using their holy blade... That way, even a former overlord must be content playing with the little Melusines."
"Oh, so that's how it works!" The Melusine exclaimed happily, before then falling into thought, and saying, crestfallen, "But I don't know where to find a hero, or where a holy blade might be..."
"Oh, don't you worry! So long as they can defeat the demon lord, anyone can be a hero, and any weapon can be a holy sword," the Emperor said hurriedly. "Mwahahaha! Now do you understand, you impertinent Melusine?"
"'...And that's what Mr. Crab told me. Please, everyone, lend me your strength!'" She said. And all the Melusines in Merusea Village thought that indeed, they should help her! And so they arrayed her with a great seashell for a shield, crowned her with a seagrass laurel, and canvas from a wrecked ship within Elynas they brought for her cloak. At last, they armed her with a rare piece of dried cardboard — her treasured sword.
Thus did the Melusine heroine embark on a journey to defeat the Crab Demon Emperor, and with her peerless magical blade did she cast the marauding tyrant down. And from then on, Mr. Crab, now longer a demon lord, would become the Melusines' good friend...
After some discussion, the Melusines reached a consensus. This, the mightiest sword in Merusea Village, that had shone so illustriously in the shadowed mists of the past, should be given to an unparalleled hero, as a memorial to their friendship.

Description[]
An ancient prototype sword from Liyue's arsenal. The batch number has faded and no records exist to confirm the date of production.
A swirling cloud motif is etched into the body of the blade, which gives it a faint golden glow in the sunlight as it swings through the air.
It is said that the bladesmiths behind this weapon reached the extent of their abilities and were forced to innovate.
Yun Hui, head of the house of Yun's family forge, approached renowned craftsman Han Wu. With the combined expertise from both sides, Han Wu drew up designs for a new series of weapons, simply named "the prototypes."
The very first sword made following this design already had the feel of a formidable weapon.
While trying out the sword at Mt. Tianheng, Han Wu accidentally dropped it on the ground.
The sword responded by unleashing a swirling tornado of energy that cut a twelve-inch-deep hole into the solid mountain rock.
Han Wu took it as a sign from the heavens. He declared, "This sword shall be named Rancour, destroyer of rocks."
This sword shakes mountains at their foundations and possesses the power of a thousand peaks in its tip.
This sword that cuts through rocks like butter became the basis for all subsequent swords made in Liyue.

Description[]
A longsword used by a noble who ruled over Mondstadt. It was crafted with premium materials and master craftsmanship.
For that reason, even after being passed down for generations, it is still as sharp as ever.
Swordsmanship was once a mandatory skill for the nobles.
However, it was for the purpose of refining wisdom and elegance, not for use in combat.
Unfortunately, wisdom and elegance were eventually all but forgotten. Swordsmanship became a mere formality.
Twenty-six hundred years ago was the era of Mondstadt's most ancient inhabitants.
They swore a solemn oath, after the new Anemo Archon descended and reformed the world:
"For Mondstadt, as always. For the verdant plains, for the hills, and for the forests of Mondstadt. May they continue to flourish, as always."
"For Mondstadt, as always. For the everlasting freedom of Mondstadt from the blizzard and the tyrant, whose coldness and oppression are one and the same."
No matter what future woes might befall Mondstadt, whether human tyranny or monster infestation, and even if that tablet is destroyed on which the oath of protection is written,
The oath itself will forever be borne by the winds, gently caressing Mondstadt like a doting lover, firmly defending Mondstadt like a loving father.

Description[]
Legends tell of how the Kitsune Urakusai once earned the undying enmity of the bake-danuki by cutting the gold-lacquered screen curtains of the stage within the forest while caught up in a drunken reverie.
This act earned his sword its name, and the Kitsune's drunken dance, blade wild beneath the moon, became a tale told amongst all who saw, save for the bake-danuki.
Later, it is said that Urakusai apologized to the bake-danuki who had held the play, and gave them his precious teaset and other treasures.
And he "of the Front Gate," who had met him but once before the incident, received the blade "Misugiri" as a reward for mediating between the parties.
As for this recipient, he was slightly different from the rumors. Not only was he a strange character who had fought a vicious battle against Lavender Melon trees, but one who had a sense of elegance, enjoying plays, toys, and clothing.
When throwing himself into battle, he would garb himself in golden brocade threaded with autumn grass and clouds, and the garish oil paints on his face would give him a fantastical form.
However, neither ancient texts nor folk stories describe how he carried the great golden blade "Misugiri" in his final battle.
Instead, his weapon is always the same in many anecdotes and stories, a prodigiously-sized blade with a name just as long and difficult to pronounce as his own.
Though there are scrolls depict him wielding a sword in each hand, one large and one small, his majestic form cutting through the onrushing tide of black monsters,
According to the authoritative "Anthology" of the time, "Misugiri" had already been lost by he "of the Front Gate" in the summer of some year before the disaster.
For this reason, the blade that may never have cut an enemy, "Misugiri," has always piqued the imaginations of those who discuss historical tales while deep into their cups.
Among the Oni, who tell their history and legends only through song and chant and never through writing, there is a story that is different from or perhaps complementary to that which is recorded in the "Anthology."
After a wrestling match during a festival, he "of the Front Gate" gifted the renowned blade "Misugiri" to a tailor, who was not from a martial family.
It seems as though a young girl patched and mended a golden flower that had come loose from his haori, and he gifted her the sword at his side by way of reward.
"Whaddaya mean, you don't want a reward? How about this then: I'll trade this here sword of mine for your scissors! It won't count as a reward then, eh?"
"Huh? What're you saying? Of course it can be used cut cloth! Such a young lady, but when you open your mouth, you actually sound like one of them boring tengu!"
"What kind of lame excuse is 'there's a difference between martial families and commoners'!? You use such tiny little scissors to snip cloth! A nice long blade like this oughta work better, don'cha think?"
"No way! I'm giving you this sword because its long-winded old owner just kept rambling on, something about how famous stuff oughta get hung on walls for people to admire."
"...I'm not just giving it to you, it's a transaction, y'know! Better that you cut some clothes with it than me having that old fox popping by to ask me how the sword's doing every few days!"
"Hey, I can hear what you're saying about me! And keep my voice outta this! Whatever, just watch closely—!"
With that, the Oni abruptly stood and drew the sword forth from the scabbard, its cold edge reflecting moonlight and the festival's smoke.
Then, he cut one of his sleeves clean off with no hesitation, before sheathing the sword and sitting upright, offering the brocaded sleeve along with the sword.
This Oni warrior, who usually laughed and shouted in front of all and sundry upon the streets and cared little for minor matters, seemed a little more like a fierce fiend when serious.
"See? Even an oaf like me who doesn't know squat about tailoring can slice through cloth like butter using this here knife, so you'd best give it some credit, y'hear?"
"Alright! Take good care of it, now! I'm figurin' that you're the only one who'll put it to good use! I'll just end up breaking it."
"You want me to keep it as some kinda family heirloom? Haha, I've thought about that! But a famous sword gets sad if it ain't used."
"And if that happens, next time Urakusai shows up, he'll mock me for being a dumb lout, boring, uncultured, y'know, that kinda claptrap."
Face to face with the suddenly solemn Oni's visage, the young tailor girl of common birth was absolutely terrified.
After waiting for the girl, now shaking with fear, to accept the precious thank-you gift, the Oni let loose a few great guffaws, thinking himself quite clever, and left most satisfied.
He "of the Front Gate" thus earned the title of "The Great Idiot" among the villagers, and he did not dislike it.
Though he was quick to laugh and quick to anger, he made many friends and protected many lives in his life, which was itself neither exceptionally long nor overly short.
Afterward, when countless textless embroidered scrolls were woven for those gods, kitsune, youkai, oni, and humans who protected lives beyond counting,
Wracked by guilt for never managing to return the blade to him to help him fell his foes, the tailor designed that awe-inspiring image of his likeness wielding two blades.
But that was later. Before that would come to pass, Urakusai had to first grieve for the scattered, wandering people for years.
Whenever descendants of that Oni who bore his name saw one carrying the magnificent blade who was not the young seamstress, they would recall:
"Uncle often sighed as he cleaned that sword, blaming Urakusai for leaving such an extraordinary treasure to such an oaf like himself."
"'This thing outta enjoy the comfort and beauty of the world. How could I ever stand to taint it with slaughter and fury?'"
But to get back on topic, when the girl discovered the blade's marvelous uses off the battlefield, it was still some time before she would weave that particular scroll.
In those days, the Oni Chiyo danced in her resplendent juunihitoe, sword in hand, dazzling as dainty flowers fluttering in the spring breeze.

Description[]
An exquisite instrument with strings of different materials on every section.
When struck, every string trembles, creating flowing music.
But it is also a bow, one capable of firing arrows that target the heart. Where the music from this instrument leads, death shall surely follow.
After the Wanderer's Troupe disbanded, the harp's strings were cut with a dull blade, creating ear-piercing noises.
Only the bowstring remains. The instrument's lofty melodies are lost, but it remains a deadly weapon.
The Wanderer's Troupe could make birds fall from the sky, sometimes with the tune of the harp, sometimes with the arrows that followed the tune through the air.
Just like the wind that elopes with the harp's tune and the flowers that grow on Starsnatch Cliff, the harpist was both playful and determined.
After the uprising failed, the Wanderer's Troupe disbanded and its members fled.
The harpist stayed till the end, deftly plucking the instrument's strings and raining down a torrent of arrows to protect his comrades. He played till he exhausted his repertoire, and his arrows.
The harpist was from the magnificent and enchanting land of Fontaine. He had left to travel the world in search of his true destiny.
It is said that all the ladies of the Court of Fontaine wailed with grief when they heard the tragic news that he had left without saying goodbye.
The story is that he fell in love with a humble Mondstadt woman, but she was then selected for the miserable fate of Ludi Harpastum princess.
It is claimed that he had no regrets about dying anonymously in a foreign land.
The only thing he regretted was finally discovering true love, only to never have the chance to sing another love song.

Trivia[]
According to the Resolution of Sojourner artifact set, this weapon used to have 4 strings until they were removed, leaving only the bowstring left.
Diona is seen wielding this bow in her official Character Demo.
Faruzan is seen wielding the ascended version of this weapon in her official Character Demo.
Etymology[]
The bow's Chinese name Juéxián (Chinese: 绝弦) may be a shortened form of the chengyu (Chinese idiom) "Bo Ya severed strings" (Chinese: 伯牙绝弦 Bó Yá jué xián), which means bereavement of a close friend. The idiom comes from the life of Bo Ya, an ancient Chinese musician in the 4th century BC. He had a close friend called Zhong Ziqi, whom he considered to be the only person who understood the true value of his music. After the friend's death, he severed the strings of his qin (zither) and never played the instrument again.

↑ Chinese: 绝/絕 Jué can mean both "final" or "to sever." Since the weapon's harpstrings were cut, leaving only the bowstring, it can be interpreted to mean either "The Final String" (referring to the remaining bowstring) or "Severed Strings" referring to the harpstrings that were cut.

Description[]
"Get off the ship. Women are a hindrance here!"
The thief they called Ako Domeki turned and left.
But hearing this, the shrine maiden could not help by smile faintly.
If the person who had taught me archery had not gone forth to campaign alongside the Shogun,
Then our son would been the same age as Zaemon now.
And perhaps I would have come to be a Takamine, or he, an Asase...
Zaemon's tone, and the way he intentionally turns his back on me,
Is the spitting image of how he once did it, sword in hand.
This time, I will not let this person die.
Even if it means fighting against the Electro Mitsudomoe banner...
"Our fishing spears and swords have been sharpened. It is time to set sail."
"Well then, let's show those Shogunate lackeys Seirai's strength!"
Hearing the sea shanties greeting their departure, the shrine maiden set down her warbow.
She once secretly learned true "magic" on Mt. Yougou,
And though she felt sorry for her Master, the Tengu, she would use it here.
She would undo the great barrier that had held for a thousand years,[TN• 1]
And she would set the resentment of the moribund violet glede free,
Allowing it to ravage the ships that flew the Electro Archon's banner.
She could only hope that that old cat wouldn't come charging into the storm...

Description[]
This story takes place thousands of years ago, in an era after the foolish God-King was buried by the sandstorms.
The wandering prince, having lost his kingdom, retreated into the cascading rainforest, surrounded by the tranquil moonlight.
He had come here with the ambition to conquer new lands, but ended up being pursued by the huntress with the white bow,
And thus did the dejected wanderer come to be trapped by vine branches and, in the cold moonlight, he heard the low growls of the tiger around him.
"The rainforest trail road was so treacherous that mortals could only tell the way ahead by the moonlight breaking through the leaves."
"The flickering evening stars lit the wanderer's way but also lured him into a deadly trap."
"The huntress darted through the deepwood with her white bow, driving this intruder away time and again."
"Together with the ancient tiger and its roar, she gave the order for his expulsion, but did not take his life."
The old blind poet repeated the story of the wandering prince in a cracked, hoarse voice.
Even though he had lost his eyes long ago, he still unconsciously looked at the evening star that lay next to the bright moon.
The flickering star of the night had led the wanderer toward new hope, but also to a dead end,
And years later, when the wanderer who had nothing to lose faced death, he had to make a choice...
When the teachings of death were whispered in his ear, he finally realized the meaning of the warning...
"You belong to neither the forest nor death, so stay far from the king's palace."
"If you cherish life and memory still, do not go deep into the dark and dangerous lands."
"Stop repeating those silly words..."
"If my wandering fate leads me to the moon-white bow, and if the evening stars foretell my end,"
"Well then! I would rather accept my fate than die pursuing a falcon."

Description[]
Legends have it that this ceremonial sword once belonged to a musician, whose name has long been forgotten.
Layer upon layer of ostentatious decorations and shining gems prove this was no pedestrian instrumentalist.
According to the legends, that musician was immensely proud of an ancient, grand symphony, but never played it in front of anybody else.
For that music would no longer inspire applause or lamentation in this chaotic world, nor would any trouble themselves to transcribe such a complex composition...
There is an opera in Fontaine that portrays his life — Though none know his origins, all understand his tragedy.
Just like so many of humble origin, he decided his fate in the city to which all waterways lead.
"Students! We are the weavers of music, the harmonizers of authority, and the music will advance at our command!"
"Our music is as the waves and the ripples, the rhythm of the truncheon and the caress of a lover, conquering all who hearken!"
In the towering theater academy, the lecturers explained that magnificent music, imparting civilization and art to their ignorant pupils.
The notes on the scores and melodies were arranged in flawless order, and were played perfectly with absolute reason and wisdom...
"But, how can the will of order rely upon adherence to rigid convention? Musicians must be as those who transcend. They must become the voice of the sublime."
"The sublime must be powerful, like the cry of birds on a mountain summit, the frothing wrath of the stormy sea. Order must have boundless passion."
"And after, glory shall proceed from passion, passion shall create unity, and unity shall stabilize order — this must be the essential role of music and musicians."
"The passion from vanquishing one's foes, from loving one's comrades — these are the sublime emotions that separate humanity into masters and slaves."
Later, just as the opera sang, this unique understanding and interpretation of the music elevated the musician to the loftiest of halls...
In that age, under the direction and sole authority of the musician, music became the scepter and shield of authority, conquering countless listeners.
In the golden era, the listeners were intoxicated with this sublime beauty, and shared joy and sorrow in pursuit of the same passion.
But when the people's sight is blocked by a mountainous wave, the wailing of those devoured will be silenced...
And when that towering theater academy was finally destroyed amidst the tsunami, the people were terrified to discover—
The skeletal corpses of those burned away by the musician's passion, exposed at last, sticking up from beneath the foundations.

Description[]
A notebook that was shared among the members of the Wanderer's Troupe. It contains musical scores and travel journals. The history of the troupe has been lost, since it was disbanded before Mondstadt was rebuilt.
The notebook records the experiences of the Troupe, the lands they roamed and the worlds they witnessed.
It siphons great power from the records of the Troupe's performances as well as the cheering of the crowds they performed for.
The Wanderer's Troupe was founded during the reign of the Aristocracy.
Many referred to it as the Swordsman's Troupe — some out of hope, others out of fear.
Even poems and songs were denied the right to freedom in that era.
For flutes they had swords, for harps they had bows, and their song was an anthem of rebellion.
Their final act was an attempt to storm the city and impose the death sentence upon its tyrannical rulers.
The Swordsman's Troupe had gone, and with it the memory of their rebellion.
But the spirit of resistance they embodied will always flow in Mondstadters' veins.

Trivia[]
The "Widsith," also known as "The Traveler's Song," is an Old English poem. In the poem, a poet named Widsith (Old English: Widsið) wrote about people, kings, and heroes of Northern Europe's Heroic Age. The name itself comes from Old English widsiþ, meaning "long journey" or "far-traveler."
The names of the theme songs, Recitative, Aria, and Interlude, come from opera terms.

Description[]
Gurgling water once flowed into the yellow sand, but that was a long time ago.
The great being would follow the brontides and divine will into the desert in latter days, but few would survive in the end.
The fish that once shot forth like an arrow across a huge lake on the plateau,
That would stretch out as straight as a spear, cruising back and forth between the sacred sites,
Would see its stream seep into the sand, its lake shrink into a puddle,
Till at last, it wound up curled in a little plash, at the mercy of passing pilgrims.
The lesson of this story is as such:
As long as your are pious and kind, you can get a fish even in the midst of the desert sands.

Gameplay Notes[]
The Skypiercing Might effect is a unique character buff that appears as a blue glow around the weapon holder.
The Version 1.0 description of the buff was mistranslated — in reality, it adds another Physical DMG hit to Normal and Charged ATKs, similar to how Crescent Pike works. The description has thus been changed to reflect this since Version 1.3.
The buff lasts 12 seconds and will remain active for the entire duration even if the holder of the weapon is switched out.
The Physical DMG hit bonus benefits from Physical DMG Bonus and can also critically strike.
The buff effect does not apply to other team members.
Description[]
The sky-piercing fang.
It once pierced the black-gold scales of the kingdom of the abyss,
and cut the throats of the sons of ancient sinners.
Mondstadt was once threatened by the shadow dragon Durin.
Its jealousy for Mondstadt's prosperity begot evil, poisoning the land.
In those dark days, Mondstadt was surrounded by monsters and barren lands.
Hearing the people's cry for help, the Anemo Archon descended and awoke Dvalin.
Dvalin rode the wind and soared up to the sky, fighting for all life.
Blessed by the Anemo Archon, Dvalin fought the shadow dragon.
Clouds broke, and the sky burned red as if the end of days was upon Mondstadt.
Eventually, Dvalin's blessed fangs pierced through the throat of Durin.
Durin fell, but Dvalin was poisoned by Durin's tainted blood.
Unable to bear the pain, Dvalin fell unconscious.
Even the most learned bards knew not where he slumbered.
Centuries passed, and Dvalin's sacrifice was all but forgotten by Mondstadt.
When Dvalin finally awoke, gone was his friend and the sound of his comforting lyre.
And the ones he once protected now cowered in fear at the sight of him.
Honor reclaimed, poison cleansed,
Ballads shall give back a people's forgotten memory.
A prayer, this sword is. May Dvalin's name be restored.

Maximum Energy capacity for a character is the energy cost of the character's burst, e.g., Dawn costs 40 energy, so Diluc has 40 Maximum Energy.
Description[]
This blade was once used by a mighty general of Watatsumi.
It is said that he only knew as much of swordsmanship as the "Getsumouun" and "Yuushio" styles he taught himself,
And yet by their grace was he never vanquished by any mortal in a duel or on the field of battle.
It is often said that snakes and fish are both cold-blooded. But cold-blooded creatures ever seek the promised land of warmth.
To see his people's dreams fulfilled, Omikami challenged the gathering storm clouds to war.
Amongst the people of Watatsumi bent upon conquest, a young man stood out from the rest.
His fearless valor won him great love in Watatsumi, and they named him Touzannou.
But after many years passed, his kingly name was forgotten, only to be replaced by the epithet by which his foes knew him:
"Akuou," the wicked fangs and claws of the Great Serpent, the savage, demonic invader of Yashiori Island...
The slaughter had hardened the young man into a warrior. But to him,
Only the wish he made before departing, a wish made upon the moon reflected in the waters beside the shrine, was eternal.
"One day, I shall set myself above Mt. Yougou, overlooking the palace of the Lord of Thunder."
"I will have a joyful showdown against the legendary Great Tengu of Yougou upon the roof of Tenshukaku."
"...And then I'll bring that tengu's mask back to Ayame and Mouun as a souvenir!"
At last, the tides washed all their dreams away like towers in the sand.
The tengu's mask, shining like a crimson star, was shattered like seashore gravel amidst the chaotic battle,
Nor would the shrine maiden who shone like moonlight into the young man's soul ever return again,
While the Akuou himself would face the blinding ray of lightning alongside the Great Serpent.

Description[]
The whole world flocks to the commercial port of Liyue, much to the city's pride.
With the tides of people also come exotic treasures.
This compound bow may be small in size, but its unique design and superior craftsmanship have made it more destructive than most common longbows.
It is also harder to maintain than other bows. For it is not merely a weapon, but the culmination of the wisdom of a foreign kingdom.
Made by a foreign scholar, this compound bow has been modified with a pulley.
The scholar had no heart for violence, and bore no desire to see blood drawn.
But mesmerized by the curve of the drawn bow, and the quiver of arrows in flight,
He was driven to transform the compound bow and make it more powerful.
The scholar knew from the onset of his endeavor what his creation would become — a tool of war, that would bring nothing but death.
But he was lost in his pursuit to perfect both structure and materials,
And there was to be no stopping him as he fled this reality.
Though one day the bow was taken up by a soldier, who promptly shot down a wild goose.
"This is the bow I seek"
Said the heartless soldier, commending the weapon in his hands,
As the final cry of the bird he had murdered pierced his heart, just as his arrow had pierced the bird's.

Gameplay Notes[]
The passive cannot be activated on hits that deal no DMG, even if they score a CRIT Hit.
The passive has a chance to activate for each hit that deals damage to an enemy as well as for each enemy hit while the character is on the field. Therefore:
Multi-hit skills such as Diona's Icy Paws (5 hits) are more likely to activate the passive.
Skills that deal AoE damage such as Venti's Skyward Sonnet are more likely to activate the passive if the skill hits multiple enemies.
If the character equipped with the weapon is not on the field when they deal critical damage, the passive will not activate.
In Co-Op Mode, triggering the passive generates elemental particles for all members of the team.
Description[]
A standard recurve bow wielded by the Knights of Favonius. Only issued to the best archers long in service of the order.
Expertly crafted, the oak frame provides superior strength while the addition of metal parts makes it easy to use.
The bowstring is enchanted with the secrets of alchemy and magic, granting protection to the fingers of the archer.
This bow serves as a reward to the worthy guardians of Mondstadt, and a fine tool with which for them to continue in their guardianship.
The Knights of Favonius once had a formidable team of archer scouts known as the Outriders.
The team was founded by a mercenary leader from Liyue, who passed on his lifetime's worth of knowledge to the Outriders.
The tracking skills they acquired, along with the ability to sense when danger was afoot, were unique among all the knights.
Hence, the skills of the Outriders were invaluable to the Knights of Favonius.
This lasted until the first of the Outriders, for reasons unknown to the Knights, ultimately left the order.
From that day, the Outrider team was a shell of its former self.
Its expertise was gone, though its structure and name have been preserved.
Nevertheless, there are still those who work tirelessly to maintain the dignity of the Outrider title.

Gameplay Notes[]
Press the Advantage requires the character equipped with the weapon to be on the field and also to be the one that deals the fatal blow.
Description[]
A catalyst made from rare blackcliff. It glows when activated and cosmic energy circulates within.
The device is circular with a piece of blood-red Cor Purum fitted in the center. The Cor Purum seems to wax and wane like a crimson moon, growing steadily brighter and then steadily darker in a never-ending cycle.
"The myriad mountains of Tianheng are a trove of a thousand treasures, for deep within the rocks bounteous jade gleams gloriously." This is to say, mining prospered in Liyue under Rex Lapis' rule.
One by one the ore deposits in Mt. Tianheng and the surrounding area would run dry, and the miners would dig further. The result was a network of mine shafts stretching across the region in all directions. At their deepest point, the mines reached all the way to the earth's core.
Slowly, the once-quiet region was beset by increasingly frequent disturbances. With a deep growl, the earth would tremble, causing landslides on the mountains and cave-ins in the mines.
In the night, the aggrieved souls of the innocent who died in the disasters could be heard wailing in the distance.
Then one day, a stranger arrived at Mt. Qingce.
The stranger was dressed in a full-length gown and spoke in an esoteric and eloquent manner. He claimed to be a thaumaturge visiting Liyue on a quest to find two craftsmen by the names of Yun and Han.
Yun Huang, the first daughter of the Yun family, was then resident in Qingce Village. She immediately sent a messenger to fetch Han Ce, first son of master craftsman Han Wu.
The thaumaturge informed them both that in the past, the Yuns and Hans had jointly crafted a catalyst for the thaumaturges of the world.
With unrest now spreading through Liyue, the thaumaturges wished to provide the Yuns and Hans with a piece of crimson Cor Purum, in the hope that it might help the people of Liyue through this troubled time.
On receiving the message, Yun Huang and Han Ce lit the furnace at once and crafted a blackcliff catalyst with the crimson Pur Lapis as its core.
The crimson stone resonated with the ley lines of the earth. A blood-red glow would fade in and out as if to give forewarning of imminent tectonic activity.
Just as the stars guide those who travel by night, so this catalyst was the light that gave safe passage to the people in Liyue through that tumultuous time of landslides and cave-ins. It was placed at the foot of Mt. Tianheng for all to see.
When peaceful days finally returned, the Blackcliff Agate quietly disappeared without a trace, just as had faded the fury of the earth's core.

Description[]
A weapon favored by the Millelith of yore.
Made from a lith of the Guyun Stone Forest, said to be able to pierce even through dragon scales...
Its great weight prevents the Millelith of today from equipping it.
In ancient times, the Millelith would conduct themselves in Rex Lapis' name according to this axiom:
"While rock stays hard, the mountain shall never fail; while the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail."
In the past, they went forth to subdue demons and protect the roads and the countryside.
In these peaceful times, their duties have shifted to maintaining order.
At a certain point in the past, the earth did shake, and the mountains did tremble.
Then, the Millelith gave out equipment left over from the ancient wars to those among them who were of unusually great stature.
These were the incredibly weighty Lithic Spears, and they were used as shoveling tools to rescue the injured.
"The Lithic Spear pierces through rock with ease."
"If a thousand such spears could be lined up in formation today, none could stand before them."
Yet in an even earlier era, when the world was in yet deeper turmoil,
Every soldier in the Millelith could wield these colossal weapons.
Thus were they able to protect Rex Lapis' kingdom and defend their homeland.
With a thousand Lithic Spears lined up in formation, no evil could prevail against them.

Weapons in Genshin Impact are equipment that assists the player in fighting to deal more damage. It is the first tab in the Inventory.
There are currently five different types of weapons in Genshin Impact. Each character is only able to wield one weapon type. Visit each weapon type's page (Bows, Catalysts, Claymores, Polearms, or Swords) for a list of all weapons of the respective type. See Weapon/List for a list of all weapons.
Weapon level can be increased with Weapon EXP, which is generated by other weapons or Weapon Enhancement Materials.

Weapon Types[]
Icon
Type
Info
Swords
Sword attacks are the middle ground of melee weapons. The damage and speed of their attacks are comparable to those of Polearms, though with a shorter reach.
Claymores
Claymores attacks hit slower than melee weapons like Swords and Polearms, but deal much more damage per swing. Due to being considered Blunt Attacks, Claymore attacks deal increased damage to Geo objects, such as monsters' shields.
Polearms
Polearms have fast attacks, long forward reach, and deal moderate damage per hit.
Catalysts
Due to their magical nature, all Normal and Charged Attacks performed with a Catalyst are considered elemental damage. The element of the damage depends on the wielder's natural element/vision.
Bows
Bows boast long-ranged attacks, with Charged Attacks that are capable of hitting monsters as far as the eye can see with proper aim. A fully-Charged Attack deals elemental damage.
Quality[]
All weapons have a quality ranging from 1-star to 5-stars. Weapons with higher quality/stars have higher scaling on their stats than weapons of lesser quality but are more difficult to obtain, and also require more Weapon EXP to level up.
Example: Even if Debate Club (3* Claymore) and Wolf's Gravestone (5* Claymore) are both Lv.20, the Debate Club will have only 87 Base ATK and an additional 9.8% Base ATK as a 2nd stat, while the Wolf's Gravestone will have 160 Base ATK and an additional 15.1% Base ATK as a 2nd stat.

Stats[]
Secondary Stat[]
Weapons that have a quality of 3-stars or higher have a secondary stat that provides the wielder with a bonus that scales with the weapon's level, just like its Base ATK. One of the following secondary stats can be given, depending on the weapon:
ATK Weapons
DEF Weapons
HP Weapons
CRIT DMG Weapons
CRIT Rate Weapons
Elemental Mastery Weapons
Energy Recharge Weapons
Physical DMG Bonus Weapons
Base Attack Scaling[]
Main article: Weapons/Base Attack Scaling
Secondary Stat Scaling[]
Main article: Weapons/Secondary Stat Scaling
Passive[]
Weapons that have a quality of 3-stars or higher have a passive along with their secondary stat. These passives can range from something simple - buffs like Raven Bow's "Bane of Flame and Water" passive that gives an increase in damage dealt to enemies affected by Hydro or Pyro - to something more complex like The Widsith's "Debut" passive which provides one of 3 random buffs when you switch to the character that has it equipped.
Refining[]
Weapons' passive effect can be increased by refining. It will be increased with every rank, up to a maximum of rank 5. Every weapon that has a passive effect can be refined by consuming an identical weapon.
If you have two copies of a refinement rank 2 weapon and refine them together, you will end up with a refinement rank 4 weapon. This holds true for all refinement ranks. However, you cannot exceed refinement rank 5 by doing this. Please note that your enhancement materials will not be refunded by doing this, if any were used.
Refining Flagship Event-Exclusive Weapons and Fishing Association-Exclusive Weapons will require specific refining material which is only available during the event. (Example: The refinement material for Dodoco Tales was in the Midsummer Island Adventure event shop. Buying all available 4 refinement materials from the shop allows the player to refine their Dodoco Tales to refinement 5.)
Trivia[]
Besides the 5 playable weapon classes, there are numerous other classes of weapons used solely by enemies or by playable characters as part of certain Talents.
Flagship Event-Exclusive Weapons have been given with Refinement Materials to reach Refinement Rank 5 in every other Version Event. Only one copy of each weapon can be obtained.

 Sword of Narzissenkreuz (Quest) appears during World Quest Series In the Wake of Narcissus.
Fontainian weapons emit Pneuma or Ousia when equipped by a character who has Arkhe.
Many talents, but not all, will summon the character's weapon in their hands, or by their side in the case of Catalysts. Light attacks while the character is idle may also cause the character to arm themselves with their weapon and take a combative stance. When a character has idled in combat stance long enough, they will put away their weapon, which will reappear behind their back for some more time before disappearing fully. If the weapon has already been put away as part of a character's Talent animations, it will reappear behind their back as soon as the character's attack animations end.
A large majority of characters have their weapon appear vertically and behind the center of their model when put away. Exceptions include Kamisato Ayaka, Kirara, Furina and Chiori, whose Swords appear sideways, and Wriothesley, whose Catalyst appears behind his right shoulder.

Description[]
They say that this long polearm was forged using materials that are not from this world.
The weapon has passed through the hands of many loyal yet unfortunate souls.
It has seen many a slaughter begin and end, and tasted many a foul beast's flesh and blood.
It is said that a person whose job was to exorcise evil once came to the great chasm of crystal sands.
There, they retrieved an ominous, aqua-colored crystal from its depths.
Then, they hired someone to forge it into a weapon, naming it "Calamity Queller."
"If disaster should befall, this shall surely be used to calm it."
The tribespeople who made their living in the craggy mountains were not partial to either boasts or critique.
But since there was no contract signed, and such words were of no cost, they accepted them all the same.
Later, the time came when the monstrous tides scaled the bedrock, turning the cinnabar-colored earth black.
The shield-wall of the Millelith and the dark forces clashed, and any stragglers were all slain.
Like a cold star amidst the gloom, Calamity Queller flashed this way and that at the heart of the maelstrom...
When, at last, the light of the setting sun split the mournful clouds, the dark sludge sunk back into the depths of the chasm.
The Calamity Queller was also lost, together with the Yaksha who wielded it — both returned to silence.
In times thereafter, those who wielded this spear would largely meet similar fates.
But there were people who would fight without requiring orders or protect people without taking any oaths.
For them, such a fate was hardly one to be lamented...
It is also said that this spear was once borrowed from someone.
And in a deserted, water-eroded cave, it would bear witness to a clash between intimate friends.

Gameplay Notes[]
The passive cannot be activated on hits that deal no DMG, even if they score a CRIT Hit.
The passive has a chance to activate for each hit that deals damage to an enemy as well as for each enemy hit while the character is on the field. Therefore:
Multi-hit skills such as Diona's Icy Paws (5 hits) are more likely to activate the passive.
Skills that deal AoE damage such as Venti's Skyward Sonnet are more likely to activate the passive if the skill hits multiple enemies.
If the character equipped with the weapon is not on the field when they deal critical damage, the passive will not activate.
In Co-Op Mode, triggering the passive generates elemental particles for all members of the team.
Description[]
A heavy ceremonial sword of the Knights of Favonius. It is usually only issued after the approval of both the Grand Master and the Church.
The craftsmen in Mondstadt have achieved some results in elemental affinity by studying the ancient artifacts of Mondstadt.
This heavy greatsword is not only an honor bestowed upon a Knight of Favonius, but also the fruit of the hard work and skills of the guardians of Mondstadt.
It can channel elemental power with ease. Its bearer would do well to remember that destruction is but a means to an end, the end being to defend that which must be defended.
Only a single-handed form of Rostam the Wolf Pup's Favonius Bladework survives today.
Another form has been lost to history: that of Arundolyn, the Lion of Light, who could wield both a longsword and greatsword together in battle.
Because of the great strength needed, only those gifted with extraordinary strength could attempt this form. Thus, it soon died out.
Close companions growing up, Arundolyn was from a long line of knights while Rostam was born to a peasant family.
Their childhood friendship was forged from a shared dream of heroism. As young men, they became fellow knights; as mature adults, one became Grand Master and the other his assistant.
Grand Master Arundolyn was no Vision bearer. His formidable strength came from a mixture of natural gifts and intense training.
The Grand Master's strength was his pride, and the Grand Master was the pride of the Knights — nay, the pride of all in Mondstadt.
After Rostam met his fate, Arundolyn never displayed his strength again. For no longer was it a source of glory to challenge ferocious monsters.

Description[]
A beacon that guides a traveler home from afar. No matter where they are, the silver eagle always inclines toward a distant wind. The verdant feather swirled as she sang gently, guiding the homecoming one to the other side, where the gentle wind blew.
"I don't care about where you came from, or what sins you might have committed. It's just..."
The "young master" (though he was not and could never be acknowledged as such) said as he wiped away the blood from her face.
"When the time comes for the winds of change to blow through this land, I want to have you by my side."
"I killed the falcon. Keep that a secret between us..."
Much as the kin-blood would in the future be spilled by a brutal lance and left to turn from red to black in the snow,
Her heart too was pierced, as if by an invisible arrow, when she perceived the real "young master" in her mind's eye.
From then on, she kept one eye on the things she had to do as a servant,
And another upon the "missions" that had to be accomplished for the vision he had described.
She dreamed of being by his side — no, even being in the crowd behind him would be alright,
If she could bathe in the winds — which she did not even comprehend — together with him, her real "young master."
For this purpose, there were a lot of nails and tenons that needed to be pulled out to cause the great edifice to topple...
"Don't mourn, Priscilla. Everything in this world comes at a price."
"Remember: If these matters are betrayed, light the beacon at Stormbearer Point."
"When the winds of change blow through these lands, we shall be its wild, howling vanguard, you and I."
"Yes, Master Eberhart."
Yes — she would forget bloodline and duty, forsake separation and the sickly heart.
Not many nails were left. The glories bygone would soon return.
But...
The family's falcons and hounds caught the plot's scent, and the silhouettes of sails were never sighted upon the cape.
At the last, she chuckled. Once, she had railed against her fate and the fate of countless others.
However, at this moment, when she looked up at the pale moonlight and the shadow of the swords that reflected it,
And as she gazed upon the mocking gaggle of nobles, she felt neither distress nor resentment — though she knew not why.
Not many nails are left. The glories bygone will soon return.
Young master, you will be like this silver eagle. You shall guide the hurricane.
Do not mourn for me. I shall soon be a wisp in a thousand winds...

"I was once a wounded wolf, betrayed by the whole world,"
"But we shall create a new world, one in which no one shall ever be forsaken."
"Dressed in flawless garments as radiant as the midday,"
"We came to the land of silver snow,"
"And sounded the clarion of Her Majesty's greatness."
"Oft have we walked in the moonless night."
"Oft have we trudged through the gilded sands."
"Oft have we felt piercing enmity in the dark,"
"And oft have we dreamed of lovers in distant hometowns."
"But the pale flame yet burns in our breasts."
"O Harbingers, scintillating as polar stars,"
"Guide us ever onward, tireless."
"If your dreams find no acceptance, if you nurse wounds that will not fade,"
"If you end each day discontent, if you burn with fury against false promises,"
"Lift up your eyes to the white, glimmering stars, for that is our banner."
"Join our ranks! Let our marching boots shake the earth like thunder!"
"You who will march with us towards the polestar of the white night, come! We shall never abandon you."
"You who will walk with us into the land of darkness, come! We shall create a new world together."
"Know that the destruction of all precedes the birth of a new order."
"At devastation's end, we will greet a stainless dawn."

Description[]
This story takes place thousands of years ago, in an era after the foolish God-King was buried by the sandstorms.
Mortal cities scattered across the land, amongst which Tulaytullah, where men and women of wisdom gathered and resided, was the most outstanding.
The city was dotted with buildings roofed with sapphire domes and adorned with emerald gardens of blooming trees and flowing fountains.
In the times following the God-King's departure, this fortunate city still glowed with wisdom and prosperity.
People say that a warrior named Xiphos once lived in this city of sapphire and emerald.
Xiphos was adept at wielding his double-edged sword, and he saved many a maiden from monster attacks, snatching many treasures from them in the process.
In an ancient Tighnarian lore, his sword was indwelt by a twisted, cruel Jinni,
Which was why the blade was not dulled but rather sharpened by slaughters, not smudged but instead brightened by blood.
"My dearest Master, let me feast on that rosy juice, indulge me with the crimson brew."
"My affection gushes forth only for you, like the daughter of grapevines entertains the tipplers with her bloody sacrifice."
"So long as you own my affection, and the moon shines on your ever-youthful face,"
"So long as your foes hold affection for this world, and have not forgotten their mothers' names, you shall be a warrior unmatched."
Later on, the swordsman adored by the Jinni of moonlight would encounter an exiled foreign wanderer.
The wanderer had accepted silver coins, blood money from kings opposed to Tulaytullah, and he shouldered their grudges and hatred against the hero.
Thus they who should have become friends at some bar became foes in battle, fighting each other to the death with the moonlight as their witness.
In the fight, their blades were bathed in ruby wine while the overripe pomegranate burst, vital, vivid red pouring from the rupture...
The deadly duel finally settled. The pale moon cast its cold light upon the winner and the defeated alike.
"Whichever direction the wind blows, there is never a single ripple in the cup of life."
"The three departed goddesses had long determined the heroes' fate, even if they could never fathom it themselves."
The wanderer took the moonlit sword, picked up the bloodstained silver coins, and trod in silence toward the distant rainforest.
Thus deprived of Xiphos' protection, the city lost its luster and withered away in the following years.
Its buildings and gardens were ground down into the dirt along with its destiny, and then the howling desert gales consigned them to oblivion.
Ultimately, the black key and the young prince's quest to rejuvenate his kingdom both sank into the sand's embrace...

Description[]
This fine bow has been painted black, all the better to blend perfectly into the deepest night.
This was once the first choice of an opulent noble house in their hunting games.
Till one day, it fell into the hands of a gentleman thief who was never caught.
Its user shot the crowns from the heads of nobles in utter silence.
It shot through many a tightened bond, and disarmed many a pursuing soldier.
It once vowed to bring light to a darkened age.
To bring justice, riches and gladness to the oppressed.
In the past, he did indeed bring justice, riches and gladness to the oppressed, and he brought fear unto those in power, giving them countless sleepless nights in their impotent rage.
He brought light footsteps like rain to the roofs and terraces, and he brought song to the bards in the squares.
He even once pried a sapphire from a noble's regalia to give to a blue-eyed witch, who hunted the vile with spear in hand.
But even to the last, he was unable to bring a single smile to the lips of the witch whom his soul loved, who was as cold as the sapphire he gave her.
In the end, seeking death, her flower-like face was marked with a criminal's brand, and none knew where she went thereafter.
Abandoning his vow, he sailed into the ocean that belonged to no one.
"Pray tell, does she still recall my song? Does she remember those years that pursue me even now, of the wine-scented streets and the songs sung of her?"

Description[]
There was once a popular folk song that went like this:
"Toss to the bard all the coins you can spare,"
"Give your bouquet to yon maiden so fair,"
"Take wine so bitter it makes the tears flow,"
"Drink to the yesterday now been and gone, and sing for tomorrow that comes with the dawn."
In the land where songs and music carry on the wind, the people have merry yet sensitive souls.
It is said that there were times in history when the tyrant Decarabian and the ruling aristocrats would ban certain chords and tunes,
For discerning people could sense the spirit of resistance that lay behind the music of the bards and singers.
Songs and hymns had also indeed been used before as a way for rebels to communicate.
In the days of the ruling aristocracy, the Church that revered the Anemo Archon was once split in twain by a schism:
On one side stood the clergy, who ate at the lords' table, and overturned the archon's statues with them even as they wrote songs and hymns of praise.
On the other stood the saints, who held no clerical office, and who walked the streets, the wine cellars, and the world beyond the walls.
These saints drank cheap moonshine, blessing the slave and the plebeian with the original holy manuscripts that circulated amongst the people and with words that the wind brought to them.
And while they did so, they penned forbidden songs and poetry.
When the gladiator from a foreign land arose together with the re-awakened Anemo Archon and raised the banner of rebellion,
The aged saint known as the Nameless Shepherd mobilized the true adherents of the Church of Favonius.
Together with many others, they spilled their martyred blood upon these emerald fields.
And together, they sang a rallying cry to save the nation, the hitherto-unsung half of that folk song of old:
"Leave the keen steel to those who will give their lives for the fight,"
"Prepare the thieves' gallows,"
"Sharpen your rusted arrows,"
"For when the music sounds, we shoot the beasts down."

Trivia[]
The Chinese name means "when the pine-sound echoes," and is referenced in the last line of the lore text: "For when the music sounds, we shoot the beasts down." (Chinese: 留到松籁响起之时，将那衣冠禽兽射落 "Wait until the time when the pine-sound echoes, then shoot those dressed-up beasts down.")
The pine-sound  (Chinese: 松籁 sōnglài) refers to the sound of the wind blowing through pine trees. Traditionally it connotes pure, clear, and beautiful sounds like divine songs.[1]
Since Mondstadt is full of pine trees and its archon is Barbatos, the God of Wind, Music, and Freedom, the East Asian names of the weapon may be an allusion to the time when Barbatos returns to Mondstadt in order to restore the freedom of the city.
Eula is seen wielding this claymore in her official Character Demo and one of her official emojis.

Description[]
The longbow once used by the Watatsumi shrine maiden Mouun,
It shines as pure white as the seafoam at the tip of a moonlit wave.
The shrine maiden was friends with the monsters of distant seas, and together they did battle against the thundering clouds for the sake of Watatsumi's transient dream.
The bosom companions rode the waves as one, looming ever in the spray created by the bows of ships...
On and on they went, pursuing the path of no return that Watatsumi was now on until they went together to the land of their tragic obliteration.
"Perhaps it is true that Lord Watatsumi Omikami's war was doomed from the start."
"But as long as we leave these memories behind, as long as we sow the seeds of sacrifice, this might all be worth it."
The songs of the past eulogize the tacit bond she shared with "Umigozen" as twins born of Watatsumi,
And depict them, bow drawn and spear raised, bathing in the wave-spray of a ship's bow...
These distant songs recount how she rode with Touzannou upon the back of a sea creature in the night,
The broken tomorrows she whispered of, gently and mournfully, into the hero's ear...
In yet peaceful days, the twins once sang in chorus with the great whale of the deep sea,
Telling of dismal days spent in the depths and the dark ever-night, and of Omikami and the radiant jade branches.
She once frolicked with that reckless young man, whose only strength was his strength...
"Once I bring that legendary Great Tengu's mask back, you have to keep our promise and finish that business."
"Sure, and if you're still so full of crap then, I'll get a whale to raise a wave large enough to wash that potty mouth of yours clean."

Description[]
Between two shores, past and present,
A sky stretches vast and boundless, a limitless realm of freedom.
Flowers are rooted in the earth, yet they still yearn for the endless sky,
And though they are without wings, they still seek to rise through the air...
Just as the fate of flowers is bound by the roots deep beneath the ground,
The dandelions are destined to witness the heights and freedom of the sky.
The endless azure empyrean is as if a dome that reflects the world beneath it,
With white clouds above dotting the calm and peaceful sky.
Just as the tenacious dandelions and wild chrysanthemums,
The people of the verdant ground will heed freedom's call.
The tyranny of storms and bitter winter may have oppressed them,
And the virtues they held may have become corrupt and gone astray,
But so long as the traditions of praising the skyward gales remain,
And so long as this precious freedom continues to be celebrated from generation to generation,
Then the people will ever soar to the sky like all the seeds of the dandelions,
Leaning on their spirited souls to pursue a boundless and unshackled freedom.

The inside pages of the book have an excerpt of the poem Le Jardin "The Garden" by Jacques Prévert written in the Teyvat Script: Des milliers et des milliers d'années ne sauraient suffire pour dire la petite seconde d'éternité où tu m'as embrassé, où je t'ai embrassée. "Thousands and thousands of years would not suffice to tell the little second of eternity where you kissed me, where I kissed you."

Description[]
A greatsword once used by nobles who ruled over Mondstadt. It was made using premium materials and masterful craftsmanship.
For that reason, even after being passed down for generations, it is still as good as new.
Combat was once a responsibility of the nobles.
They protected their people from monsters that threatened peace and stability.
Unfortunately, they all but forgot their responsibilities, which turned them into the very monsters they once sought to destroy.
Research suggests that gladiatorial combat originated in a religious context during the rule of the Aristocracy.
Now outlawed by the Knights of Favonius, it began as a sacrificial ceremony held jointly with prayers to the gods.
Though the practice was later turned into a perverted sport for the Lawrence Clan's pleasure, and subsequently abolished by the Knights,
Some texts of the original prayers still remain.
"O guardian winds of Mondstadt. Look after me, my friends, my countrymen, and my opponent. May the sound of clashing blades delight you, and may the offering of sweat and blood please you."
"O winds that guide my path. When I'm exhausted, bless me with the strength to keep going forward. When I'm uncertain, bless me with the wisdom to distinguish good from evil."

Description[]
"This story is about all the children who are fascinated by the moonlight..."
Sometimes, when looking at the solitary moon, the children would mourn just as the last king of the forest did as he was dying.
Another legend says that if you drink water reflecting the full moon from a small pool within the footprint of the forest king, you will become the king's attendant.
The tale of the moon goes like this: this story came from a very ancient dream, one that was hidden in a Nilotpala Lotus.
Long before Aramuhukunda had been born from the pomegranate, and before a great and noble race and your ancestors walked the earth together,
There were once three sisters. When night came, they would leave the pearl-colored palace to roam the desert, and Nilotpala Lotuses would bloom at their feet.
Ultimately, two moon-wheels shattered into dust and disappeared. The last of the sisters was so overcome with sorrow that she would never leave her palace again.
After a long time, the moon debris finally fell to the earth. At that time, the god of vegetation had already brought the forest to the desert lands.
Where the dust of the moon fell, the Nilotpala Lotuses bloom. And those children who breathe in the dust will have a pearl-like moon in their hearts.
This is why there are always children who are confused by the moon, and the reason why the Nilotpala Lotus blossoms every night, and why the moon always favors these children.
Because the three sisters, who mirror each other, long to be reunited.
The Nilotpala Lotus withered after telling this story. She had waited long — long enough for the desert to become a jungle, and for the great race to be dethroned,
Long enough for us to appear on the earth, and for the Aranara who told me this story to appear before her and speak to her.
That Aranara lost many, many more memories time and time again, until Vanarana was destroyed and we entered a dream.
But that is just as well, for the story of the moon will grow into a pearly moon in our hearts as well as yours.
Children fascinated by the moon will weep when they gaze upon it, for the moon has turned into fine sand and entered their eyes.
In countless tales, not a single tear will be in vain.

The icicle dropped by Frost Burial will deal Physical DMG, not Cryo DMG.
The second damage value (200% at base refinement) replaces the first damage value (80% at base refinement) when the icicle hits an enemy already affected by Cryo.
The icicle does not apply the Cryo status.

Description[]
When the daughter of the priestess of Vindagnyr was born beneath this white tree,
The kingdom in the verdant mountain was filled with joy when she received her blessing.
Surely, the blessing of Sal Vindagnyr would be everlasting,
Just as the undying silver-white tree whose roots pierced the earth.
That was the hope of those who wrote the annals of that mountain kingdom.
Those who had recorded the tales of countless people and events believed this in their hearts,
That the beauty and skill of their princess would be as eternal and pure as the moonlight.
When the nail that froze the world descended suddenly,
And that tree, too, would be shattered by it,
That girl took the most complete branch,
Thinking to breathe new life into the tree that once overshadowed a nation.
But in the end, the grafted life could not flourish.
The cutting snowstorm eventually covered the moonlight like a curtain of countless blades...
A long, long time later, yet still long ago —
When the deathmatch between the dragons of darkness and wind was decided at last,
When corrosive blood stained the ashen valley red,
The tree, at last, remembered that it had not died with that entombed city,
And it extended its greedy roots towards the warm ichor that irrigated the land.
Because a certain someone poured out a crimson essence upon it,
The tree that should have long died remembered its past,
And bore a single fruit from the coalescence of all its might...
Here, for those who dwelt in my safe shadow, for the priests who eulogized me,
For that lovely maiden who oft painted upon my form,
For all the happiness they could not possess — I enjoin them all into this crimson, icy fruit.
To the one who can render recompense upon this poisonous world shall it go,
And may they carry my innocent, bitter fruit as they enact justice.

Trivia[]
This weapon is the only one in the Dragonspine Series that is exclusively obtained through Forging.
The phrase "priestess of Vindagnyr" in this weapon's lore is likely a misinterpretation on the English translation's part. The original Chinese term 祭司 does not indicate gender, and the rest of Sal Vindagnyr's lore only mentions the princess' father, the chief priest Varuch.

Description[]
Feeling defeated, it dawned on the Skyrider that there are things that swordsmanship cannot achieve.
So instead of believing in his swordsmanship, he turned to the sword itself.
"Bigger is always better, and swords are no exception," he thought.
In the grand Guyun Stone Forest, he embraced his grand ending.
His dream of flight came to an end, but his sword and story would never fade...

Description[]
A golden hunting bow made of white branches that contains the blessing of the forest.
Trees with such white branches are rarely seen nowadays.
The blessings were once covered by darkened blood, but the stains have been washed away by water.
The hunter pursuing the dark herd seemed to be on a hunt without end.
Nights of waiting under rotten leaves, and days of slumbering inside chunks of meat,
All for that fatal arrow that would penetrate the heart of the prey — and then, it was on to the next target.
Gradually, the hunter stopped worrying about the wind revealing her location to the prey,
Or about using wildflowers to camouflage her human scent,
As the smell she diffused became similar to the stench wild beasts were familiar with.
She forgot the human tongue long before she became a hunter.
During her endless hunt, the time and the sun and the moon faded into oblivion,
And so did the boundless hunting fields promised to her.
Even the blind youth who first found her and gave her the bow made of white branches,
And led her onto the path of the dark beasts,
Was forgotten in her undistracted hunt.
"For the bloodstained shall never find yonder hunting grounds of endless viridescence."
"No, master, this world where barbarous beasts roam shall be my hunting grounds..."
Looking into the clear water under the moonlight, the hunter found that she, too, had unwittingly turned into a wild beast.
Following the tracks left by the beast, the black knight whose form and sword were reflected in the water found her, at a loss as she was...
"So, you were just another beast to be destroyed, tempted by the illusory silhouette of the moon in the water."
"How strange. For a moment, I thought I saw a maiden lost in the forest..."
"I must continue westwards. For the sake of justice... To settle the crime of twisting man into a beast's form."

Mystic Enhancement Ore is an Enhancement Material for Weapons that provides 10,000 Weapon EXP.
It is primarily obtained through Forging. It can also be obtained through other means such as the current Battle Pass, Chests, Random Events, Scheduled Events, Paimon's Bargains, and the Realm Depot.
For reference, to reach the daily 300,000 Weapon Experience forging cap, it takes 30 Mystic Enhancement Ores (120 Crystal Chunks) or 150 Fine Enhancement Ores (450 White Iron Chunks) or 750 Enhancement Ores (1,500 Iron Chunks), or a combination of all three.
The Inventory can hold up to 99,999 Mystic Enhancement Ores at a time.

Two different recipes are available to forge Mystic Enhancement Ore.
Limited Recipe[]
The following recipes yields one Mystic Enhancement Ore and up to 5 stacks can be ordered per forge queue slot. They shares the daily 300,000 Weapon Experience forging cap with Enhancement Ore and Fine Enhancement Ore.
Forging for 3 minutes  4 Crystal Chunk 50 Mora 1 Mystic Enhance­ment Ore

Unlimited Recipe[]
The following recipe, unlocked at Adventure Rank 30, yields 6 Mystic Enhancement Ores, 50 Adventure EXP, and 10 Companionship EXP. It is not included in the daily forging capacity, so this recipe can be used as long as the player has the required materials. Only one stack can be ordered per forge queue slot, but the short forging time makes this irrelevant. Unlike other recipes, this recipe is unavailable when forging in the Serenitea Pot.

Battle Pass[]
Battle Passes also award a significant amount of Mystic Enhancement Ores by reaching certain levels. Players can get 96 ores from the free track (Sojourner's Battle Pass) and 288 ores from the paid track (Gnostic Chorus) for a total of 384.

Description[]
"This is a story from Valuka..."
This is a story from many moons ago, when the jungle was still a shining desert of gold, and we had not yet been born from the pomegranates.
There were once three friends. They were as good a group of friends as Araji, Aramaha, and Arayama.
But one of the friends returned to the earth, while the remaining two went their separate ways.
One was determined to create a kingdom on earth and cause all sorrow to disappear,
While the other decided to spread vegetation and greenery and fill the land with wisdom and happiness.
But eventually, kingdoms will fall, wisdom will be distorted, and the definition of happiness will change.
You will forget your dreams, while we will recoil back to ours, forgetting the sun and moon.
Even so, in the depths of the desert, just as the kings of the forest leave footprints behind, and you and I leave stories behind,
The traces of our past friendship are said to slumber quietly, like an Aranara that has transformed into a seed.

Description[]
A delicate scroll treated with wax to prevent decay and moth damage.
It contains the research of royal mages — research which is still rather forward-looking to this day.
The royal mages were tasked with nourishing the water and soil as well as fighting off monsters. They also served as tutors for the nobles.
Therefore, the scroll contains a wealth of information regarding history, governance, management, and culture.
When the people overthrew the royals, they exiled the royal mages at the same time,
For the mages had forsaken their responsibility to instill goodness and virtue in the nobles, instead becoming birds of a feather with them.
In the early days of Mondstadt, the Lawrence clan was led by Venerare.
Under her guidance, the people built a tall statue in the plaza to commemorate the miracle of the Anemo Archon's descent.
The inscription beneath the statue was put there by the leader of all the clans. It bore an oath of protection to Mondstadt that they had sworn.
Over the years, the Lawrence clan forsook the noble aspirations of their forebears, and the statue was taken down.
The wise mages of the court spoke neither of history nor of the oath ever again.
In the age of the Knights of Favonius, the statue was rebuilt.
But the wording of the oath on the inscription was lost forever.

Description[]
It is said that water has no fixed color or form, and can either serve brilliantly as blade or bow.
Out of all the substances in the world, water alone is the gentlest, and also the keenest.
Among the many curious weapons of the world, this fine bow has the inscrutable ability to summon water.
"It can envelop all that is impure, wash away all filth, while maintaining its own purity."
"It can change into any form, imitate any life, capricious, yet never losing its true self."
"Divided, it is as streams uncounted, close yet untangled. United, it is as a giant wave, inexorable and unstoppable."
"Many secrets that no light may penetrate hide beneath the azure translucence."
"This is the mystery of water, that even a thousand brilliant minds may fail to grasp its myriad shifts."
Before she began working for the noble mistress of the Jade Chamber, she once heard an elderly senior expound on this teaching.
Hidden reefs and storms ever stalk the world of mercantile schemes and plays for power, and the skeletons of ships dot the seabed.
Those whose hearts brim with great ambition and sit on vast hoards of resources can often sail skillfully through in safety,
Avoiding the ever-ubiquitous competition and malice, soaring through the turbulent currents.
"That's what they say, but I lack the spirit that these big shots have, nor have I the patience for the necessary tedium."
"I'd much prefer enjoying the ambiance and aroma of a roomful of tea, and remain fascinated by the infinite possibilities that stem from the throw of six-sided dice."
"I have infiltrated many a crook's hiding place by night, and broke the schemes of enemies from faraway lands upon my knee."
"But I did not do these things to help the powerful and mighty get rid of dissident forces, but because water, too, has its source."
It is in defense of the purity of the source that water's gentleness can also become as blade and bow.
Conspiracy and coded language are interwoven with ease under the pale blue full moon — this is the wisdom of water's shape.

Description[]
When the young Arundolyn swung his replica greatsword — modeled off the one wielded by Ravenwood, the Knight of Boreas — imagining that he was cutting the old nobles of Mondstadt down, he never envisaged that he would one day become the renowned "Lion of Light." Nor did he envisage that his playmate Rostam, with whom he sparred in their childhood, would grow up to become his most trusted right-hand man, before going on to die in the course of duty, having served the people of Mondstadt for 23 years.
The replica of the Lion of Light's greatsword is now in the hands of another youngster.
How will this mysterious fate be passed on?

The English description was adjusted to clarify that Ravenwood is the name of the Knight of Boreas, and not the name of the Knight of Boreas' greatsword. Some grammatical changes were also made to the sentence after it.
Old description: [...] modeled off the great Ravenwood, Knight of Boreas' own greatsword [...] Nor did he envisage that his young rival Rostam, who later died after serving the people of Mondstadt for 23 years, would one day become his most trusted right-hand man.
New description: [...] modeled off the one wielded by Ravenwood, the Knight of Boreas [...] Nor did he envisage that his playmate Rostam, with whom he sparred in their childhood, would grow up to become his most trusted right-hand man, before going on to die in the course of duty, having served the people of Mondstadt for 23 years.

Description[]
"It is I, the masterful magician — Parsifal 'the Great'!""You will bear witness to a fantastic world, never before imagined!""This hat, for instance, leads to the legendary eastern Paradise!""Or perhaps, let us witness peril within a mirror, unrestrained by our laws of space and time!"
What is called magic is quite similar to fraud and theft,The first relies on acting and narrative creation, the second on technique.
"There was an elusive thief in Master Coppelius's play who was a master of appearing and disappearing at their leisure, wasn't there?"
"Let's use that for our stage name! Whaddaya think?"The excited youth sitting at a snack stall next to the Fleuve Cendre spoke without hesitation."Parsifal? What about me, then? Am I to be the lady of the sapphire, the beauty you stole?"Replied the youngster's partner. Laughter lit up the undercity that had never seen sunlight.
And thus, the two young thieving sisters who made their living cheating and stealing at the glorious opera house,Were dazzled by the comic stories of knights-errant onstage, and forgot their original purpose for entering the theater,And the idea of relying on their skills and technique to step onto the stage, under the shining lights, began to bud,Of using their brilliant performances to illuminate equally the dreams of those forced to stand, as well as those seated in luxurious VIP boxes.One of them would play "Parsifal," the other, her assistant Josephine.Their first performances were in Eduardo's taverns, beside the sewers, and in front of food stalls,From being before the eyes of children, brightly shining out from beneath faces stained with ash and oil and amidst the applause of the denizens,To the bright spotlights of the splendorous theater, brilliant, burning like the sun."Feathers into Butterflies," "Paradise," "Fire in the Mirror," "The Golden Fish"...Just as the light of these performances illuminated both the luxurious VIP booths and the standing audience,The name "Parsifal" became the talk of the town in the cities, both above and below.
Those clothed in purple say that all have their place, and those before the stage are no different:Whether in the exquisite booths overlooking the stage, or along the crowded floor with standing room only.Yet, though the light of the performance shines equally upon all who see it, outside the theater,Briefly forgotten anger and indignation will permeate, like tree roots penetrating a stone wall.
During the Fleuve Cendre operation, that wall finally collapsed.The girl who always played Josephine rushed back to the Fleuve Cendre.Apart from the ever-present smell of iron and rot,There was only the smell of anger, grief, and blood that had not yet dried.
All the people knew Parsifal, but an assistant is merely an assistant.If that really was all things were, it would be simple, and easy.But just as the assistant on stage is lopped in two by the sword, yet never harmed,And the missing pocket watch always returns to the audience unseen,The girl finally lost her "place" in life.And thusly she designed a "grand magic trick" that belonged to them.
"It is I, the masterful magician — Parsifal 'the Great'!""You will bear witness to a fantastic world, never before imagined!""Here there shall be no aristocrats, no kings — no swords shall be pointed at you!""None shall be born into wealth, none into poverty inescapable!"

Description[]
This is a proof that you came to this world via special means.
Only one who has challenged the "world" may wield such a sword.
When this sword was last drawn, humankind was trying to preserve a doomed world.
That world was their last and only home.
This sword was drawn to defy that fate of destruction.
—But to draw steel against the law of universe that "all who exist must one day perish..."
Surely it must have seemed the height of folly.
But really, when one is faced with such a final fate, when up against the star-devouring darkness,
What weapon would be fitting for one to wield? It can only be a sword. If nothing else, it shall bear the memory of those who faced their ends without fear...
When you wield this sword, you search for the answers hidden within this world.
In this world, such a weapon may be used without any problem.
Not for the fact that the universe casts no shadows here, and certainly not simply because it suits this world's aesthetics...
But because this search is perhaps why you descended to this realm in the first place.
When the past is dust, and the future arrives,
As the present fades away, you can trust to this blade's edge.
Having a weapon for self-defense is, of course, a good idea. After all, this one was forged for one such as yourself.
Someone who challenges and pursues.
Take it, walk this earth,
And cut open all the challenges and mysteries that it has to offer you.

↑ German: The German word Niederkunft lit. "low arrival" is an archaic word for "childbirth" or "delivery of a child." However, it can also mean "liberation" or "rescue," as Niederkunft was historically used in the Bible for the birth of Jesus Christ. This localization, along with the Portuguese localization, interpret the Chinese 降临/降臨 jiànglín as the Advent and the birth of Jesus Christ.

Description[]
This crimson polearm has seen countless battles, and has borne witness to a certain gladiator's valor.
Its ice-cold tip was often drenched in the blood of its foes, to the thunderous applause of the crowd.
Bloodstained was the gladiator's fate, and freedom, so near yet so far, was often balanced on a knife's edge.
The dull sound of that crimson tip piercing flesh was many a battle's death-knell.
As the gladiator's final performance ended, their master spoke up amidst the thunderous applause:
"The promised number has been met. You have done well, and are a warrior worthy of great renown."
"Consider this weapon to be a parting gift... Yet, would you not consider fighting on?"
"Continue your brilliant performance as a free person, for your glory and for mine. What say you?"
Many years past, and the beasts and men who fell to that spear grew too numerous to count.
The duelist's weapon became known as undefeated, but his heart belonged to his young master.
As the gladiator's final performance ended, amidst thunderous applause,
His weapon fell to the bloodied sand as the red-haired maiden's scorching blade pierced the old warrior's heart.
As he fell, despondent, he turned his eyes to his beloved master, his noble lord who cherished him...
"Eberhart, Master Eberhart... Did my final performance please you?"
But his master's seat was empty, save for a wine goblet and silver platter, toppled in haste.
"At first, I fought for myself, for blood and battle-lust."

Refining Luxurious Sea-Lord requires Emperor's Balsam instead of an identical weapon. 
Description[]
As the nights deepen, the pulsing of its gills translates as such:
"Well now, I was undoubtedly dead when I left the sea."
"My heart ceased to beat, the whites of my eyes showed, I gave off a rank stench—"
"I mean, for a fish, this had to be death, right?"
"Now, these old bones were the strongest among all mackerel."
"I was also once the strongest being in all the shallow seas,"
"And even sea beasts, whales, and sharks were no match for my might."
"And yet, even I would meet my match!"
"It was that kurage, or perhaps you might call them the jellyfish."
"Why, they just float along with the tide,"
"And yet, they can deflect any and all impacts."
"So then did I forsake the path of strength,"
"Taking up the path of the jellyfish."
"After a long, long life,"
"I became able to control every organ in my body."
"So I stopped my own heart,"
"And was not mistaken for fresh fish and sliced open."
"You may think that I am naught but a salted fish, 'tis true,"
"But allow me to become your strength."
"Now then, you who wield this old one."
"Hmm..."
"When all the waters flow into the sea,"
"When the final stars go out,"
"When everything returns to the primordial ocean whence they came,"
"Would you try yourself against me?"

Trivia[]
The weapon seems to be a reference to the One Salty Tuna Katana seen in Honkai Impact 3rd, another video game developed by MiHoYo.
Concerning the lord's species, the English version says they were a mackerel, which usually (but not always) refers to fish from the family Scombridae. The original Chinese version is more specific in this regard, stating that the lord was a chūnyú (Chinese: 䲠鱼), which is a common name for the genus Scomberomorus (a member of Spanish mackerels), especially the species Scomberomorus niphonius (Japanese Spanish mackerel), popular fish in East Asian cuisine.
Note that the lord and summoned fish by Oceanic Victory are from different species, as the lord is from the tribe Scomberomorini (Spanish mackerel), whereas summoned fish are tunas (Chinese: 鲔 wěi), or the tribe Thunnini (though they both belong to the family Scombridae).
The original English description of titanic wei (tuna) (Chinese: 大鲔 dà wěi, "big tuna") may be a pun on "Big Wei" (Chinese: 大伟 Dà Wěi), that is, miHoYo's CEO Liu Wei.

Description[]
This bow, crackling with thunder, retains its luster despite having been soaked in thick darkness.
When disaster came from a distant sea, it was once the favorite weapon of a great swordsman.
In his youth, he wandered the mountains, and he made a wager with a great Tengu he came across.
He gambled his young, strong body as a bet against a bow given by the Shogun.
As for the gamble itself, he could only sometimes recall it, when he was drunk.
But by the time dawn came, he had three wins and three losses — his contest with the Tengu was a draw.
So in the bad news, he was taken as a servant by the Tengu. But in the good news, he won that unmatched bow.
"Behold, Konbumaru, this is Tengu archery. Watch and learn!"
He was given this rather ridiculous nickname, but ultimately, he witnessed the Tengu's form.
Soaring through the clouds unfettered, unleashing thunderbolts with every bowstring's pulse...
It was a true, unreserved dance of death. Fierce and unpredictable, elegant and beautiful.
Many years later, he was no longer a servant boy, and he had grasped both some archery and swordsmanship.
He was referred to the Shogunate through a recommendation letter from his impatient master.
In the years under the Shogun, his martial skills improved greatly, and he made many friends and enemies.
Still, his hobby of unrestrained wanderlust had not changed. On the contrary, with the Tengu's great bow, he became yet more fearless.
"Let's make a wager this time, shall we? Hmm. Right, then. This bow shall be my wager."
"I bet on the mightiest bow in the world that I will return here alive."
"I'll leave it here with you for now. If I, Takamine, lose our bet, you can keep the bow."
"After all, you've inherited the essence of my archery techniques. You'll be able to make good use of it."
"But if I win..."
When disaster swept in from across the distant sea, the samurai and the obstinate shrine maiden had a mutual wager.
They bet on his safe return from the abyss against the inscribed bow bestowed by the Shogun.
When the dark venom sank deep into the earth and peace returned, the swordsman did not come back.
The Shogun's bestowed bow was given to the shrine maiden as her prize for winning their great wager.
Later, in the forest where the Kitsune Saiguu would no longer appear, in the promised meeting place,
The lone returnee who came stumbling back from the abyss finally met the shrine maiden again, though by now she could no longer be called young.
Dull eyes stained with dried blood and tears regained their radiance, but were pierced through by a barbed arrow glowing with power.
Lore[]
This bow was originally forged by the Raiden Shogun (it is unclear whether "Shogun" means Makoto or Ei) and given as a gift to the Great Tengu Reizenbou. Takamine the Mistsplitter came across the bow's owner and gambled for its possession in a duel. The duel was a draw, but Takamine won ownership of the bow despite having to become the Tengu's servant. He learned the famed art of Tengu archery using said bow, subsequently teaching Asase Hibiki the archery as well. He left the bow in her possession, as a promise that he would come back for them both, when going to fight in the cataclysm. Hibiki used it to kill him when he returned as he had been corrupted by the Abyss, therefore its last known owner is Hibiki. It is related to the Mistsplitter Reforged sword, both having been owned by Takamine.

Description[]
To cleanse by fire all that is impure, to allow the impurities to rise with the flames unto the all-accommodating high heavens.
These rites would see fresh tinder lit during the rainy seasons, and wolf smoke would arise from those fires as prayers for blessings and the defeat of evil.
These blazing rituals were especially commonplace during that ancient period of strife.
For the dreams and delusions of the silent corpses of gods would produce evil miasmas,
Snatching away the citizens who were no longer theirs, and those who never were theirs also.
Then, a merciful doctor heard a whisper from within the flame as fierce as the red sunset,
From within the crackling and snapping of withered grass.
"Only an unbound flame can purify the filth of this world."
"Lift up this scarlet firewood. With it, you shall repel every demon."
So the doctor took up that devilishly red staff, igniting all that was impure.
Those who have passed, unable to bear deep sadness, but who have since become shrouded by ill karma and calamity,
They shall be reduced to ashen butterflies in this flame, and receive relief from their misfortunes and hurts.
As for the doctor who lit those countless flames, legend has it that they, too, were reduced to smoke in the shape of a lovely butterfly.
Though these rites have been forgotten over time and with the coming of peace,
Those with fire in their hearts can still hear these whispered words from flickering flames when they find themselves faced with an imposing darkness:
"Only an unbound flame can purify this world."

Trivia[]
This is likely the staff used by the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor to purify the infected bodies during a plague that started spreading in Liyue after the negative karma of the yakshas killed many people.
In real life, Homa is a Hindu ritual that involves offering things to a fire.
The name Homa, and especially the wing motif on the top of the staff may also reference the Homa bird from Persian mythology, a legendary vulture or phoenix-like bird associated with the cycle of life and death.[1]
Hu Tao is seen wielding this polearm in her official Character Demo, in Collected Miscellany - "Hu Tao: Fragrance in Thaw" | Genshin Impact, in the one-time domain Enter the "border," and her first trial Test Run.
Zhongli also temporarily wielded this Polearm in the one-time story domains Of Mysteries and Salt, Beneath the Ancient Tree, and his second trial run, before it was later switched back to Vortex Vanquisher.

Gameplay Notes[]
The Elemental Skill CD reset effect has a chance to activate for each hit that deals damage to an enemy as well as for each enemy hit while the character is on the field. Therefore:
Multi-hit skills such as Diona's Icy Paws (5 hits) are more likely to activate the passive.
Skills that deal AoE damage are more likely to activate the passive if the skill hits multiple enemies.
If the character equipped with the weapon is not on the field when they deal damage, the passive will not activate.
If the enemy is Immune to the damage dealt, then the passive will not activate.
The Elemental Skill CD reset effect will trigger even if Elemental Skill is not on cooldown.
For Elemental Skills with multiple charges, the passive will only reset cooldown for one charge at a time. The Elemental Skill cooldown shown on the timer is the cooldown that will be reset.
There are certain specific attacks that, despite being considered Elemental Skill DMG, cannot trigger the CD reset. They include:
 Palm Vortex's Cutting DMG and absorbed elemental DMG during Cutting
 Yoohoo Art: Fuuin Dash's Fuufuu Windwheel DMG and absorbed elemental DMG while rolling
 "Come 'n' Get Me, Hag!"'s additional Phantom Explosion DMG
 Meow-teor Kick's Urgent Neko Parcel Hit DMG
 Thundering Might's additional Electro DMG
Description[]
On the cliff facing the eastern sea, the ancestors worshipped the masters of Time and Anemo together.
The two are intimately related, as expressed in the saying,
"Anemo brings stories while Time nurtures them."
This bow tells the story of the pioneers and the hardships they went through.
It used to be a prop with an immobile bowstring, but the string became both flexible and sturdier with the passage of time.
This bow was once the property of the proud Lawrence Clan.
In the far-flung past, they used it to reenact their clan's brave victory over the frozen wilderness.
The first act of the ceremony told the tale of their forebears conquering the land through their wisdom and strength.
Over their long history, though this ceremony was lost, they continued to play the same role.
But this role became corrupted. Gradually, their view of themselves shifted from conquerors, to overlords, to kings.
Gradually, they strayed into the path of depravity, and lost the affection of Mondstadt's winds.

Description[]
This is a story from the days after the Lord of Sand's dreams fell apart and the Grandmaster of Verdure hid the whispers of the demonic skies away.
The ears of decay broke the great divine realm into many kingdoms before grinding them all into sand.
A queen from amongst those kingdoms burnt the little prince's gilded robes and crown, and had him escape garbed in the sackcloth of a servant;
Years passed, and the prince was reduced to being the son of one who ruled over the slave markets, and then to a wanderer who had lost everything.
"When I could still weep over the sunrise above the tower of mirages, I offered advice to my overlord, crushing many cities at his side."
"I once blessed the son of the former king upon his birth: Even after his departure, hymns of praise for him shall continue on..."
"I have misjudged many people and happenings in the past, but no longer — for now I see nothing at all. This is destiny's punishment upon me."
"Become my apprentice. Be my eyes and describe to me the people and things in this gilded desert."
"I hope to one day weave the poems of heroes into the most beautiful tapestry to exist in the divine courts."
Coins are eroded when passed from hand to hand, but noble things become stronger as they change hands.
His last owner was a blind poet. Later, the story changed from a tale of a master and a servant to that of a master and apprentice.
"Before we parted, Mother told me that we would meet again in the eternal oasis..."
"Use this sword as the key to the paradise's gate, and rebuild the kingdom amidst emeralds and pomegranates."
Hearing the story of the wandering princeling, the aged poet caressed the dull blade of the black sword. At length, he replied:
"Thus do our crossed destinies duly end, for I am but a trifle in your epic."
"Master..."
"Xiphos, your fate is above those of us humble poets. You should not stoop so low as to write stories for others—"
"You are the one favored by the Jinni. You, who wield the Key of Khaj-Nisut, are the prince of the once-lost kingdom."
"Embark on your wanderings amongst the failing kingdoms. You shall create new tales and find the eternal oasis..."
"In the times when I wrote hymns for my overlord and love poems for the prince, I fantasized about writing for the hero of destiny."
"Allow me, please, to recount your epic — the epic of your reunion with your mother and the return of the Lord of Sand's glory to this realm."
In the end, their paths would cross — the crown prince who became a slave and then a hero, and the mercenary who fell from the throne.
Many legends mention a certain key. It is said to have commanded the sands to form a flowing river in mid-air and sealed the homeland after the Lord of Sand parted ways with old friends.
They even say that it was used to hide the desert tower and paradise of dreams away under the aegis of illusions when the bubble burst and the nations were scattered.
This key was passed between the hands of mortal tyrants and kings, till at last it, too, returned to the sand's embrace.
As for the aged blind poet, he would follow the trace of stories and blood-tainted footsteps, and finally find his way to the forest...

Etymology[]
Khaj-Nisut (Egyptian: 𓇓𓏏𓈖𓈍 (ḫꜥj-nsw.t) khai-nesut) is Egyptian for "appearance of the king" and refers to the coronation of the pharaoh.
The Chinese name instead uses the term 圣显 shèngxiǎn, "hierophany," referring to a physical manifestation of the sacred.

Description[]
"Listen well, dear Leticia. Remember that you are the eldest daughter of House Randolph."
"Understand that when we nobles sit down, we tilt the ship of state."
"And when we fall, we take countless homes and common folk with us in our crashing ruin."
"So listen well, dear Leticia."
"You must maintain your noble bearing and purity of appearance. Do not be quick to show anger, sadness, or joy."
"For our family name can grant a commoner prosperity, or send them to the Fleuve Cendre."
But though her father spoke thus, a young lady was still a young lady before she was a noble.
When one's hands are unfettered by soot or machine oil, one's heart will hanker after "adventure."
Behind her father, brother, and servants' backs, she would don a disguise and step into the subterranean city that knew neither sun nor rain.
She just wanted to see the lives of those base folk who had no control over their destinies.
Perhaps this might even be more interesting than Parsifal's magic! Such was the young lady's secret excitement.
But adventure was quite different from what she anticipated. For it was a thing unarranged by others,
And so became a tale she could not tell to her peers or her aristocratic friends during their reunions.
And when perils unseen — like music, lies, or poisoned wine — were about to be unsheathed and show their keen edge...
"Oh my. Whose daughter might you be, gentle lady, and what brings you to our Fleuve Cendre?"
It was a gentle, familiar light that cast the appalling, encroaching shadows aside.
"You're..."
His name was right on the tip of her tongue, but what slipped out instead was a question as to how her disguise had been discovered.
"Well, you're a terrible liar, for one. You've as much as admitted to being an outsider now, haven't you?"
"...And my dear lady, your clothes lack either soot or machine oil, nor have they ever been stained by blood..."
"And also, from the way you walk, you don't wear pants very often."
When asked why Reed, whom she knew, could walk freely in the Fleuve Cendre, the young man said:
"I do hope that you agree that your good father, brother, and house-servants need not know what goes on here."
"Like the Boss says, 'Let all that the sun shines upon belong to them, and let the Fleuve Cendre belong to us.'"
"Dear Leticia, please forget, at least for a time, that you are the eldest daughter of House Randolph,"
"And come with me, as but a mere person, and with your bright eyes, that have never been covered in dust,"
"See the world where your compatriots live, who, just like you, have red blood flowing in their veins, passions, and loves."
Still, this was quite a different adventure from what she had expected, and, as fate would have it,
She would experience much that she could not tell her aristocratic friends and peers, or her servants, when they would meet and chat and laugh...
"Leticia, your noble soul is one I adore."
"No longer will our axes be swung at the trees."
"And if one day, I should be lost to the glories of this world,"
"By your hand shall my fate be reckoned..."
When she met her father once more, years later, she had already taken on the name of the rose,
And she was no longer used to the fancy dresses once foisted on her, but was far more accustomed to the weight of an axe in her hand.
Yet she could not get used to the now fragile, hoary appearance of the dignified, gentle father she remembered.
"Dearest father, I have made a pact with my beloved, an oath to those I love."
"That I am still alive means that our blood is not yet spent."
"And I have yet to allow the Randolph name to be indelibly stained on my account."
"My dearest Leticia. Not a day goes by when I do not light a candle for you."
"Even now, though you wish to forsake our family name, we are still father and daughter."
"These trivial games have ended. Please, return home."
"Your child is innocent, and I will not abandon your flesh and blood for some fatuity."
"And as for your husband, well, there is some Randolph magic that can be worked there..."
But in dreams, she finally remembered. "At that time, the pounding barrage of the naval cannons had not shaken us."
"No outsiders should have known the secret paths by which the hunters infiltrated."
Lore[]
Verdict's description begins several years before the Siege of Poisson, and gives an account of how the noblewoman Leticia Randolph came to be associated with the Fleuve Cendre. Leticia fell in love with Reed and abandoned her Randolph identity to live in the Fleuve Cendre with him, "[taking] on the name of the rose" instead. Between the descriptions of Verdict and Fleuve Cendre Ferryman, it can be deduced that Leticia and her husband are the same people as Rosa and Thompson Reed, two members of Eduardo Baker's faction involved in the occupation of Poisson and the subsequent Siege of Poisson.
The ending of Verdict's description is currently left to reader interpretation. Early into the Siege of Poisson, Leticia's father offered to take Leticia, her husband, and their infant child back to House Randolph, which would spare them from the conflict. Whether Leticia accepted the offer is left ambiguous, and later, she recalls that her father's presence before her was suspicious: He infiltrated Poisson before the Marechausse Hunters did, likely through the paths that they later used. It is unclear if this implies that her father was a Hunter himself, or that a member of Baker's faction was secretly serving the Court of Fontaine; both possibilities may have been simultaneously true.

Gameplay Notes[]
Any Normal Attack, Charged Attack, Plunging Attack, Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst can be used to trigger the on-hit effect, even if no damage is dealt.
Only one stack is gained even if multiple enemies are hit at once.
Gaining a stack will refresh the duration of all existing stacks. In other words, the effect persists for 6 seconds after the last hit, regardless of the number of stacks.
Stacks cannot be gained if the character equipped with this weapon is not on the field.
If the character equipped with this weapon is switched out of the field, any existing stacks will last for its usual 6 seconds.
Description[]
At Liyue's foundation, monsters and gods still ruled the seas.
In fear the forebears lived, and fought the sea with all they could muster.
As spring turned to fall and back again for many an eon, a behemoth arose that dominated the seas. Even the Geo Archon's Geo Whale could not triumph against it.
The people of Liyue called it "Baqiu," a beast without rival even in the deepest depths of the ocean abyss. Its enormous waves would wash away entire settlements.
So the Geo Archon fashioned a black kite by hand with jade and stones.
The stone bird took to the unbound skies once forged. Into the heart of the ocean it dove, into the battlefield with the behemoth and the whale.
Into the depths of the sea the behemoth sank, there to stay forever.
Released from its thundering roars were the people of Liyue.

Trivia[]
Xiao is seen wielding this polearm in his official art, in his official Character Demo and in Collected Miscellany - "Xiao: Conqueror of Demons" | Genshin Impact.
The weapons in the Primordial Jade Series are, in Chinese, named after the piece of jade used to create it. The names of the jades are derived from a line in the Strategies of the Warring States (Chinese: 战国策), which ascribes a fine jade to each of the dynasties during China's Warring States period. This reference is not present in the English translation.
Primordial Jade Winged-Spear's Hépú is associated with the State of Chu.
Baqiu (Chinese: 八虬 Bāqiú) is comprised of the characters 八 "eight" and 虬 "young horned dragon."
This is the only weapon of the Primordial Jade Series that is featured on the Wanderlust Invocation banner.

Description[]
The circulation of money traces the very arteries of the world.
Countless lives would flow alongside the tides of blood, until they are swept away and swallowed up.
Of course, everything should have been counted among the accomplishments of humanity.
Just as numbers and mathematics were born to calculate measures of money,
There would be written records to chronicle debts, and laws to determine the transfer of wealth.
Humanity should have been the master of currency, and not its slave.
And the heart of gold should beat for the world of humanity.
—Of course, no one can truly own money.
It has merely been borrowing the hands of humanity,
To flow from one corner of the world towards the end of time.
A certain person has found this fact most difficult to comprehend,
That this so-called "corner of the world" could have been deliberately selected and defined.
That same person has also found this fact most impossible to accept,
That the great achievement that should have belonged to humanity,
Has been proposed and constrained by that so-called "god."
And this is why the system must be overhauled.
Since the heart of money has been seized by a god from a distant land,
Then they now hold the power to enslave everyone at their whim.
Even if becoming the master of the heart of gold may be an impossible task to accomplish,
The control of money should still be given equally to all.
"It may be difficult for you to imagine this with words alone, so allow me to show you how it'd look like in the world."
"We'll start by creating a new currency to replace the dependence on Mora."
"As for the location, it should be a micro-economy isolated from the rest of the world."
"I've set my sights on a nation within a nation with minimal interference from the divine."
"Infiltrating it shouldn't take too much time."
"And what should I name the new currency? Hmm, I am really not a fan of naming things. Oh, I've got just the word."
"In honor of the credit you've given me to run this experiment, I will call it the Credit Coupon."
The overseer made of precision machinery rumbles as it observes the monetary flow of the tiny nation,
Tirelessly recording the movement of every amount of money, the savings and spending of all,
The changes in value, and the number of times each piece of currency is circulated over a specific period.
The only law present is the private law of the hoarder, and the only sanctions are poverty or death.
Either to become a rentier and gain power and control, or to be subjected to control and work to death. The rules are always fair.
Thus, humanity will stand on equal ground with the Gods by virtue of their inherent ambitions and wealth,
And the weak who failed to prevail shall be swallowed by the flood that is the mortal world.
The power of the Gods shall no longer intervene to embellish the power of the wealthy before the poor,
Nor shall the wealth of the Gods descend, to rescue the dignity of the poor from the feet of the rich.

The icicle dropped by Frost Burial will deal Physical DMG, not Cryo DMG.
The second damage value (200% at base refinement) replaces the first damage value (80% at base refinement) when the icicle hits an enemy already affected by Cryo.
The icicle does not apply the Cryo status.

Archive Entry[]
He had a very, very long dream...
He dreamed that he and everyone else had gone on a long, long journey,
Into a land where green grass grew, and where soulful songs were sung.
He dreamed that he sang along with the gentle people of this land,
And danced in the skies with a dragon as beauteous as a jewel.
When he opened his eyes, he was in the sky above a mountain swept by roaring snowstorms.
The green, tranquil land had already been painted crimson by fire and blood,
And the song of that sky-blue bard's lyre was almost drowned in the howling tumult.
And that bejeweled, lovely dragon, like a tender lover,
Had now pierced his neck through with its sharp fangs.
"Farewell, Mother! My journey is ended."
"I shall sleep beneath this white, shining silver... and perhaps this, too, is good."
"Farewell, O lovely bard! And farewell, O lovely dragon!"
"Would that we had met in a different time and place,"
"To meet, to sing and dance together!"
So he thought most sincerely as he lay dying.
"Now then, this great blessing that pulses through my veins,"
"And lovely sight of the dark universe that gave me birth..."
"They are now yours to inherit."

Description[]
The Blacksmith who accepted the commission asked why this order had to be made this way and why it had to be named like this.
The answer was rather complicated: something about machine beasts that roamed all over the world, and something about polearms not having override codes.
The blacksmith understood quickly enough, though. So this bow was some powerful weapon used to hunt and kill these mighty machine creatures, and so it was the apex predator of that world.
But the strange girl corrected him.
She was just going to use this to hunt wild boars next, since it appeared that in this world, using bows and arrows to hunt would actually allow one to harvest Raw Meat.

Description[]
"O High Lord of the Nobles of Khaenri'ah, the crimson-red moon has long since fallen into the abyssal firmament, and the blindness of your blood has ended your line,""O benevolent lord who leadeth us, should you still pity the children of humanity, then drink deep the wine in this cup."It was an ancient era, before the dark sun's light illuminated the underground, and an ancient and glorious clan still ruled that vast kingdom.The dogmatic priests convinced the muddle-minded king upon the throne that the remnants of the Crimson Moon in the sky ruled all,For it is the color of the moonlight that flows beneath mortal flesh, and the darkness hidden within the bottom of the abyss shall too emerge from the Crimson Moon.This being so, the king of humanity should take upon himself the name of the Crimson Moon, and by the light and flame of two worlds judge fickle fate.Thus they yearned for transcendent individuals to build countless glorious towers, and prayed for the long-dead Crimson Moon to bring them salvation.Until the astrologists branded as heretics glimpsed in the inverted image of the false sky the origin of all the world's fate,Until the unquenchable flames of doubt and fury blazed across the dreamless realm like wildfire, finally burning to the moonlight-hued palace itself...By the time of the blackened sun, the name of the Crimson Moon had long faded along with the crimson that had flowed. Only the epithet "Balemoon" remained to stain the lingering detritus.Whether the unclean who suffered from the curse, or those unblemished ones not yet tainted by fate, none would again consider themselves a follower of the moon's remnants.Few survived the utter destruction of their kind, hiding in the shadows where the sun did not shine, longing for the Crimson Moon to decree their desire for vengeance be repaid—But the so-called repayment never came, and the dark sun fell to the same ignorance and arrogance.When destruction once again was nigh, only the mocking moonlight spilled forth upon the shadow of the sun, long burnt to ash."Fate, fate, O terrifying and pale fate, why must you abase yourself and submit to such a tyrannical usurperIf the Balemoon's remnants had already sealed your doom, what meaning could be found in the blood vengeance of bygone days?If the destiny she wove mocks us so, then let us mock destiny as loudly as we mayUntil the last shadow of the ashen sun burns away the old world, until the Crimson Moon witnesses the immaculate dawn."

Description[]
Fontaine playwrights often use strings as analogies for hearts — and indeed, this is the oft-used phrase, "heartstrings."And just like harpstrings, a person's heart will shift in shade and color according to fate's melody.The term "heartstring" is found in one of the oldest Fontainian plays, "Dryas,"Although the "string" being referenced there was at first not that of a harp, but of a bow.The main character was named Aurelius, the ur-form of the identically-named character from Coppelius's famous "The Saga of Aurelius."According to the script, he was honored as a hero as glorious as gold, who conquered countless traitorous nations and cities for Fontaine.However, there is no such corresponding figure in recorded history, and as such, he is often regarded as a fictitious invention, much like the figure of Ajax.Legend has it that while out of campaign, he fell into a trap laid by his foe, and was lost along with his army amidst the pine forest.Just as an assassin's blade was about to take his life, silver arrows pierced the air like falling rain.And as he looked in the direction of the bowstring's quivering pulse, he saw that "the gods had made such loveliness, yet destroyed the mold for pity of mortals."The young maiden, Dryastis, took his hand, a hand that should never have again felt such delicate touch, and brought him beyond the bloodstained pines."I simply desire that no more die here in vain. Too much grief has flowed through the waters already.""I ask but one thing of you, noble warrior — take this conflict away from this land.""Taint these pure waters with 'death' no longer. Let us preserve our final home."Conquering youths often believe their bodies and hearts as tough as the marble that adorns city walls.But just as all kingdoms must fall into silence, the agitated strings added dissonant notes to the hero's poetic saga...Millennia of shifting legends and theatrical edits have given this tale all manner of extended developments.In some versions, the hero, who once subdued cities and nations unnumbered, heeds the words of the fairy maiden.He accepts the proffered bow from her hands and sounds the withdrawal, only to be slain en route by conniving traitors, his body consigned to the ocean depths.In other tales, the illustrious Aurelius falls into agonizing, maddening love, he leads his army into the pine forest,Seeking her out, yearning to see her once more and make her his lover, that she might stay by his side.The young maiden flees to the riverbank, weeping as she appeals to her pure-water mother to save her from the obsessions of the hero.The ruler of the Many Waters took pity on her fate, turning her into a pine tree.Then, the bowstring that once shot love into Aurelius snapped like the heart the arrow had struck, and it fell by the maiden's side in silence, sinking into the countless blooming Pluie Lotuses.The pained young hero stared at the flowers in the water and would not leave, eventually falling into a deep pool...Natural philosophers who came after would claim that according to their research, a barbarian tribe named Dryas had once settled here,Which led to the pine forest being named as such. Such unromantic explanations have never had much to do with theater.Whether he met his end sinking into the deep sea, to have his will and desire sanded down by the passage of time,Or if he resurfaced after many years, only to be slain by the new White Armada or the Marechaussee Hunters,The tale of the youthful hero ended, and Dryastis too was rendered naught but a legend born from chaotic times.And as to how this bow, that had so disturbed Aurelius's destiny, came to pass into the hands of someone who dwelled deep beneath the waters after changing hands many times,Then be adorned and modified into a theatrical prop for children's performances in that person's homeland... That is a different tale altogether.

Description[]
A longbow made from rare blackcliff. Drawing the bow invokes a sound like the wind - a premonition of the final breeze for any target within 100 yards.
With a jet-black body contrasted by blood-red ends, it's cold to the touch without being intimidating. A shot from this bow takes to the skies like a meteor, challenging both wind and thunder.
The house of Yun has long since established itself in Liyue as a family of craftsmen. At the time of this bow's inception, the seventh head of the house, Hui, was well-renowned as a member of the Qixing.
Yun Hui had but one child, a daughter, by the name of Huang. As per family custom, should she marry, her husband would take over as head of the house.
Having been raised by an unyielding martial artist, Huang refused to take this path, and instead took over as the daughter she was, inciting endless gossip amongst the people.
But Yun Huang took control at a hard time.
The continent was troubled. Even the loftiest of peaks and deepest of caves collapsed to a symphony of low roars. The bounty of the earth beneath them became almost unreachable, threatening to bring an end to the legacy of their craft.
One night Yun Huang lay awake unable to sleep, tortured by her worries that her family's name would end with her. Amidst the sorrow that enveloped her, she could do naught but call upon the heavens and pray for celestial intervention in her desperate situation.
It was then that Han Ce, who had long since abandoned his family business and wandered the continent, arrived in the village in his craftsman's attire.
He handed Huang a small wooden box, within which were the prototype plans his father had revised in his later years. He also took out a bow and said: "As the issue arose from Blackcliff, so too shall it end by Blackcliff. It is said that the house of Yun appreciates archery. Should it please you, give this bow a try."
Huang fired an arrow into the sky. It roared across the heavens like angry thunder, as the sound of the bowstring being released reverberated throughout the mountains. As she watched the clouds flow beneath the moon, she knew that her prayer had been answered.

Description[]
The Millelith Soldier are renowned the world over for their skilled use of polearm weapons.
The signature white-tasseled halberd they wield is mass-produced at the Blackcliff Forge.
It is a weapon that has stood the test of countless bloody battles over centuries of history.
For even when the smoke of the battlefield stained the tassel a murky shade of gray, it would wave proudly and defiantly like a flag in the wind.
The army once had in its ranks a legendary master of the polearm.
He could hit his target from miles away without staining its tassel.
"The legend is that of the polearm's bearer..."
"Not the polearm itself, which was entirely ordinary."
The old smith smacked his apprentice.
He demanded a white tassel for the newly made polearm.

Description[]
The "pearl and waves" emblem of the Sangonomiya is said to represent the waves that embrace Watatsumi,
And the bright pearls that can be found there. But some also say that it shows the jeweled wheel of Watatsumi Omikami keeping eternal vigil over the land of coral like the moon.
In the dreams of the deep sea where sponges and coral dwell, in the depths where flowing clouds and ocean sands dance as one,
Undying hope would pass from generation to generation of those descended from their god — they who dreamed the same dreams as Watatsumi.
The colors of the skies are ever-changing, and the lights and shadows cast deep beneath the waves are of forms ill-defined...
Thus did the brilliant compassion that the dark ocean could not conceal diffuse in tranquil bliss.
In those days, the first Divine Priestess once led her brethren with wisdom as precious as pearls,
And she selected clergy from amongst the people newly introduced to the sun, who aided the offspring of their god in comforting those for whom the light of day brought terror.
In latter days, the "Umigozen" who made the navies of Narukami tremble would sing whale-songs alongside them,
And it was this symbol that they drew as they danced with the airborne kurage.
Some years later, a single bolt of lightning would reject the dream of the Watatsumi people.
Into the storm slithered the serpent, the lightning's ruthless glow to surely face...
But the children of the god and the shrine maidens, who had hearts of pearl, would not forget.
Countless tales, gratitude unnumbered, and that ring of ocean gems would forever be passed down,
And they would shine ever brighter and more beautifully for it.
Whether it be the histories of the jeweled branches being torn or the birth of precious pearls,
Or the defeat of the wicked creatures in the depths to bring sunlight to the pale nation beneath the waves,
Or how the young man who dreamed of standing atop Mt. Yougou came to have the name of an "evil king," and had his great duel against the tengu...
All these would light up the hearts of the children of Watatsumi, like pearls from the heavens, like waves under the moon's glow.
They will carry the pain of loss away into the churning, salty waters, storing them within radiant pearls.
May the stories and sacrifices of the age of gods forever be handed down, along with this emblem of "pearl and waves."
Even if the storm clouds should gather, and even if the violet lightning's ferocity be perilous and unpredictable,
The silver moon of Watatsumi shall still pierce through the clouds and scatter forth its light.

Description[]
Leap, the master swordsman Skyrider did, from the heights of Jueyun Karst.
He pierced the clouds as the winds hollered by his ears,
But what followed was the sound of shattering.
What he had hoped for was something swordsmanship could not bring him.
He pawned the sword for medicine,
But die it did not, his dream of flight.

Gameplay Notes[]
The passive cannot be activated on hits that deal no DMG, even if they score a CRIT Hit.
The passive has a chance to activate for each hit that deals damage to an enemy as well as for each enemy hit while the character is on the field. Therefore:
Multi-hit skills such as Diona's Icy Paws (5 hits) are more likely to activate the passive.
Skills that deal AoE damage such as Venti's Skyward Sonnet are more likely to activate the passive if the skill hits multiple enemies.
If the character equipped with the weapon is not on the field when they deal critical damage, the passive will not activate.
In Co-Op Mode, triggering the passive generates elemental particles for all members of the team.
Description[]
A spear of honor amongst the Knights of Favonius. It is used in a ceremonial role at parades and reviews, but it is also a keen and mortal foe of monsters.
By studying the arbor that held firm in the wind, the craftsmen and scholars of Mondstadt would learn much of elemental affinities.
This sturdy spear not only holds a place of special honor among the Knights — it is also a crystallization of the hard work and artistry of the city's defenders.
With it in hand, they shall always remember to be disciplined, and to defend Mondstadt's freedom.
Indeed, many people have used polearms of a kind as their weapons, using the reach advantage to supplement their lack of martial skill.
Even untrained plebeians could arm themselves with sharpened wooden sticks, and they would perhaps be a match for the steel of trained soldiers.
To celebrate the overthrow of the aristocracy, long stakes, flagpoles and pitchforks were stuck all over the greenery around the city.
It was once required of all nobles to study the art of the sword, that they might grow in stature and wisdom.
In those days, the art of the spear was reserved for foreign gladiators and traitors.
But there was once a noble scion who wielded a spear.
They said that Eberhart would enjoy the night breeze as he caught the first drops of dew with his spear tip.
An illegitimate child, Eberhart dreamed of recapturing the glory and pride of ancient nobility.
Yet, he needed greater power in order to destroy these rotten foundations. So—
Whether it was instigate his legitimate brother to pursue his dream of becoming a phantom thief, before deceiving him and forcing him to flee,
So that he might usurp that legitimacy,
Or whether it was pledging himself as a certain spear-wielding witch's disciple to learn the fatal loophole in her art,
All the better to slay her with...
"So what if those who came after should despise me? I will do anything to achieve my goals."

Description[]
This version of the Magic Guide generated much controversy when published.
In addition to the defiance of basic common sense seen in Chapter VII: Principles of the Anemo Element,
errors can also be observed even concerning the basic principles of the Hydro and Electro elements.
Evidently, the book was not peer-reviewed before publishing. Nevertheless, the book is still the most authoritative guide to magic in existence.

Description[]
For reasons known to all and sundry, the script of "Clockwork Coppelia" has never been publicized or published. Of the survivors of that splendorous opera theater that day, some wrote down their memories of the parts and lines that were performed prior to the intermission.
After obtaining consent from the family of the deceased Mr. Coppelius and the aforementioned parties, our company has collated and organized the relevant materials in an attempt to recreate a part of Mr. Coppelius's original work.
Though perhaps it is merely speculation and misses the mark, we hope that our effort will get the ball rolling and attract more sophisticated efforts.
Synopsis: How Coppelius's plan was exposed before the Marechaussee Hunters, and how he said his final farewells to Coppelia before his punishment.
Coppelius: Sing for me, my Coppelia, my love, my sin, my soul! Sing for me, one last time!
Coppelius: Wind a thread about my heart, and with it, bind me tightly! Lock me up in chains and fetters, and let me be destroyed in your eyes.
Coppelius: For mine heart is decided, from today forth, I shall not seek those that make me happy, but bring happiness to those I choose.
Coppelius: Even if you must mock all that I am, that does not make a mockery of my thoughts, but only of my foolish conduct.
Coppelia: How would you have me sing? My beloved one, how would you have me sing of this sin and its inevitable punishment?
Coppelia: All are content with fantastical, colorful facade, just as those of flesh and blood pursue gilded fruit, totally unaware of the lethal poison hidden within.
Coppelia: Coppelius, my Coppelius, everything you pursue is as hollow as stage scenery, leaving not even a puff of smoke, for temptation will end the journey — this, every intelligent person understands.
Synopsis: Coppelia confesses the purpose of her journey to the youth traveling with her, and resolves to follow her creator, who in her eyes, has already passed on.
Nathaniel: This is completely absurd, yet also absurdly commonplace. The wise always take orders from fools, and life is but a vulgar comedy.
Coppelia: Precisely so, sir, so you needn't worry on my account. Soon, all of this terrible suffering shall be completely obliterated.
Coppelia: The one who created me and gave me life has already bid an eternal farewell to this mortal coil, and when these rusted gears return to the same ash as his bones, all sin will be forgotten, and for flesh and blood, to be forgotten is to be forgiven.
Coppelia: Never again need I see the sun, moon, or stars, never again need I hear the birds singing joyously in the forests, never again need I force this lonely heart of mine to continue beating on in a world that is already bereft of he who bestowed it upon me.
Nathaniel: What do you plan to do?
Coppelia: This heart of mine, which beats as though it were ensconced in a vessel of flesh and blood, has already been stained with the same sin on this journey. This heart of mine, so tortured by the pain of regret — where could it ever hope to find peace?

Description[]
A jade piece which, despite its exquisite packaging, has been placed in one of the least prominent positions in the store.
The box comes with an official-looking certificate of premium quality, issued by an organization that no one has ever heard of.
To the untrained eye, the luxurious packaging and accessories would probably be enough to lure one in.
However, it is still reasonable value for money when compared with genuine top-quality jade pieces.

Description[]
In the era when the desert king ruled the lands, authority covered the realm like sunlight over the rolling dunes.
The surviving songs of the nomads are like the chirping of desert insects, forever singing of the glory of that forgotten golden age.
The red lord, they say, once contended against the bright sun, and ultimately fell to the earth like a meteorite.
There are those amongst the priests, they say, who were not slain by the kings and princes who followed, who pass down King Deshret's art of archery...
The descendants of the priests call themselves the "Heirs of the Burning Sun," and practice the ceremonies of King Deshret's kingdom from days past without ceasing.
Even the travelling merchants and their information networks know precious little about these mysterious cabals.
Few among the gilded descendants of the desert have the right to inherit the legacy of King Deshret's priests, and few can still read the ancient texts,
Much less the graceful combat arts that the ancient priests had mastered: cudgel, spear, and that of which they were most proud, archery.
The Eremites name these people "ascetics," and some have now turned their loyalty to the only surviving God King of Sumeru.
But most disappeared into the boundless desert, hiding among the snakes, scorpions, and specters of the ancient kingdom.
Those loyal to the rainforest retain the customs of being hidden and silent, using their strength to repay the ancient favor,
Yet in their heart of hearts, they deeply mourn their ancestors and His Majesty, King Deshret, who met with disaster millennia before.
In this way, the elegant and ancient art and ceremony of archery has been passed down till today by the descendants of the priests.
Though the meaning of many ancient texts and pictures have long been lost or have succumbed to error,
And though the mighty figure of the red lord nocking an arrow to his bow has become only a shattered dream of the distant past...
The fragile embers of that ancient nation have not yet been extinguished, but have become an even more deeply concealed element,
Passing on their inherited knowledge of the ancient days, protecting civilization today.
And among those "ascetics" who disappeared into the desert, some strayed from the path of the priest.
They became obsessed with fleeting mirages of authority, attempting to meddle with and mold the nomadic tribes.
Using the strict ceremonies of the ancient past, they trained lost children as "Falcons."
The advanced techniques honed from generation to generation to cultivate noble warriors have today taken a decidedly different path.
To assist in the birth of a new "king," they trained completely mindless Falcons and dogs...
But that is another tale for another time, for those with great ambition often disappear into the vast desert,
Without a sound, like bitter tears falling into the infinite and endless ocean.

Description[]
"This is the mark of our pledge, and it is also my challenge to you."
"All my wisdom is hidden within this stone dumbbell."
He remembers meeting the young woman with the billowing sleeves, remembers the way she acted solemn, yet seemed joyful when she presented him this token.
What a silly notion. There was no formal contract between them. They were merely two people walking the same path for their own reasons...
But he remembers the scene of their first meeting anyway, when the Glaze Lilies were still in abundant bloom.
He also remembers those words she spoke at the end — again, amid the Glaze Lilies.
"Those little people are as small and fragile as dust."
"Because they are so small, they know not when they will lose their lives to disaster or strife, and so they are afraid."
"Because they are afraid, they try so hard to become more intelligent. This I understand."
"So I thought that since there is such a gulf between us in strength, I should use technique and wisdom instead."
"With your brawn and my brains, this city would surely become a great one."
Her final smile was a lonely one, even as her form dissolved into the finest dust.
"It seems that our journey together has come to an end. As for that stone dumbbell, forget about it, would you?"
"This is the mark of our pledge, and it is also my challenge to you."
"All my wisdom is hidden within this stone dumbbell."
"If you can unlock it—"
Many years passed, and he was never able to unlock that dumbbell, nor would he ever learn what might have followed that sentence.
Over the years, the wild Glaze Lilies, too, dwindled till at last they were no more.
Lore[]
This catalyst was originally forged by Guizhong in Liyue through unknown methods. It was given as a gift to Morax by Guizhong, and presumably remains in his possession to the current day.

Trivia[]
The description is about Guizhong and Morax (Zhongli), the two gods who dwelled over Guili Plains, and their first and final meeting.
The weapon's design is based on a Burr puzzle, also known as the Kongming/Luban lock (Chinese: 孔明锁/鲁班锁). The weapon's Chinese name is Mortal World's Lock (Chinese: 尘世之锁 Chénshìzhīsuǒ), and the stone "dumbbell" is called a lock in Chinese.

Description[]
The whole world flocks to the commercial port of Liyue, much to the city's pride.
With the tides of people also come exotic treasures.
This map, detailing the various seas surrounding the continent, is complete with undercurrents, hidden reefs, and wind directions.
It is said to be an exotic tome containing the knowledge, courage, and faith of pioneering explorers.
The title page of this book reads as follows:
"Love ye the sea breeze and the ocean currents, for it is the wind and water that carry the seafaring ones to their destination."
"Fear ye all the more that same sea breeze and those same ocean currents, for unbridled wind and water can tear apart even an iron vessel."
To woo the ocean and calm her temper, one must explore her every hidden reef, every prevailing wind, and every place which whales make their home.
These words appear in the yellowing pages of countless seafarers' notebooks, like an ode of infatuation with their lover's body.
In foreign lands, seasoned sailors refer to the ocean as their lover, and use female pronouns to address the cold, saline waters.
Perhaps they do so because of the ocean's temperamentality, or its vast bosom. Or perhaps it is because they are drawn to the romance of sailing away on an adventure.
Like the ocean, this chart answers to no master. Like the seafarers, it harbors the romantic dream of exploring every corner of the world.

Description[]
Where once there were dances before the throne, the sounds of the bells still linger.
The white silhouette, once something to pursue, never returned, yet it remains an unceasing dream from which one cannot wake...
"I was a silly little thing back then, nowhere near as intelligent as our great matriarch Hakushin."
"Groping about clumsily, I was a whelp foraging through the snow, hoping to draw Her Excellency's attention."
"Funnily enough, it was exactly because of my foolhardy courage that Her Excellency had pity on me."
"And that's how I came into her service. You know, warming her hands and feet and all. Very great honor."
"Lady Saiguu would later depart, never to return, and those seniors of mine would also be lost due to various other reasons."
"And that was how someone as bumbling as I took up the role of "Miko" and grew into the person you know today."
"Thus it was in this way that the unfortunate task of putting a smile on Her Excellency's face fell squarely on my shoulders."
"The night when I first performed the Kagura dance, I felt the weight of the 'past.'"
The tinkling of the bells grew distant, and the great silver kitsune, master and friend, disappeared into the winding river of dreams.
The bells sounded again, and the obstinate sandbar loosened and dissolved into the swirling current.
The pure white, gentle figure of the past had long drifted into dark memory.
So the lone daughter of the great kitsune lineage would take up the Kagura bells, and dance for the vibrant "now."
I knew a young and obstinate tengu warrior, and used the pretext of "training" to bluff her into asceticism in the mountains,
But sensing her unruly nature, I recommended her to those block-headed Kujou.
And though I once had a competition against an obstinate oni and was defeated by dint of sheer perseverance...
I did add a few little tricks to make our contest more interesting.
I corresponded with a half-adeptus from a distant land, and gifted her fresh and supple ocean plants.
Still, I felt keenly that I could not understand her almost foolish love. Is that not a form of bondage for the adepti?
The moonlight sweeps across the imperial garden through branch and petal, alighting upon the empty courtyard.
That scene still glows brightly in my shallow heart like countless glimmering jewels...
"In the short span of these few hundred years, I have walked the earth in many guises."
"Though I have not had the fortune to have deep relationships with ordinary people, I came to know human beauty deeply."
"And Her Excellency, whom I might dare to call friend, should have more time yet to roam this world."
"So let us see this imperfect world together and enjoy its obsessions with love and hate, with meetings and partings."
With Her Excellency engrossed in her dream-real of Eternity, someone needed to look out for the common folk.
To quell the resentment of the wicked oni Kuroami, I once showed but a hint of the ominous power I wield.
And the great disturbance caused by Kosanta the Bald Tanuki would be made sport of with a little application of magic.
The marauding pirate Rinzou, terror of the archipelago, would also be betrayed over some small discordance in plans.
And as for that blank slate, that immortal eccentric...
I hope "he" will find his way and not become a threat to us all.
The darkened remains of the swordmaster's soul, the beasts of catastrophe hiding in the sacred forest, they were all wiped out...
Compared to the dream of Eternity Her Excellency pursues, such things were but fleeting interludes,
And the wait for her to come around seemed to stretch out infinitely, but I knew that time was on our side.
"I mean, a Euthymia without wind or moon, with lotuses and udumbara that do not wither,"
"I'm sorry, but the loneliness would get to me. I'd be bored to tears."
"I'd much rather snap off Thunder Sakura branches in a drunken haze and cavort with the impudent youkai."
"And no, these are not stories of the ancient past, but of a future full of hope."
"So, You [sic] Excellency, might I still have the pleasure of joining you to watch the first pale purple buds that emerge when the snow next melts?"

Lore[]
This item was supposed to be a product sample of a pre-order special for the final volume of King of Invokations #1.
However, due to its unique specifications, the request to produce a sample was misunderstood as one to craft an actual weapon.
As such, the editors of Yae Publishing House were frustrated at what transpired upon receiving this bow. Yet Fukumoto, who was present when the bow was delivered, was deeply inspired by this turn of events and wrote the following excerpt, which would later be included in the book as an appendix.
"The one who wields this bow, shall be the most adept archer under the command of the King of the Great Red Sand."
It is as everyone said, and a belief that the prussian green-skinned young man held strongly. When the Ibis King displayed his trove of treasures, this bejeweled sandstone-hued longbow caught his eye immediately. It was a time when the young man had yet to be poisoned by destiny, a time when he still believed that all that he desired were accolades to be won—
To him, it was a mere matter of how much effort one had to devote.
Thus, he posed a question to the Ibis King with an easy confidence, "If I become the most brilliant archer of all, if I possess power and strength surpassing that of the other kings, would this longbow be mine?"
Silence fell over the court. In the shadows yet to be illuminated by the lamps, no one dared to answer.
There was only one exception: the man atop the throne with eyes as sharp as a falcon's chuckled, and granted the young man's wish.
"The day is bound to come," the green-skinned youth thought.
Be that as it may, long, arduous years have passed since.
It was several hundred years later when the lord of war fulfilled his wish. Possessing the young man who opened the Casket of Tomes, he entered the sealed "Room of Duels" again, and only then did he see the longbow held by the phantom.
It was as if time stood still, so that the remnant of his soul could pass through the shattered doors and scattered corridors, and return to the chamber of treachery and machinations. Grasping the inescapable golden arrow fired off by the Bow of Secret Rites that was zipping towards him, he saved the body from an unfortunate fate of being impaled through the chest.
That had always been part of his plan.
But at this moment, the secret ritual dissipated. The arrow was dispelled and the silhouette of the bow-wielder vanished in a flash.
He grabbed the longbow before it clattered to the ground.
His multiple attempts at seizing this gold-forged bow had ended in failure, which contributed to the rift between him and the Ibis King. Alas, when he finally acquired the treasure that he had long coveted, he found that his heart was as cold as a stagnant swamp, with nary a ripple of joy. The Crocodile King pondered, and concluded that he no longer had such a great yearning to satisfy those unfulfilled desires as he did in his youth.
Moreover, the revered Lord of the Scarlet Sands had been hidden in many histories, and the Mistress of Flowers had never been seen again. In vying for the mausoleum's throne, strife and chaos broke out amongst the kingdoms. Amidst the turmoil, he took the opportunity to trample the sea of sands in the name of the "Rite of Duels," all to erase the barriers between multitude of worlds and thus incite a frenzied war. To stop him, a lone, elderly figure clutching onto the golden bow, trudged up the steps leading to the ritual...
Those were but memories of a bygone era.
He ran his fingers over the orb on the bow, until it dawned on him that it wasn't dust that was dimming its glow, let alone the fact that this dust was a mere figment of his imagination.
"Never mind," the lord of war thought.
He heard the sound of the table being activated again in the "Room of Duels", and guessed that the young man whose his remnant soul had once possessed was eagerly waiting for a duel.
And thus he strapped his longbow to his side, painting a picture of victory he had once dreamed of.
The prussian green-skinned king slowly paced towards the battlefield decreed by fate.

Gameplay Notes[]
Press the Advantage requires the character equipped with the weapon to be on the field and also to be the one that deals the fatal blow.
Description[]
A broadsword wrought from rare blackcliff. Weighty as a boulder, it has enough brute force to carve its way through a mountain.
The blade is forged from a combination of blackcliff crystal and a crimson ore. It is pitch black like a pool of ink, with red flames leaping from within.
Blackcliff weaponry has its roots in the ancient "prototype" series. Blackcliff blades possess three distinguishing features: hard as bedrock, shimmer like ice, fierce as the blood that gives us life.
Though the Slasher is a broadsword, it has a uniquely sharp blade, barely thicker than a thread of silk.
The join between the red and black crystals is seamless, and each blade segment interlocks perfectly with the next to form a single cohesive body.
With the flame motif and red jade stones that adorn the hilt, the sword has a dark and foreboding presence when viewed from afar, like bright-red blood oozing from a bottomless pit of black ink.
Master craftsman Han Wu once embarked on a quest to find the finest ore with which to cast a blackcliff blade. He searched everywhere, until he became involved in a mining accident.
While trapped in the cave, his eyes perceived nothing but an all-engulfing and profoundly disorienting darkness. His ears rang with the thunderous crashing of rocks, as if the foundations of the world itself were caving in.
In the aftermath of this ordeal, the craftsman's furnace lay unused. Where flames had once burned bright, frigid dust now gathered as the forgotten fantasies of the forge dwindled and died.
Han Wu's son, Han Ce, read that the earth's core had been sealed off due to a monster infestation, and rushed to inform his father.
Han Wu was racked with guilt upon hearing the news. He was certain that it was his trip into the mine that had disturbed the dragon from underground and the meteorite from the heavens.
He forced himself up from his sickbed, lit the fires of the furnace once more and forged a mighty broadsword.
When it was ready, Han Ce took the sword into the mine shaft.
There, on instructions from his father, he erected a shrine as tall as himself and placed the sword inside to ward off evil and rebuke the dragon.
Han Wu died peacefully in his sleep several years later.
At the moment of Han Wu's death, a traveler passing by the mine shaft at Mt. Tianheng saw a crimson light shining out from somewhere within the rocks. As the traveler watched on, a hidden shrine appeared and slowly opened.
The broadsword inside the shrine shone faintly, as if weeping with bereavement.
Han Ce went into the mountains that very night to retrieve the blade.
The Tianshu of that age personally engraved an inscription upon the blade:
"Carves open mountains and tears through the seas, shreds apart clouds and splits the moon."

Refining Fading Twilight requires Glowing Gem instead of an identical weapon. 4 Glowing Gems can be obtained through Perilous Trail's event's challenges.
Description[]
A jade-colored longbow that is said to be able to shoot down even the twilit clouds over the horizon. Upon it is inlaid a precious bead.
Buried in the depths, it has long been drenched in darkness, yet its luster endures, ever shining and glowing.
In times long past, when a dark calamity befell the vermillion valley, countless Millelith soldiers sallied forth, heroism in their hearts.
Among all these valiant figures was a young archer who came from the mountains, and who would eventually remain in the depths, never to leave.
"I am the daughter of the cliffs of Glazed Sand Crystal. My blood knows no fear."
"With so many Millelith willingly heading towards their doom in battle, it would be shameful for us mountain people to just stand by and watch."
"It may be natural that a cataclysm that we have not yet seen with our own eyes remains a foreign and abstract concept to us."
"Yet now that it stands before us, how could we do anything other than hold the line and do our duty..."
The stubborn young woman stole the bow that belonged to her father, the tribal chief, by night, before following the Millelith as they sallied out.
As she steeled herself to never again see the light of day, the gem on the bow gleamed.
"The dark bats she felled with every shot, the giant tortoise of the dark ooze, she nailed to the ground."
"The magnificent bow danced like the clouds themselves, its arrows' cold gleam tearing through blighted beast-flesh."
"No deluge of filth from the abyss, nor twisted demon from the warped depths..."
"No incomprehensible terror could make her heart quail, or force her to retreat."
The people of the mountains would sing songs in praise of their daughter, though she of whom the songs spoke would never again return to them.
These tunes would change and shift with the passage of time like dawn's glow even to this day, yet she who owned the bow would never come back.
"The only thing I truly fear is to be lost and forgotten."
"Should ill fate dictate that I am to be buried in some nameless place, do not forget me."

Description[]
"We shall remember this oath of the thousand years, and defend the foundation of the capital of water."
"Never forget the shackles of sin that were once tempting as honey,"
"And never forget our heavy responsibilities that may now seem like fetters."
"They represent the deity's honey-sweet grace and faith in us."
"We are the shield that guards against the disaster of the flood, and the line of defense against the breach."
The first watcher always led the new recruits to recite their oath.
Indeed, no one would wish for such a life, but everything comes with a price.
We once succumbed to the euphoria of violence, or were driven by greed.
This vow is the recompense of justice, as well as the final chance at redemption.
Neither sunlight nor family are present here, so we must find a semblance of joy.
Although the watcher sometimes wondered if the sinners took these vows on their own accord,
Or merely uttered syllables that meant nothing to them,
He still sincerely hoped that the wild joy he experienced when the deity entrusted this heavy responsibility to him,
Would light up the path of these "brothers and sisters" of his, and give meaning to their lives,
Just as it had lit up his hopeless and dreary future.
The teachings of the watchers would thus be passed from generation to generation, flowing down like an endless stream.
For if the harbinger of the apocalypse would indeed one day arrive, the flood would wash everything away.
The watchers would fight with both duty and joy in their our hearts, just as the goddess had found empathy for them in hers.
My duty is now complete, so I shall leave the goddess' grace and duty to you all.
The first watcher was buried between mineral veins of extraordinary splendor,
Because it is the place most filled with light. The man who had lived for many years in the shadows
Held the light he once saw in his heart as he quietly slumbered beneath the soil by the breach.
The flood that would wash everything away is never unleashed,
As fate is often loath to grant would-be heroes an honorable death.
Even so, an inaudible trickle began to silently corrode the priory as if a thief shrouded in the shadows.
Those forced to join the order and live underwater gradually increased in number,
Yet those who swore the oath, understood its meaning, and knew the teachings only declined over time.
Many long years later, a grand and ominous fortress would rise from the seabed,
But as for the last brother who called himself a watcher and shouldered the expectations of a god,
The location of his grave would become known to none.
Still, perhaps this place can still be called fortunate,
As the other suppressed breach was eventually discovered many years later by one who set out to reveal its secrets.

Description[]
The Knight of Boreas' journey ended at the city of Barbatos.
Wandering souls attract each other, boundless freedom begets only anxiety.
Upon entering the city, the Knight of Boreas' companion bade him farewell in silence.
For the free-spirited Wolf resented the stone walls and lamplight, and yearned for the open wilds.
The Knight of Boreas' heart remained free, though his flesh was inside the prison-like city.
Meanwhile, the windborne Wolf roamed the forest in the flesh, while his heart remained loyal to the Knight.
The Knight of Boreas rode again to hunt. The Wolf followed his scent into battle.
Still one were they, the Wolf and the Knight.
Though one they were, death comes for beasts sooner than men.
Laying down his sword as a gravestone, the Knight of Boreas buried the Wolf in the remote countryside.
The Knight of Boreas then left the city behind, living instead the wandering life of a lone wolf.
Yet the eternal wolf spirit remained here,
Watching over the land the Knight once protected.

Description[]
In the glorious past, the pure white ironclad flagship "Sponsian" was the pride of Fontaine's Navy.
In that age, the metal-armored warships armed with heavy cannons and sturdy prows for ramming were the darlings of the Court of Fontaine.
In the age of the splendor of the opera house, none in the audience failed to give the white armada a standing ovation when it swept the golem legion aside.
Before her retirement, the proud Admiral Basil Elton could always be seen upon the Sponsian's bridge.
Elton's First Mate, Nathaniel Pickman, lost his place in the end, and spent the rest of his days trapped by a false heroic reputation.
At this time, the Navy had been completely disbanded due to the armada ceasing to exist forevermore. The once renowned Minister of the Navy had resigned with honors.
Pickman busied himself for many years attempting to persuade the Court of Fontaine to salvage and rebuild the "Sponsian."
But his efforts were in vain, and the families of the fallen believed his efforts to rebuild the Fontainian Navy were little more than an attempt to fish for more glory...
In the end, the only thing remaining besides falsehoods and legends was this blue and white epee that once belonged to the Admiral.
"The 'Sponsian'? Awful name. What were you thinking, Pickman?"
"The name of a usurper? Why, he and his dynasty may never have even existed—"
"Anyway... I was just thinking aloud, y'know, and it just slipped out. Apologies, Captain."
"Relax, Pickman. You know what? Let's just call it that."
"That sense of unreal reality, I don't hate it."
Many legends regarding the "Sponsian" and "White Armada" remained popular for some time after the destruction of the splendorous opera house,
And they were staged at the newly-rebuilt [sic] opera house on Erinnyes to great success, until an accident put paid to such performances.
Of them, the most memorable performance is the final battle of the armada: A heroic battle with a formidable barrage performed by ten battleship cannons onstage,
With the details having been reconstructed from the records of Basil Elton's First Mate.
Perhaps Pickman did not think that absurd action worth writing down, just as he never once discussed it,
Or perhaps the writers removed that detail from the script, feeling that it detracted from the intended epic tragedy,
But Basil Elton boarded the flagship once more after several years away, and muttered to Pickman and the other sailors:
"Looks like this time we can finally open fire on our enemies."
It was only after that she smiled and called out, as performed in the opera house:
"Well now, boys and girls! Can't do without me, I see! But if you wanna get nostalgic over tea, it'll have to wait!"
"First, let's send that oversized punk who doesn't know what's what back down to the bottom of the waterfall!"

Description[]
In old Mondstadt, spear arts were forbidden by the nobility.
Ostensibly, they claimed that only the sword was worthy of noble stock,
But they say that in reality, it was because the length of polearms could bridge the gaps in training,
Which might grant the unarmed and unschooled commoners a weapon with which to resist.

Musou Isshin
Type
WeaponsLore
Region
Inazuma
The Musou Isshin (Japanese: 夢想の一心 Musou no Isshin) is a legendary sword that was originally created from Makoto's divine might. While it was in Makoto's possession, the blade was kept unsharpened and unused, and was used as a symbol of true peace. After her death during the cataclysm 500 years ago, she left a faint fragment of her will in it[1] and passed it on to her sister Ei, who began to use it as a weapon in battle.[2]
After creating the Shogun, Ei transferred her consciousness into the Musou Isshin and created the Plane of Euthymia, while the sword itself is kept within the Shogun and summoned from her heart.
Ever since the Musou Isshin was passed down, Ei and the Shogun have performed the Musou no Hitotachi with this blade. After Ei had a change of heart and released the full power of the Musou Isshin, Makoto's will was released from it.
The Raiden Shogun's Elemental Burst, Secret Art: Musou Shinsetsu, changes her stance from wielding a Polearm to wielding the Musou Isshin (which uses Sword animations).

Trivia[]
While romanized the same way, the Musou here (夢想 "Dream") is different from the Musou in Musou no Hitotachi (無想 "blank mind; a state where one is free from all thoughts and desires").
In the Chinese and Japanese descriptions for Secret Art: Musou Shinsetsu, "Musou no Hitotachi" is written using the characters for "dream" rather than the ones for "blank mind." The description points this out, saying that the Raiden Shogun has abandoned "the void-like 'Musou,' [and] she now shoulders a new 'Musou' — the dreams and ambitions of all."
The Musou Isshin is a tachi, a Japanese sword used by samurai, albeit with a slightly longer hilt and blade than the more famous katana.[3]

Description[]
This bow once belonged to a certain hunter, and its green color was such that it could blend in with the natural environment.
To be as pure as the beasts of the verdant fields, who roam in the forests in the light of day.
To never bear any ill-will, and to never loose an arrow for any reason but to survive.
The nameless hunter was taught thus, and grew thus, far away from the city.
"We were born of the greenery. As long as there is grass and shade, we shall move unimpeded."
"We are the same as beast and bird. As long as we follow the laws of nature, then we shall not fear death."
"All those who follow nature, when their life reaches its last ebb, shall head towards that endless plain."
Following these precepts, the hunter left no traces, and fought not against the natural order.
She comforted the wild beasts that had been shot through the heart, until their lives had returned to nature.
If that calamity had not happened, if she had not tracked the tainted blood upon the leaves,
If she had not met that dying, blind youth under the tree where she often napped,
Then perhaps she may never have been shaken by thoughts of revenge, by blood and fire...
"Never forget, good Viridescent."
"Never forget that you belong to the green, child of the forest."
"Never loose your arrow for war, for revenge, or for glory."
"For the bloodstained shall never find yonder hunting fields of endless viridescence."
"Then at least do not let this bow be tainted by my mortal vengeance."
"I cannot reach the other side, whether to meet my master or the parents whom I have never met."
"But at least let this bow remain pure, and let it carry my thoughts and regrets to them."

Description[]
First, the sun and the moons were created, and thus day and night came to be. She once described the night sky adorned with three bright moons to me in a language I have now forgotten — yes, the number of moons should be three.
May the shadows of the world cast their pearly shimmer upon the earth when they awake, such that people can follow the silver-plated outline of the dunes at night to find their final fate.
Next, weight was created. Thus sand sank, forming the earth. And that which was without weight became the sky. I stipulated that one should rely on the earth, but dream of the sky.
The weight should not be excessive, or the land will bind people's feet, impede those longing to travel far, and hinder expansion through exploration, while causing people to be unable to fly high, unable to explore the future.
Then the seven sage monks were established again, and they ruled the trajectories drawn by the earth, water, and stars. Even if the celestial sphere was just an illusion, myths are often born when people look up at the stars and moons.
In the original world, the barriers were torn down, and the dark poison had penetrated the earth. To heal that fragile, sad, and imperfect world, the spikes descended and pierced through the earth's crust.
However, the rules I have set are more elegant and precise, so there is no need and there should be no followers of hers who shall die meaninglessly on their account, and no poetry should be lost for their sake.
Next, the beastly trail from the poison should be cut off, for taking poison is a sin running deeper than the sky. But how sweet the whispers can be, and how clear the wisdom of which they speak...
The wind arises in the new world. The pearly moonlight, the amber afterglow, the waves of grass, and the roots of the waters have gradually ceased to be silent, all singing the poems that she left behind.
The cycle of seven must be removed, because the secret narrative will be blocked.
Fear and grief must be torn down, and so the barrier between life and death must be removed.
Remove the sun, the moons, and weight, for there should be no barriers between time and space.
Remove the original principles of rules, verdicts, and grace, so that she will no longer be afraid of the punishment that is laid on her kin.
Remove birds, beasts, fish, dragons, humans, and seven monk-kings, so that none shall steal wisdom.
"The Sand King sleeps alone in secret dreams, drawing up new theorems."
"None shall have to drink salt water in the King's realm, for everything in the new world shall be good."
This is how perfection can be achieved. I can see the three of us debating in our paradise once more. We are so close.
Yes, this is splendid. I understand now. This is what I have always wanted. That which I have always longed to find once more has never been a paradise for the many.
All the parodies of the teachings and the seven wise monks, or that so-called pure world free of all sorrows, none of those things matter anymore...
But I do not wish that the poison ingested by mistake should remain in this world. Perhaps she might, in light of our old friendship...
— Even if she will not do it for my sake, that is also fine. I only ask that she do me one last favor for the sake of our mutual friend...
Lore[]
The description for Staff of the Scarlet Sands is narrated by King Deshret, who created this staff alongside the Key of Khaj-Nisut as the keys to the Orchard of Pairidaeza, the "eternal oasis" created as Nabu Malikata's resting place.
Deshret begins with a story he learned from Nabu Malikata, of the Heavenly Principles's creation of the world and of the three moon sisters, Aria, Sonnet and Canon. This world was destroyed after forbidden knowledge (the "dark poison") was introduced to Teyvat, by Dragon King Nibelung during his attempt to take the world back from the usurper.[1] This event also saw the arrival of other outworlders,[2] including the Second Who Came[3] ("the barriers were torn down").
By the end of the war, the Heavenly Principles suppressed forbidden knowledge with the divine nails (the "spikes")[1] and, no longer able to suppress the original world due to the injuries it sustained during the war, created a new order.[4] The three moon sisters perished, with only one of their corpses remaining.[5] The Seelie were punished with exile and many were stripped of their intellect, becoming reduced to their wispy present-day forms.[6][7] Nabu Malikata was an exiled Seelie[8] who retained her intellect, but was cursed to never look again at the heavens.[2] As a result, Deshret's ideal world involved removing the "original principles" so "she [would] no longer be afraid of the punishment that is laid on her kin."
Despite knowing the dangers of forbidden knowledge and the Heavenly Principles' fear of it[2] ("for taking poison is a sin running deeper than the sky"), Deshret was enthralled by its potential as he grew increasingly obsessed with creating his ideal world and subverting the Heavenly Principles. Nabu Malikata supported him and ultimately sacrificed herself to help realize his ambition,[9] but Greater Lord Rukkhadevata — who had, for a time, joined the two at Ay-Khanoum ("our paradise") — disagreed with their ideals and returned to Dharma Forest.[10] When the forbidden knowledge Deshret consumed unintentionally spread to his civilization and caused widespread plagues, he hoped Rukkhadevata would lend her assistance in suppressing it ("Perhaps she might, in light of our old friendship... [...] I only ask that she do me one last favor for the sake of our mutual friend..."). She did, even consuming so much power in the process that her form turned into a child's.[11]

Description[]
The splendid jadeite fell from the sky, washed by the ever-flowing cleansing waters.
Freed from dark earth and rotten wood, every trace of residue removed.
A primordial stone, chiseled and molded by the hands of mortal youth.
Ultimately becoming a splendid jade instrument, awaiting a serendipitous moment to fulfill its sacred purpose...
"It is just as I said," mused the researcher from the realm of rainforests over tea, "the arc of history bends towards decay and collapse."
"The fall of humanity can only be prevented with the wisdom and mercy of the gods. Without these, humans will inevitably annihilate themselves."
"Witness the silent testimony of the deserted ruins lying betwixt mountain and swamp. Witness the wild beasts in the hills, bereft of their powers of speech and spirit..."
"The people of the past perished without a trace, and even their greatest kings and chiefs failed to make even a ripple."
The people of Chenyu Vale did not always dwell there, but once called the crystal-veined mountains home.
Life of family and tribe both revolved around the mines, and their settlements stretched from peak to peak.
But the ancient sin lying buried beneath their feet and shovels was unknown to the mortals, hidden under the deepest shafts.
Divine punishment is unforgiving, and cares not for the lives of mortals. After the catastrophe, their forebears were forced to bring their families northward.
The elders of Qiaoying Village claim that the ancestors of the people of Chenyu Vale came from a chasm to the south.
They brought with them a great jade altar, and left behind ancient, enigmatic ruins...
When war among the gods brought tragedy, the ancestors of Chenyu Vale's people were reduced to wandering refugees.
Their descendents once believed in a now-forgotten god, and all are now lost to history and consigned to dust.
"An unsound theory," responded the consultant in the dark robes, "the history of mortals is one filled with rebirth."
"Glory and ruin both spring from mortals themselves. Without agency, there is no rise or fall to speak of."
"Ancient ruins lie forsaken, but their former inhabitants, buffeted by fate, live on to this day..."
"The fading of their ancestors has given rise to the prosperity of today... even if they are now assimilated, one with the people of a new god."
"Even if they are often helpless in matters great and small, they have not been destroyed by circumstance, but rather made their own choices."
"As for the wisdom and laws of the gods, they are based on the consensus of mortals, and not personal whim."
After a short while, the trivial debate over tea came to an inconclusive end. Such discussions between mortals and gods are wont to end in squabbling over this and that.
But the Bishui River flows eternal, just as the luster of the sacred jade within remains as constant as its former master.

Viewed in the moonlight, the swirling of blood-red light can be discerned within.
Liyue master craftsman Han Wu had a son with his first wife. The son's name was "Han Ce, the Cold and Calculating." Cold, because his father wished him to be cool-headed and rational. Calculating, because his father wished him to be precise in his craft, that he might inherit the family business.
But Han Ce had other ambitions. During his days as a student, Han Ce idled away his study time on martial arts fiction, while spending his free time practicing the art of the polearm up in the mountains. He was consumed by the desire to become a martial nomad, roaming the world with his pole for protection.
When he scoured the lands in search of Aerosiderite, he sought not the rare ore itself but the thrill of adventure. And when he ascended the highest peaks to commune with the adepti, he desired not the wisdom of the sages but the tale of his travels.
Han Ce cared not for the flames of the furnace and the working of weaponry. His father scolded him, but it was to no avail. Eventually, Han Ce left home one day without bidding his father farewell.
In his later years, Han Wu was involved in a mining accident that profoundly changed his temperament. Han Ce caught wind of the ordeal and hurried home to see his father, traveling through the night.
Previously hot-tempered and never short of something to say, Han Wu was now calm and quiet. He no longer held any animosity towards his son for his reluctance to take over the forge.
Finally, the father and son grew close for the first time in their lives. Han Ce was ashamed of his past actions, but knew not how to redeem himself.
Several years later, Han Wu breathed his last. Thus ended the life of a master craftsman of a generation. Per his father's will, Han Ce retrieved an archive of weapon designs from the study - they were the fabled prototypes.
The archive was sealed inside a wooden chest along with a letter addressed to Han Ce.
"To my dear son, Han Ce. The world is vast and filled with many marvels. May you always see the wonder in the world, wherever your journey takes you."
The designs were covered in comments penned by his father.
Han Ce was overjoyed at the sight and proceeded to peruse them all night long.
As Han Ce stepped outside the door of the study at the first light of dawn, he watched in wonder as a meteorite fell from the sky. It crashed down right before him in front of the Han residence, landing perfectly vertical.
A host of emotions flooded Han Ce's heart. Tears both of joy and sorrow streamed down his face as he cried, "The heavens have spoken! The heavens have spoken!"
Han Ce took the pitch-black aerosiderite and added it to the blackcliff that remained in the forge. Following his late father's designs to the letter, he crafted a pointed pole with a sharp tip that shimmered like ice and a body hard as bedrock.
Han Ce could have traveled the world with this trusty weapon in hand, but he chose not to. For Han Ce vowed that starting that day, never again would the flames of the furnace die out, and never again would the working of weaponry cease.

Description[]
The naginata was a lethal weapon by which scattered dross might be cut away.
And the one who wielded that naginata was one who guarded the path to eternity.
When the one who stood high above the storm clouds looked upon the mortal world, which she so loved,
Seeing their shallow disputes and transient obsessions...
Such contentions stemmed from needless attachments and unchecked desire — both enemies of eternity.
The wild weeds that disturbed the unchanging world would be swept away by the lightning.
"Well then — what sort of Eternity would ▉▉'s eyes reflect?" So asked the clergyperson who sloshed and drank wine with her under the sakura tree in that still-clear memory.
What a pointless question. Though the answer she gave them was lost to the alcohol,
She had gained the answer countless times in those memories. One must thin fruits to improve their quality, and plants used in dyes must have their flowers pruned.
Not a single speck of dross could be permitted in an eternal paradise.
"Ah, but even so..."
"Using that great blade of light to uproot all obsession and to eliminate the possibility for dreams to take root and wither by themselves..."
"A tranquil world that brooks no dispute, no gain, or no loss... It shall be an amnesiac world, lost to itself."
In the heart of eternity, those old friends still appear so clear and the scent of the sakura remains so fresh.
But I will never forget you, just as I will not forget the things that were lost across the years.
After all...
Having witnessed the pitch-dark annihilation consume those precious to her,
How could she not see the absurd nature of life and death, yes, incomprehensible destiny itself, as her mortal foe?
But since no one can overturn the impermanence of the world,
and the barren nature of this game,
Then let the eternal euthymia within her heart carry forth into the nation she loves.

Trivia[]
The Japanese name of the polearm Kusanagi no Inabikari (Japanese: 草薙の稲光 "Lightning of Grass-Cutting") may be a reference to Kusanagi no Tsurugi (Japanese: 草薙の剣 "Sword of Grass-Cutting"), one of the Three Imperial Regalia of Japan. In Shinto, the sword symbolizes the valor of an emperor and the nation.
The mythology says the sword was found from the dead body of the great serpent Yamata no Orochi (which may have inspired the serpent god Orobashi in the game), who had been slain by the storm god Susanoo no Mikoto. Susanoo then rescued and married the damsel in distress  Kushinadahime, who is the goddess of rice plant, which in turn is traditionally associated with thunder and lightning. For example, Inazuma ("Lightning") literally means the "Spouse of Rice-Plant" (Susanoo in this case).
According to legends, the sword was wielded by the hero Yamato Takeru, when one of his enemies set a fire to burn him in the midst of the field. He then cut down the grass with this sword to reverse the direction of the flames; one legend from the classic Nihon Shoki even says the magical sword moved autonomously for this action. Hence the sword earned the name Kusanagi ("Grass-Cutting").
The form of Engulfing Lightning is most similar to that of a naginata.

Description[]
"The forest used to be a giant maze many, many moons ago..."
The last king of the forest had returned to Sarva, leaving one who once waited upon him to inherit the name "Tiger."
In the past, wherever there was shade, there was the domain of the forest king. And as he wandered through his own territory,
The birds and beasts that depended on the jungle would bow their heads as he passed by to show their respect and reverence.
All Kings had their own palaces: as each successive king of the forest took the throne, the forest changed according to his image and vision.
The palace of the last king of the forest was hidden behind a fence of trees and vines, and beyond a network of water and cliffs,
It is the disc of pearls made by moonlight through leaves on still water. The king was at the water's edge, basking in the twice and much moonlight all by himself.
Thus did the forest maze come about. Legend has it that the forest king traced the path of a maze in his dazzling dappled stripes.
Each generation of Kings' palaces piled on top of each other so that the paths would intertwine from tree to tree. Streams would break off or would give birth to new branches,
The forest paths growing ever more complex. Only the forest king, we Aranara, and the people from the king tree's sanctuary,
Could freely go into the forest king's sanctuary and find their own way from tree to tree and stream to stream.
Later, the last king of the forest died protecting the forest. The forest would make no new palace, and the maze would disappear henceforth.
Or perhaps it was a dark herd of beasts that, like a hurricane, brought down the trees like waves of wheat. Either way, the maze was dead, and so was the forest king.
The Aranara, who gave me this story, was very timid and did not want us to hear him sing, always seeking a place of solitude.
One night, he went through a maze in the forest, and found a bright reflection of the moon in the water. Thus did he hear the story of the last king of the forest.
Then the current changed and the moon's reflection was scattered. Much has changed, and yet, much still remains the same.
But even if you, like me, have never met a king, you would still get the impression that Tiger was a noble and powerful king of the forest.

Gameplay Notes[]
Each separate weapon in the series can stack. Having multiple characters equip this weapon on the team will not stack, but Freedom-Sworn and Elegy for the End will.
However, the ATK +20% buff, being identical on all Millennial Movement weapons, will not stack.
Sigils of Remembrance last for 30 seconds before disappearing if "Millennial Movement: Farewell Song" is not activated. Gaining a new Sigil of Remembrance will refresh this duration for all existing Sigils of Remembrance.
Description[]
"The west wind bears wine's fragrance away,"
"The mountain wind brings glad tidings new."
"The breeze from afar tugs at my heart,"
"It sings of my longing for you."
Long ago, there was a knight who was ever dour of countenance.
Only a certain song could ever cause his brow to unfurl,
And only a certain girl who sang that song in the square,
Could cause him to forget the great burden of his duty for a time.
But at last, calamity came upon this land.
The songs that had once flown joyfully in the wind were drowned by a venomous dragon.
In the wake of its earth-shaking footsteps, even the cries and the flames were ripped asunder.
The Anemo Archon heard their agony, though he had refused to rule.
But to protect his old friends' dream, and defend the wind-kissed fields of green,
He woke from his long slumber anew, and with the sky dragon in battle he flew...
The Knight and his knights also fought for their land.
When the venomous dragon fell to ruin on the ice-sealed peak, the blue sky dragon fell asleep in the ancient tower.
But the Knight was in the valley, spent of his life's blood, and as he fell, he could only think thus:
"She is abroad studying, so she should be well. But ah, how I wish to hear her sing again."
"At least Arundolyn and Roland are alright. When she returns, this calamity should have blown over."
The songs in praise of the archon and tunes that recorded the battle of the two dragons were many, but all slowly became lost.
The song the girl loved to sing, too, changed upon her return.
"The dandelions carry in the summer wind,"
"Autumn brings the fragrance of grain."
"But no wind in any season on earth"
"Shall have you gaze upon me again."
And after her voice and her tears had run dry, the girl swore to use her life's flame to cleanse the world's crookedness.

Description[]
In a barren ancient time, when the now-verdant land was still but a wasteland, a maiden, barefoot in the snow, followed the footsteps of the Lord of the Tower.
He once was her love, but the unforgiving winds could never understand the softness of mortal flesh. He once was her foe, but her hunt was for more than simple vengeance.
"I dreamt of ocean waves and sand, of lush forests and land." "I dreamt of boars playing in berry bushes, of a towering spire." These words she spoke to the God King in a soft tone, but they were left unheard.
Awoken from blind love, she realized she was the only one who spoke with sincerity. For he spoke of love, but was only accompanied by razor winds. He looked down at the bent backs of his subjects in the howling wind, believing it to be a sign of their adoration and unwavering obedience.
It was the era when the Tyrant of the North Wind warred with the Lord of the Tower. The huntress thought herself loved by the slavemaster. At the end of the war, and when the wind of resistance first blew, in the company of a nameless young man, elf, and knight, she scaled the towering spire and challenged the eccentric lord.
"Finally, I shall hold his gaze."
But it was not until the moment when her arrow flew toward him, and when the piercing wind was about to rip her asunder, that she finally realized their distance apart.
Lore[]
This bow was originally wielded by Amos, who used it to hunt boars. It is also the bow she used in her attempt to slay Decarabian.

Trivia[]
It is currently unclear who the knight mentioned in the description is. It was originally assumed to be the Red-Haired Warrior, who was one of the four members of the group depicted in The Boy and the Whirlwind trailer. However, after the release of Freedom-Sworn, the Red-Haired Warrior was separated into a fifth member of the group, leaving the knight's identity a mystery; it is theorized to be Gunnhildr, whose participation in the rebellion was attested to in Biography of Gunnhildr but was not depicted in The Boy and the Whirlwind.
Various characters are seen wielding this weapon in their official Character Demos or Collected Miscellany videos:
Fischl - Character Demo - "Fischl: Glanz der Nacht"｜Genshin Impact
Ganyu - Character Demo - "Ganyu: Radiant Dreams" | Genshin Impact and Collected Miscellany - "Ganyu: Ambling Amidst Karst Peaks" | Genshin Impact
Ganyu can also be seen wielding Amos' Bow in a cutscene in Where the Heart Finds Rest, and is seen wielding the ascended version of this bow in her Genius Invokation TCG Character Card.

Description[]
A nimble sword with holes and delicate engravings on the blade. The sword once made the sound of a flute when wielded by one with the requisite skill. The pitch and tone were determined by the swinging angle.
This sword was buried when the Wanderer's Troupe disbanded. Unearthed years later, it has long since lost its ability to sing.
Even so, it still makes for a lethal weapon.
Among the members of the Wanderer's Troupe was a valiant sword-wielding dancer.
After the Troupe's attempt to tear down the ruling class failed, she was enslaved as a gladiator.
Though all her hope and all her companions were lost, still she fought bravely.
Her sword sang with the radiance of the morn's light, and she was dubbed the "Dawnlight Swordswoman."
In his youth, the Dawn Knight Ragnvindr was in the retinue of a knight.
He went with his master to watch a gladiator match, and was moved by the Dawnlight Swordswoman's splendid finale.
He named himself the Dawn Knight in her honor, and knew in his heart what he must do next.

Description[]
Legend has it that Mondstadt once played host to one who made music on bowstrings—
Or perhaps it might be more fitting to say that this wandering musician used an instrument's strings to fire arrows.
But this is naught but an old folk legend.

Amber is seen wielding this bow in her wish art.
Diona is seen wielding this bow in her Genius Invokation TCG Character Card.
The legend of the "wandering musician" mentioned in the bow's lore likely refers to the Sojourner. He lived in Mondstadt 1000 years ago and wielded The Stringless, a bow that doubled as a harp.

Description[]
The ancients say that the mountains of Mt. Tianheng are filled with gems, and the depths of The Chasm are rich with jade. The nation of a thousand hills has long been known for its abundance,And its most critical mining and smelting facilities are located in Blackcliff Forge, carved into Mt. Tianheng itself.The Forge was constructed by excavating the mountains, with countless workshops, furnaces, and connecting tunnels blasted black by dust.In the tumultuous years when the fires of war dyed the land red, this place was also where the ancestors of the mountain tribes sought shelter.It is even said that long-forgotten passages are within, tunnels to an ancient underground realm that lies in the deep places beneath the earth...According to the Stone Tablet Compilations, the first to carve the darkened paths through the mountains was the founder of the famous Yun family of Liyue.From that time hence, their clan, a house of smiths, has taken its place on the stage of history, regarded as honored progenitors by countless generations of artisans thereafter.As for the stories of that person, the annals of history leave but a scant few lines—"Such was Yun's ingenious craft that wood and bamboo might be carved into birds who would fly for three days without landing. Such were the works considered the apex of artisanry."The study of mechanisms and the art of forging were all initially inextricably intertwined with the adepti.As such, the founder was oft regarded as an apprentice of the adepti, and the techniques employed by said founder considered adepti teachings.The tale most widely known today is that this personage once fought alongside Rex Lapis on campaign,And having accomplished much, was acknowledged by three adepti, one after the other, and was granted instruction in secret mechanical arts.Legend has it that these divine techniques were such that even clouds could be plucked from the skies with which manses might be molded,And even the rotting, wasting wood could be fashioned into moving birds and beasts, so alike to life as to confound the observing eye.As such, the phrase "The Blackcliff, forged from clouds" has long been widely known in Liyue,And poets and storytellers have long delighted in the contrast between the two images.Though the legend of "cloud-forging" is a fanciful latter-day play on the family name "Yun" meaning "cloud,"None dispute that the rest of the founder's life was dedicated to the Blackcliff Forge and the teaching of craftsmanship.At life and legend's end, the founder ascended in heavenly light, becoming the guardian star of artisanry.Still, legends are naught but legends. It was no adeptal art that built the Forge, nor was it woven of whisps of wind and cloud.Instead, it was chiseled out one flake and one hammerstroke at a time, by the pouring sweat of countless ordinary artisans' brows over long centuries.Deus Auri's contract never stipulated that mortal resolve could never surpass adeptal miracles, after all."Such was Yun's ingenious craft that wood and bamboo might be carved into birds who would fly for three days without landing. Such were the works considered the apex of artisanry.""Yet Yun's life and career were spent working rock into workshops, and molding clouds into manses. Thus was the Blackcliff forged in Tianheng, that the well-being of all the people might be served.""For thus Yun said: What is clever? And what is clumsy? That which benefits the people is clever, and that which does otherwise is clumsy."

Gameplay Notes[]
The Elemental Skill CD reset effect has a chance to activate for each hit that deals damage to an enemy as well as for each enemy hit while the character is on the field. Therefore:
Multi-hit skills such as Diona's Icy Paws (5 hits) are more likely to activate the passive.
Skills that deal AoE damage are more likely to activate the passive if the skill hits multiple enemies.
If the character equipped with the weapon is not on the field when they deal damage, the passive will not activate.
If the enemy is Immune to the damage dealt, then the passive will not activate.
The Elemental Skill CD reset effect will trigger even if Elemental Skill is not on cooldown.
For Elemental Skills with multiple charges, the passive will only reset cooldown for one charge at a time. The Elemental Skill cooldown shown on the timer is the cooldown that will be reset.
There are certain specific attacks that, despite being considered Elemental Skill DMG, cannot trigger the CD reset. They include:
 Palm Vortex's Cutting DMG and absorbed elemental DMG during Cutting
 Yoohoo Art: Fuuin Dash's Fuufuu Windwheel DMG and absorbed elemental DMG while rolling
 "Come 'n' Get Me, Hag!"'s additional Phantom Explosion DMG
 Meow-teor Kick's Urgent Neko Parcel Hit DMG
 Thundering Might's additional Electro DMG
Description[]
On the cliff facing the eastern sea, the ancestors worshipped the masters of Time and Anemo together.
The two are intimately related, as expressed in the saying, "Anemo brings stories while Time nurtures them."
This sword tells the story of protection to show the courage to protect.
Originally just a prop, its blade was sharpened by the passage of time.
This sword once belonged to the kindly Gunnhildr clan. In sacrificial ceremonies, they would enact the defense of Mondstadt.
There were three acts in the ceremony dedicated to the winds of time.
The final act told a tale of the protection of Mondstadt, of life, and of freedom.
The ceremony and its history have now been lost.
But the Gunnhildr clan continues to act as guardians of Mondstadt to this day.

Description[]
"Once upon a time, there was a princess named Cinnamon..."
"...and with the tiger by her side, she left the palace once and for all. The end."
But this tale belongs to your kind. In your stories, everything always has a deeper meaning.
I understand that this "palace" is everything that makes Cinnamon human:
Others who share the same bloodline, a more than spacious living place, common sense, and life lessons — while the King was the wish lurking and glowing in her mind like moonlight.
Yet for us, a palace is a palace, Cinnamon is Cinnamon, the Forest King is the Forest King, and moonlight is just the moonlight.
The story I heard is at variance with the story of Cinnamon.
Once upon a time, there was a child who lost her way in the forest. Following the footprints left by the Forest King, she stepped into the tiger's garden.
"Grrrr! Be it birds or beasts, my stomach bids everyone welcome, while the earth awaits their return."
"I am the king of the forest. I slaughter, and I foster. Only a puny human like you have I yet to sample."
So said the tiger. However, the child hadn't yet forgotten your language, and naturally, she couldn't understand the King.
"Grrr," the child imitated.
The Forest King was amused. Usually, when he spoke, your kind would hide in their wooden houses,
And beasts would lie on the ground, not daring to move even an inch, and birds would fly away towards the sun. Even those Rishboland Tigers, mighty as they may appear, would hide themselves in the bushes.
"Grrr! A tiny outsider who does not understand etiquette. Alright, then let me teach you all about the forest, and its language you shall learn."
"From now on, you are my squire. This forest will forever be open to you and all beings here can do harm to you no more."
"Remember, this whole world is but a dream of the forest. One day you shall awake from your reality and find your place in this boundless hunting ground."
"Where our prey head without fail, we shall arrive at one day as well. Always keep that in mind."
There will always be a new king to inherit the seat from his predecessor. The circle of life applies to you, to us, and to every being in the forest just the same.
Before the squire met her fate together with the King, a lost child stumbled into the palace without scrunching a single fallen leaf.
She passed on all her knowledge to the child. Just as this story was passed on to me, that child passed on the teachings to the children who came after.
Later, some children became the guardians of the forest, passing on the forest's language and the responsibility of protecting the King's land to their future successors.
And others, when they gazed upon the great agony others suffered, decided to bid farewell to the hunting ground and become hunters who would terrify even the most vicious beasts.

Description[]
This is a tale of sky-shaking valor.
Even the vile dragon brought into the world by a sinner of that ancient abyssal nation.
Lost dark, metallic wings to Anemo's pride and joy.
Long ago, the shadow dragon Durin terrorized Mondstadt, driven by jealousy for the city's glory.
Awoken from his sylvan slumber by the cries of Durin's victims,
The Anemo Archon came forth and summoned his faithful servant to his side.
For life and for freedom, the Archon and the Wind Dragon rode the wind to face their foe.
In a battle that ripped clouds from the skies, Dvalin spread his six blessed wings wide,
Severing the sky and tearing through Durin's iron scales with the force of a colossal blade.
As the conflict plunged the world into darkness, the Wind Dragon struck out with his claws, like swords forged of wind.
They pierced deep into Durin's dark, corrupt flesh.
The battle shook the heavens, even the sun quaked with fear.
Finally, Dvalin tore out Durin's throat with his teeth, and the evil dragon fell from the sky.
With his god's blessing, the Wind Dragon seized victory and saved the people of Mondstadt.
Yet Dvalin became poisoned by tainted blood he had consumed, and corruption seeped into his bones.
Though a hero, Dvalin was forced to suffer in solitude, while the stench of corruption drew creatures of evil to his side.
Deceived by the Abyss, the Wind Dragon fell to evil, and Stormterror was born.
At last, his master returned to calm his frenzied mind and ease his pain.
His faithful friend and a new companion fought bravely to drive out the monsters and restore Dvalin's honor.
In the century while Dvalin slept, his image faded from Mondstadt's memory,
But in the tumultuous times of the recent past, the people bore witness to his six-winged figure once more.
Now, blessed by the Anemo Archon, serenaded by the songs of Barbatos,
Riding on the boundless winds, Dvalin takes to the skies once more.

Description[]
A long blade of the color of blood, upon which has been bestowed the name Isshin. It is remarkably sharp and vividly ominous.
It is said that this blade can easily cleave through a porous bamboo basket and the water within it before the latter can even leak out.
People often say that within the body of every blade rests a blade-spirit.
Then it is natural to assume that a blade forged by the Tatarigami is dwelled by a demon of malice.
The renowned blade Kagotsurube Isshin is forged by the swordsmith Akame Kanenaga, who failed to become the head blacksmith.
Though forged by the hand of an Inazuman swordsmith, this blade was not made in the nation of thunder and Jade Steel, but in a snow-covered land in the far north.
If beheld in the moonlight, the blade's hamon would look as if it were flowing, like the blood and tears of a wayfaring wanderer.
"The 'Tatarigami' is pure malice by nature. It bears resentment against mortal desire."
"Swords are merely instruments of misfortune. Without wickedness, they will not birth slaughter. Without hate, they would never know the taste of blood."
"'Isshin' is the stillness of the mind, free of distractions. This purity of desire empowers the swordsmith to forge tirelessly."
"But by this token, resentment against living beings is the metal from which a blade that kills shall be forged."
In their frenzied passion to practice "Isshin," the Akame School had always pursued the forging of a killer blade that could reach the extremes of lethality.
As such, the body and mind of the members of the Akame School were often withdrawn and short-spanned, their hearts venomously graven.
The blades made by the Akame School were keen indeed, but many of them had some evil within that ultimately led to the school itself being regarded by the authorities as "undesirable."
For this reason, the Akame School's position as the leader of the Isshin Art, passed down from Mitsunaga, did not last three generations before being rescinded by the authorities.
After that, Akame Kanenaga was involved in the Case of the Eccentric and committed treason.
This led him to change his name and leave for a snow-covered nation in the far north, to make a humble living in the land ruled by imperious ice.
The only wish of the deceased Kaedehara was to see the Isshin Art celebrated by those who understood a sword's beauty.
But the swordsmith, the blade, and the Tatarigami were all tools and titles for people to wield...
"I spent half of my life in pursuit of the vanity that is the Isshin Art, it only turned out that I became another 'Kaedehara'!"
"Ah, what's done is done. My only hope is that the sword born in the ice and frost will not be as weak as its useless title..."
The Kaedehara Clan were master swordsmiths whose works best symbolized Masagomaru's style; whilst the Niwa Clan were humble and diligent, skilled in clay tempering.
In their frenzied passion to practice "Isshin," the Akame School had always pursued the forging of a killer blade that could reach the extremes of lethality.
As he passed away amidst the vast snow, the man only wished to forge a renowned blade with which to restore the name of Kaedehara and win back the recognition of the people...
Lore[]
Akame Kanenaga, a skilled swordsmith who fled Inazuma to Snezhnaya when Scaramouche was executing the destruction of the Isshin Art of the Raiden Gokaden, forged Kagotsurube Isshin out of regret. He used the power of the Tatarigami to infuse the blade with its own consciousness and, on his deathbed, told the blade of his wish to show Inazuma that the Isshin Art could still produce magnificent blades and was still worthy of the Raiden Shogun's trust.
The blade then began his long journey back to Inazuma. However, the hatred that is intrinsic to the Tatarigami warped the blade's drive into a desire to rival the gods at any cost, and he began to use humans as tools in his journey by possessing them until they were no longer of use before discarding them.
By the time the blade arrived in Inazuma, his power was greatly diminished. During the events of Kaedehara Kazuha's Story Quest Acer Palmatum Chapter: Act I - A Strange and Friendless Road, he encounters Kazuha and is forced to face his lack of power as well as the truth of his own corruption by the source of his consciousness. He then decides to control Kazuha, with Kazuha's consent, to forge himself anew at the cost of his own consciousness so that Kazuha may use it in his studies, with the hope that the Isshin Art will one day produce a blade that will place the Isshin Art back in high regard by the Raiden Shogun. Before the blade's consciousness fades away, he reveals his name, Kagotsurube Isshin, to Kazuha.

Trivia[]
The sword is named after Kagotsurube (籠釣瓶), a haunted sword that appears in the kabuki play Kagotsurube Sato no Eizame (Japanese: 籠釣瓶花街酔醒). In the play, Kagotsurube is owned by Jirozaemon, a wealthy man from the country who falls in love with a courtesan. The courtesan has a lover who is hostile to Jirozaemon, which leads to a love triangle and eventually bloodshed when Jirozaemon uses his sword to kill the courtesan (and other characters, depending on the version of the play).
The name Kagotsurube (籠釣瓶) itself is explained as "a well bucket (釣瓶 tsurube) made from a bamboo basket (籠 kago)." Just as no water would remain in such a bucket, no drops of blood would remain on the sword's sharp edge.
The sword in the play is connected to legends of the 16th century swordsmith Muramasa. Because of their exceptional sharpness, Muramasa blades were favored by the early generations of the Tokugawa shogunate. When misfortune struck the Tokugawa clan, it was often associated with Muramasa blades not because they were cursed, but simply because most of their samurai used them. Later generations came to view Muramasa blades as sinister items, capable of bringing curses against the shogunate. Kabuki dramas from the 18th and 19th centuries, including Kagotsurube Sato no Eizame, reflect this later belief, depicting them as cursed swords with demonic powers that create bloodlust in their wielders. This particular image of Muramasa blades has carried on through Japanese popular culture since then.
This weapon was originally announced as "Cursed Blade" and continued to be called such on the official Genshin Impact Website throughout Version 2.8, but it is never referred to as such in-game.
Kaedehara Kazuha is seen wielding this sword in his Genius Invokation TCG character card.

Gameplay Notes[]
Despite the description only mentioning Normal Attack, the first stack of Mistsplitter's Emblem will also be granted if a Charged Attack deals Elemental DMG. However, Plunging Attacks do not grant a stack.
A maximum of 1 stack can be gained from each of the 3 scenarios. For example, dealing Elemental DMG with Normal Attacks twice will not grant 2 independent stacks, and will only refresh the 5s duration of the first stack.
While the passive effect is active, a purple glow will appear around the weapon. The brightness of the glow changes based on the number of stacks active.
Description[]
One of the swords that the Shogun bestowed upon her Hatamoto. It is said that it can call upon the power of lightning itself to slice through the mountain mist and night fog.
It was once shattered into a thousand pieces. After being reforged, a hamon resembling flowing clouds was left on the blade.
As the folk song goes: "Arataki of the Front Gate, Iwakura the Successor, Kitain the Serpent, Takamine the Mistsplitter."
Thus do children who love martial arts list famous historical martial artists, and "Takamine the Mistsplitter" was the very same user of this sword.
This man once accompanied a member of the clergy, using the Mistsplitter to slay countless demons and Tatarigami.
He also learned archery from the Yougou Tengu, and passed that knowledge on to a person he loved.
However, Mistsplitter would have no successors, and now only exists within storybooks, artworks, and fairytales.
At the end of his life, he assumed the position of one of the Shogun's yoriki and fought against a dark army.
If he hadn't left his beloved bow to her as part of their wager, maybe things would've been different.
But real gamblers never regret, never care about "what ifs," and never feel remorse over "if onlys."
The foe flooded over like mist — and so he would just keep slashing away with that secret blade that could disperse the brumous night.
As long as his strikes were swift enough, he would pierce the dark night, and day would come again—
"Asase, our promise... No, say rather our great bet. I will not lose it, not for the world!"
"I shall return, and together with the bow that I'd wagered... I'll claim the future as my prize!"
Like a never-ending chain of lightning, he and Mistsplitter slew countless demons together.
Yet at the last, the sword was not as tenacious as the swordsman, and it gradually broke down.
And he became submerged in that thick dark mist...
In the end, only some of the blade's fragments were retrieved for reforging, such that the resultant weapon might inherit the Mistsplitter name.
As though holding onto a spider's thread hanging down in the dark, the samurai held the handle of his broken sword tightly.
Amidst the dark mist, he kept stubbornly reminding himself:
The result of our wager is still undecided. I must return to Asase's side...

↑ Russian: Рассекающий Rassekayushchiy relates to the sword itself, not to the mist. In this case, Рассекающий туман Rassekayushchiy tuman would mean "The Sword Which Splits (the) Mist" or "Splitting the Mist."
↑ Japanese: 腰物 Koshimono may refer to various objects worn on one's hip, most commonly swords, but also including inro and money pouches.
↑ Spanish: Cortatinieblas is a portmanteau of corta "it cuts" and tinieblas "darkness," especially one caused by some kind of haze or smoke. The mention of the sheath may refer to the practice of iaijutsu, or quick draw (and subsequent sheathing) of a katana. Multiple characters from Inazuma appear to be practitioners of iaijutsu.

Gameplay Notes[]
The passive effect will not take place if the character equipping the weapon is fallen or is not in the party.
Description[]
They say that when Liyue first arose, Rex Lapis once walked the land with a sword hewn from jade.
Despite the constant wear and tear of age, the jade edge, so bathed in blood, still retained a polished sheen as if brand-new.
The blood was washed away in the rain of a thousand years, yet the thoughts and grudges that gathered about it could not be so easily eliminated.
"Nephrite has the soul of the Bishui's gentle heart, and will in time cleanse itself of the remnant grudges within."
"But who will ease the agony that the jade itself feels for having becoming an instrument of slaughter?"
These words of a friend long-forgotten were both lament and sigh.
But the inexorable gears of destiny would drown out those compassionate words.
In the passing of many long years, many became mortal foes who once made merry together,
While those who betrayed one another or fought to the death would come to share a drink, their hatred dispelled.
So it was also with this precious sword, carved as it once was to be given as an expensive gift to a certain someone.
This jade too was once cut for love of peace and luxury.
When wine vessels are filled with blood, and when tender feelings are ripped asunder by cold ambition and reduced to dust on the wind,
Gifts ungiven and bonds unspoken will become sharp blades with which to cleave erstwhile friends.

A lightweight greatsword made of white iron with a silver sheen. When swung rapidly, the flashes of light can blind the enemy. However, this sword is not usually used as a weapon.
According to the way of warriors of old, when a comrade falls in battle, polished weapons will line the ground where they fell. Though such rituals as these are no longer in fashion, some few still remember what they mean...

Description[]
Legends say the winter comes from Hyperborea, and the fjords and auroras there are curved and sharp as the fangs of wolves,
And the glaciers and snowfields are always fissuring forth new crevices, or filling them in, creating an ever-changing land.
Until at long last, the frozen earth cut itself from the umbilical cord of the continent, as though it had its own will or dreams,
Leaving behind only the legend of young Ajax, who discovered the country of gold and white stone in the depths of the frozen sea.
Amidst the frozen air slowly drifting from the thick layers of ice, the story of the young hero brings forth a sliver of warmth and light.
The stories about him are many. Sailed he a ship into the belly of a great whale, and fought he a dragon upon the frozen plains for seven days.
He and Snegurochka once fell in love, yet lost each other due to the wicked tricks of the changelings — a truly tragic tale.
The last story worth telling goes something like this.
The boy born to hunt fish beneath the ice with harpoons fell into a hitherto-undiscovered kingdom.
This ancient capital had sunk into the depths of the earth due to some ancient disaster, but despite being buried underground, it was still as bright as the dawn.
The solemn and silent king yet sat upon his massive chiseled white throne, the scepter in his hands not yet eaten away by insects,
And the silver-white trees in the courtyard were like the arms of a mother or a lover, holding the virtuous and wise priest in their embrace.
Beautiful yet treacherous life, twisted and violent monsters, one by one awakened from their thousand-year slumber...
A voice, seemingly from a faraway place...
"...Father! Father! Hey! We got a bite!"
"...Oh. Sorry."
"So what happened? What happened next?"
"Oh, right... Finally, the boy defeated the dragon that slept deep within the kingdom."
"The dragon's treasure was an infinite hoard of gold. But the boy was kind and brave, and knew that gold was the true cause of calamity and chaos, and so only took a small amount, enough for his own needs, and to cure his sick friends."
"Huh? Is that the end of the story?"
"The end."
"Really...? Then tell me another story!"
"Another story... Next time, alright? Let's stop here today, or even the fish will be scared away."

Description[]
The image of the Windblume has been lost amidst the flowing winds of time,
In times of peace, it has become synonymous with love and gladness.
Sometimes, even the forged weapons that are to be wielded for conquest and victory,
Are adorned with such flowers following the commissioner's or forger's wish.
It seems that this blade was custom-made by someone for their beloved.
"Iron blades fail to slash it, neither can imprisonment of stones confine it."
"The wind has no fear of future, only constantly flowing in its direction."
The nameless shepherd who belonged not to the church silently told of stories of the wind,
And presented the "flowers" to them in whose eyes the light yet shone.
If the noble descendants had all but forgotten their original oath, if the conceited silence rose to popularity,
Or if the principle of the blood stood against the flowing wind, the legend of trees and flowers would be forbidden.
In that era, numerous flowers blossomed in places not favored by people.
The flowers were swept away by the wind, yet left an instant of glorious charm in the bleak world.
"In the shadow cast by the tower of the past, in the alleys and streets of today,"
"In the smallest corners, the flowers are still blooming with the faintest glow."
The nameless shepherd who did not hail from the palace silently told of the flowers' stories.
He said: "Today, Ludi Harpastum has been taken away by the noble."
But did you know that, in the ruins where mighty winds once swept, there used to be blooming wild flowers over hill and dale?
Those flowers were not the common kind. The stronger the wind blew, the sturdier those flowers' root would grow, and the more they flourished.
The day when the kingdom was dotted with those flowers would be the day when the tower finally fell down.

Description[]
The knights of Mondstadt, whether it be by coincidence or fate,
Have as most their distinguished titles and corresponding animal insignia the following two:
The first is the title and repute of the Lion, passed down from the first Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius,
And the second, from almost the same period, is that of the Wolf Knight, Boreas.
There is, in truth, no record at all of the Knight of Boreas.
The name's origin instead comes from stories that circulated through the streets at that time.
At the end of the tale, the merchant (or farmer) whose daughter was saved asked:
"How can we ever thank you, O Honored Knight?"
The Knight replied: "When thine precious daughter is married, raise a glass in toast from afar."
"Ah! I am very sorry... if I am to toast you, might I humbly ask your distinguished name, O Knight?"
The Knight thought for a moment, and replied thusly:
"Then thou should toast my companion instead. 'Boreas' is his name."
The end of the story often goes something like this:
At the same time, in the forest (or on a mountainside, or someplace out of sight),
A sudden gust of wind blows. The merchant (or farmer) gazed in that direction,
But saw only a pair of bestial eyes in the darkness, cold as ice.
These two lights quickly disappeared. After the merchant (or farmer) came to, the Knight was gone as well.
There are many versions of the story, though the daughter is always saved, and the Knight is always nameless.
But before the story was a story, he was merely a strange traveler clad in a dust-stained and tattered cloak. Some noticed the exquisitely crafted yet battle-worn armor beneath the cape. But that didn't mean anything. Perhaps the armor's bearer was just another lost soul who had lost their prestigious position with the changes wrought by revolution.
The tavern's owner noticed that the man paid with real gold and silver coins, though none recognized the symbols on them. Still, that too meant nothing, for gold and silver have no master and are always changing hands. Nor would anyone speak ill of a customer who paid their tab on the spot and was not prone to rowdy drunkenness.
For its part, the story came from a snake demon who arrived on Mondstadt's shores from the sea beyond the horizon, following the current of warmth and peace. In the early days of the Knights of Favonius, when they were still weak, the nameless knight left the city to hunt demons, for the price of a single silver coin. The scent of blood and carrion rotting on the beach attracted thousands of falcons, who circled for days. Thus, the true origin of the name of Falcon Coast comes not from the romantic legend of the Falcon of the West.
In the years afterwards, the Knights of Favonius did their utmost to convince the nameless knight to join them, but he never agreed. In reality, the events that corresponded to the story of "Boreas" likely happened between the Grand Master of the early days of the founding of the Knights and the nameless knight. The events unfolded such that the Grand Master, having lost patience after being rejected countless times, had the nameless knight surrounded in the street. The two famous lines in the story were likely spoken when the nameless knight "Boreas" left, and though the meaning was similar, the tone of both sides was far less civil.
But such a story would be exceedingly dull if committed to poetry, and thus talented bards took that dialogue, combined it with a few events surrounding the Knight while he was in Mondstadt, and from that wove a multitude of stories.
Though he stayed in Mondstadt for but a few years, in leaving, his shadow has ever remained.

Description[]
Rumored to be a legendary orb of Liyue.
It once absorbed all the light in the world, but was kept inside a wooden box for millennia afterwards.
Even so, its power has not dissipated. Now released from its container, it shines evermore.
In the hands of a truly knowledgeable sage, perhaps its extraordinary power would finally be unleashed after lying dormant for millennia.
A story that has long been popular with the jewelers of Liyue holds that the master craftsman Kunwu once took the light of the heavenly bodies and sealed it in a wooden box.
Kunwu then buried that box deep inside a dark rocky chamber, where it remained in pitch blackness for forty-nine days and twenty hours, till finally the pearl within had absorbed the shine of the sun and moon.
A most bizarre tale indeed. And yet, to this day, many in Liyue hold steadfastly to their belief in the esoteric talents of the master craftsman Kunwu.
Someone once plucked up the courage to ask the aging craftsman what his secret was. The eccentric old man laughed off the nonsensical notion of his mystical capabilities:
"Pfft! 'Twas purely the product prolonged polishing!"
But his apprentice revealed a different story when asked about it in private: Just as Kunwu finished polishing the Solar Pearl, the splendor of the heavens shone down and a crimson moon filled the sky.
But did this phenomenon mean that Kunwu had indeed received divine assistance in his craft? Or was it a measure of his own accomplishment that his lofty ambitions had sufficed to send waves through the firmament and even elicit a response from the heavenly bodies?

Description[]
Thieves are, after all, thieves, no matter how clever their tricks.
Crimes must be publicly punished, and lies must be publicly exposed.
That is how the world ought to operate, and how righteousness should be.
But when it comes to "how things ought to be," it is always fiendishly difficult to get ideal results.
In her youth she fought with a young swordsman, but she was bewildered by his crafty eyes, and deceived by his intentionally slow rhythm,
She finally revealed a critical weakness that she normally never would and her arm was struck by his blade, forcing her to concede that her spearmanship was inferior.
She once thought to seek out that swordsman once again, and give it her all in a final duel, only to accidentally hear that he had long retired...
Long had he hidden his face, wounded in the pursuit of public service, beneath a mask, and he had lost the frivolous, provocative voice and cadence he once had.
Tired of all that the Marechaussee Hunters faced, he had turned to strong drink.
This was without doubt a betrayal of his past life, but the spear-wielder had to discover the truth behind the rumors for herself.
And so, chasing the swordsman's footsteps and wounds, she pursued her fated opponent...
Though someone dear were to fall upon the arena of fate, even if her heart were to be completely shattered,
After following the trail to the mask left behind by the swordsman, all her trials and tribulations seemed to have been rewarded at last.
However, the end of that pursuit was most unexpected, and had nothing to do with the justice sought by the once-legendary Champion Duelist...
"Ah, the renowned Marfisa this time, is it...?"
"Take heart. Your fine spear-arm will be of use."
"Master. This is already the second, I'm afraid that the next..."
"I know."

Description[]
"Why is your sword lying on the ground?"
"I'm sun-tanning the sword to make it darker."
"Why?"
"Good question, kid. What's the darkest thing you can think of?"
"Crows?"
"...Sure. What else?"
"Hm... Cooking pots!"
"Good. Keep going. What's underneath the cooking pot?"
"Fire!"
"And where does the fire come from?"
The girl thought for a bit.
"Coal! Coal is the darkest thing of all!"
"That's right! Coal, or carbon, is what makes iron stronger. But I figure I can just darken the sword by tanning it instead."
With that, he flipped the sword to the other side.

Description[]
One night, a Millelith officer drank with a poet, and brought his signature white-tasseled halberd with him.
The poet's ink was spilled.
And the halberd's white tassel was dyed black.
"'Tis but a tale of polearm wielder and poet."
"Unrelated to mine own black—tasseled polearm."
The old smith smacked his apprentice.
He demanded that he dye the newly made polearm's tassel black.

Gameplay Notes[]
The Elemental Skill CD reset effect has a chance to activate for each hit that deals damage to an enemy as well as for each enemy hit while the character is on the field. Therefore:
Multi-hit skills such as Diona's Icy Paws (5 hits) are more likely to activate the passive.
Skills that deal AoE damage are more likely to activate the passive if the skill hits multiple enemies.
If the character equipped with the weapon is not on the field when they deal damage, the passive will not activate.
If the enemy is Immune to the damage dealt, then the passive will not activate.
The Elemental Skill CD reset effect will trigger even if Elemental Skill is not on cooldown.
For Elemental Skills with multiple charges, the passive will only reset cooldown for one charge at a time. The Elemental Skill cooldown shown on the timer is the cooldown that will be reset.
There are certain specific attacks that, despite being considered Elemental Skill DMG, cannot trigger the CD reset. They include:
 Palm Vortex's Cutting DMG and absorbed elemental DMG during Cutting
 Yoohoo Art: Fuuin Dash's Fuufuu Windwheel DMG and absorbed elemental DMG while rolling
 "Come 'n' Get Me, Hag!"'s additional Phantom Explosion DMG
 Meow-teor Kick's Urgent Neko Parcel Hit DMG
 Thundering Might's additional Electro DMG
Description[]
In the early days, the people of Mondstadt had a tradition of building theaters on top of windy cliffs to please the gods.
Rituals took the form of performances, for they believed the gods enjoyed stories and ballads.
This script is millennia old, and is no longer legible.
Long ago, a war waged between the Lord of Storm and the Great Wolf King of the North. Mondstadt was engulfed in blizzards, and the snow stung like sand.
A group who could bear the cold no longer built a shrine high on a clifftop in the east. There, they prayed for divine mercy and protection.
The wind blows for a moment, but the ravages of time are constant, unrelenting, and irreversible.
A god of the winds may move between the pages of a book, but in the end, the merciless god of time will eat away at them until not a single legible word remains.
Yet, time's assault and that of the wind often take their toll the same upon the heart.
Perhaps that is why later generations presumed the shrine to have always been to the wind, and the wind alone.

Description[]
From the land of gold came a wanderer, his body and mind scarred by the touch of battle.
He was once a prince, but now, he was merely someone lost in a winding and deceptive verdant maze.
The ancient forest king, tasting the scent of blood that stems from authority, was unable to hold back a deep sigh...
Summons were sent, and a huntress bearing a moon-white bow came forth, tasked to hunt the trapped beast that had come from beyond the woods.
The sky was overcast, spreading like ink blots in the clouds. Death whispered through the wooded maze, groping for a path to follow.
Following the exile's footsteps, the curse spread across the desert sands to swallow the "living" lands.
Through jade hallways and pathways narrow, she discovered the intruder's intent from the strangeness of their scent...
Adrift between memory and ambition, however, the exile was lost amidst the discord of running water and birdsong...
"You have been struck with one of my arrows, insolent invader! The next shall find its path into your heart."
"No longer shall you loiter in the forest. No longer shall you disturb the dreams of the children. The crown you seek, you shall not find here!"
Thus did the hale huntress warn her prey, that none yet had ever evaded her arrows or her perspicacity.
Yet, for reasons unknown, she lowered her bow by a few inches and deliberately missed the addled man.
The greenery looked on, bewildered, and the dream-hidden children exhaled as blood went unspilled.
The slumbering forest king, blessed with insight that can pierce through all dreams, understood her intent and gave a thunderous murmur that caused even the greatest of trees to tremble:
"That mortal is not alike to you. He comes from a sordid land, and his hands are stained with blood, while his heart festers with delusions and madness."
"But the forest only keeps dreams wrought from naivete, and blood is only meant to be shed for the hunt or in sacrifice — in this there can be no deception."
"If you believe that he yet has the potential to reclaim his honor in the maze, then guide him to break off the pale branch..."
"Only then can the bright moon and the newborn stars grant him pure wisdom and help him shed his bitter memories and desires."
So, she again took hold of her pure-white bow and drove the exile, sending him fleeing into the depths of the maze...
The truth of what happened afterward was witnessed by the moon and the stars, and only dwells still in the dreams of children.
Some rumors say that the exiled noble finally used the pale branch to forge a blade that belonged to him and him alone,
While some children claim in their sleep that he forgot the name of his home, and of his dream to be king.
Regardless, Prince Faramarz's name vanished within the rainforest henceforth, returning to the desert on the back of sand carried by the wind.

Gameplay Notes[]
The Elemental Skill CD reset effect has a chance to activate for each hit that deals damage to an enemy as well as for each enemy hit while the character is on the field. Therefore:
Multi-hit skills such as Diona's Icy Paws (5 hits) are more likely to activate the passive.
Skills that deal AoE damage are more likely to activate the passive if the skill hits multiple enemies.
If the character equipped with the weapon is not on the field when they deal damage, the passive will not activate.
If the enemy is Immune to the damage dealt, then the passive will not activate.
The Elemental Skill CD reset effect will trigger even if Elemental Skill is not on cooldown.
For Elemental Skills with multiple charges, the passive will only reset cooldown for one charge at a time. The Elemental Skill cooldown shown on the timer is the cooldown that will be reset.
There are certain specific attacks that, despite being considered Elemental Skill DMG, cannot trigger the CD reset. They include:
 Palm Vortex's Cutting DMG and absorbed elemental DMG during Cutting
 Yoohoo Art: Fuuin Dash's Fuufuu Windwheel DMG and absorbed elemental DMG while rolling
 "Come 'n' Get Me, Hag!"'s additional Phantom Explosion DMG
 Meow-teor Kick's Urgent Neko Parcel Hit DMG
 Thundering Might's additional Electro DMG
Description[]
On the cliff facing the eastern sea, the ancestors worshipped the masters of Time and Anemo together.
The two are intimately related, as expressed in the saying, "Anemo brings stories while Time nurtures them."
The sword tells a story of war, and was used in the enactment of war tales.
Originally just a prop, its blade has been hardened by the passage of time.
This sword once belonged to the Imunlaukr clan, a clan of brave and gifted warriors who fought hard and died young.
In sacrificial ceremonies, they would enact duels between brave warriors stained black with blood.
In the eyes of the Imunlaukr clan, combat existed not for protection, for glory, or for gaining territory.
Rather, it was for the amusement of the gods, high up in the heavens, for whom little else could serve to entertain.
Monsters and outlaws, they fought them all the same, with no regard for whether, this time, they would return to their beloveds afterwards.
For none of that mattered. What mattered was to roar, loud and clear, in the heat of bloody battle. That was duty fulfilled.
Such hot blood running through the veins should not have been conducive to a long history for the Imunlaukr clan.
For their fight was one without end, and without hope of victory.
And yet, as the snow slowly melted and Mondstadt began to take shape, gradually they realized: They had found something to fight for at last.

Description[]
This blade was recorded in the "Anthology of Inazuman Blades" written by Inspector Mikoshi Nagamasa of Tatarasuna.
There were two swords of the "Geppaku Futsu" series made by the Futsu school by order: "Hasui," the Wavespike, and "Haran," the Rippling Upheaval.
Of these two, the "Haran" is the sole blade forged by the great smith Masagomaru that remains extant.
Many say that blades are indwelt with the souls of those who forge them...
This is how the Anthology begins.
It is said that the Hasui blade was forged by the third-generation master of the school, Master Futsu Minori.
Its blade was a pale blue, and its hamon was as beauteous as rippling water, and so it was oft found at the waist of the Shogun's valet.
Later, the blade would be broken during a mortal duel to decide the fate of the oni people, and was sent back for reforging.
At this time, Minori, who had by now been long tortured by alcohol, old wounds, and the lingering memories of Tatarigami, was a broken woman, not unlike an untempered steel sword.
Nor could the fourth-generation head Futsu Hiroyoshi match his mother's skill.
It was his sworn brother, Futsu Masayoshi, the one they call Masagomaru—
He was the one who would forge this weapon, allowing the Futsu school's masterpiece to re-enter this world.
The two Geppaku Futsu blades look very similar to one another, but their qualities are in fact vastly different.
Masagomaru would only come to name this one work, and the reason why that happened is quite simple, really...
He was an orphan taken in by the third-generation master, illiterate by education and aphasic from birth.
When ordered to revive the beauty of the "Hasui" blade, he inscribed its name just as it had been before.
When Futsu Minori passed on, Masagomaru would help her pass her forging techniques on to Hiroyoshi.
Indeed, it is said that she had wished for him to take up the mastery of their school, but he demurred multiple times.
Indeed, the fame from the forging of the "Haran" very nearly affected Hiroyoshi's succession to be the fourth-generation head.
As such, safe in the knowledge that his sworn brother was now independent, Masagomaru would choose to depart for other lands.
Later, he would approach other forging schools, gleaning gems of wisdom from other famed smiths.
In his latter years, he would have three pupils that he was most proud of: Kaedehara Kagemitsu, Niwa Nagamitsu, and Akame Mitsunaga.
These three would create the "Isshin Sansaku," the three great works of the Isshin Art.
"Then, I was but a born-mute, an ugly, filthy, abandoned child."
"Like a moth, I longed for warmth in the bitter, cold nights, and what I found was the forge-fires of the smithy."
"Standing before me was the third-generation master, she who people called surly and arrogant."
"But she did not bid me to get gone, and even gave me some rice to fill my stomach."
"Seeing that I was covered in metallic sand, she named me 'Masagomaru.'"
Unable to speak but subtle in thought, Masagomaru must have had many stories hidden away in his heart.
All those unsaid things would finally sink as sediment, disappearing beneath the waves...
"The third-generation master would tell me, one who could not speak, a great many things."
"Like the old wound that afflicted one side of her body, like the wishes of her mother and brother,"
"Like the crimson hakama she could never wear, and the giant wave that would one day devour everything..."
One night, the child would enter the smithy, seeing the famed but capricious smith within.
She hammered at a chunk of iron, not caring as tears streamed down her face...
"You forget what you just saw. We clear about that?"
He nodded, flustered. Then the woman suddenly clapped her hands together and smiled broadly.
"Right, silly me! You're a good friend, a real keeper of secrets!"
"I suppose it is as they say: one who leans into the drink is themselves not to be leaned on too much."
"But now that I think about it, I should still have accepted her offer to drink together..."
The "Anthology" also speaks of the differences in form between the Geppaku Futsu blades.
The one forged by Futsu Minori was as gently beauteous as the ocean at night, and thus was named "Hasui."
The one made by mute Masayoshi was formidable as the driving hurricane, and was thus called "Haran."

This weapon was originally forged by Futsu "Masagomaru" Masayoshi in Inazuma, at an unknown forge. There is a matching, currently unplayable sword known as the "Hasui Geppaku Futsu", which was forged by Masayoshi's mother, Futsu Minori.

Trivia[]
Etymology[]
The latter part of the name for this weapon, Futsu (Japanese: 経津 Futsu), comes from the name Futsunushi (Japanese: 経津主神 Futsunushi-no-Kami), a warrior god in Japanese mythology.
Futsunushi is closely associated with Takemikazuchi, a thunder and sword god in Japanese mythology.
The use of the word 経津 futsu could be a play on its homonym 不通 futsu which means "cessation," as opposed to 波乱 haran, "turbulence."

Description[]
One who wished to improve the range and accuracy of slingshots discovered that
Power increases range, but costs accuracy.
So slingshot rocks were replaced with long wooden poles that sported feathers for stability.
The slingshot's limbs were lengthened and the ends recurved to increase pull.
It then dawned on him that he had made a bow.

Description[]
The seven sages of King Deshret have long vanished, their deeds blown away by the winds, leaving behind only their names, carved in stone. Now, even these engravings have been eroded by the winds of time, turning into little more than golden grains of sand.
The right hand of King Deshret, the head of the Seven Sages, the minister of ministers — The Goat King;
The great bird winging skyward towards the sun, the King's soul — The saint Bennu;
The lioness with a human head, the King's will — The saint Shesepankh;
And the dragon who obtained the flesh and blood of the King, who never counted itself among the Seven — Al-Apep.
The four named above have nothing to do with the story that follows.
The Crocodile King and Ibis King were arguing ceaselessly, as ever, and that day the subject of their debate was the changing of things.
The Crocodile King sought a person who possessed mystic arts. That person had been blessed by an Oceanid who was staying there, and any liquid that passed through his hands would transform itself into an exquisite wine, perfectly proportioned.
The Ibis King brought forth another rare being, one who had accidentally touched the tomb and remains of an ancient god, and been cursed. Due to the curse, anything touched by both his hands would slowly become pure silver — after all, from today, we know that transformation into gold and Mora is the sole province of Deus Auri.
The two of them bet on which effect would win out in the end. They also asked Hermanubis — who is the last of the Seven Sages to be mentioned — to make a conjecture as to the eventual result.
Hermanubis was a sage of the desert, and the leader of the priestly class. For this reason, he was both a warrior and a sage. And as the learning known as alchemy was passed down amongst humans, and he was well-versed in its secrets, asking him to judge was eminently reasonable.
"Both forms of power clash directly, as sharp spears striking sturdy shields," spake Hermanubis, "And they must each yield unto the other, and take a step back. This is the principle of equilibrium."
In the end, the final result was that the cup became pure silver, while the silted water within became a fine liquor with suspended grains of silver.
Yet the Crocodile King and Ibis King did not understand Hermanubis's admonishment, instead continuing their battle. In the end, they invented a strange summoning magic. And now, the two of them have traversed millennia to continue their battle upon the field of Genius Invokation TCG...
All of this is part of this version of the story of "King of Invokations."

Description[]
When the verdant city was sealed by cloud and mist,
When the unending snowstorms blotted out the clear moonlight,
When all life and every interrupted story,
Was pierced by that nail that fell from the azure skies...
The priest's daughter gave the Starsilver greatsword to the hero from another land,
In the howling wind and snow, her words could not reach their intended target.
"This fourth fresco is prepared for you. Your likeness will forever remain on this wall."
"For the sake of that fresco, and for everyone, I will wait for you, and pray for your return..."
When the daughter of that snow-entombed city withered together with the grafted yet barren silver branches,
The outlander destined to wield this sword to shatter ice and snow alike was far afield, chasing answers.
Bright as the moonlight though she was, her final words, too, would never reach that wayfarer.
"It's been a while since I last saw the blue sky and green grass. I don't know which hues to use to capture the landscape of thawing ice and snow that my father so longs for."
"I wish I could see you again..."
This was the answer he found—
The hero ended his fruitless journey at last.
Tainted black blood dripped from the blade of his greatsword,
As he trudged through now-foreign snowy paths.
But when he returned to the great hall of that mountain country,
Naught but ringing deathly echoes welcomed him.
"So even here, there is nothing left for me to protect..."
"You who dwell in the heavens, you must wish for naught but to watch our ashen suffering here below."
"In that case, then let me help you pass the time with a song of iron and blood."
The outlander left the Starsilver originally meant to shatter snow and wind alike between the frescoes.
Then, he descended the mountain to search for a land full of war and strife — a place he might paint red with blood.

Trivia[]
The princess' final words are also used in their entirety in the description of the Princess' Box, one of the three boxes obtained in the Hidden Exploration Objective Dragonspine's Last Trio.
The description of "tainted black blood" dripping from his greatsword suggests that Imunlaukr fought with Abyssal creatures. This aligns with the later revelation that the divine nails, one of which caused the snowstorms over Sal Vindagnyr, were cast down by the Heavenly Principles to suppress the power of forbidden knowledge and the Abyss, which had been brought to this world by the Dragon King Nibelung.[1]

Description[]
Rumored to be a legendary sword of Liyue.
It was said its sheath was made with eaglewood, decorated with mica, and engraved with the imagery of war.
This priceless sheath, however, was lost.
To the blade, the sheath was its prison, keeping it from its true purpose.
The blade is so sharp that its victims would only realize they had been struck an hour later.
It is said that Kunwu forged this prized sharp sword in just one day, though he worked all day and all night to do so.
But when Kunwu's aged master saw his apprentice's work, he clenched his fists, sighed in anguish, and beat the ground with his staff.
"O, pitiful is this thing merciless in all the world."
The master let out a final, long sigh, and hobbled away.
Kunwu pondered his master's word for three days, and did not touch a single blade in that time.
Then, he spent a whole year painstakingly carving an eaglewood sheath.
Kunwu thought that an elegant and opulent scabbard would surely suffice to subdue the wildness and violence of the blade.
But then the prized sword was lost among the common folk. The sharp blade survived, and all that remained of the scabbard was its story.
For the sharp blade seeks only to bathe in the blood of its victims, and no sheath can be made that will curb this desire.

Trivia[]
Keqing is seen wielding this sword in her official Character Demo, in her Collected Miscellany and in the cinematic during Archon Quest Turning Point in Chapter I: Act III - A New Star Approaches.
Keqing is also seen wielding the ascended version of this sword in her Genius Invokation TCG Character Card.
Lion's Roar (Chinese: 匣里龙吟 "Dragon's Roar in the Box"), along with another weapon forged by Kunwu, namely Solar Pearl (Chinese: 匣里日月 "Sun and Moon in a Box"), probably drew inspiration from a famous poem 古剑篇 "Tale of the Ancient Sword",[1] which describes the casting of an ancient sword. In the poem, the "box"(匣) is a metaphor of a lotus emerging from a glazed box to describe the sword itself.
The rough translation follows: "Didn't you see Kunwu's gems being refined into swords, in the red fire, with purple flames from the sword's edge? No one knows many years after skillful craftsmen's forging and smelting that this unparalleled sword named Longquan (Dragon's Spring) was casted. Swordsman himself exclaimed proudly, that the sword shone like snow and frost. Like a white lotus spit out from a glazed jade box, the golden ring on the hilt of the sword is dyed with the brilliance of the sun and the moon. This sword was born just when there was no war in the world, so it must be fortunate to be worn by a gentleman for self-defense. The dazzling sword light swims like a green snake, and the pattern on the sheath is like floating green turtle scales. It's not only the rangers who cherish it very much when they see it, but also the heroes. Why keep saying that it was abandoned halfway and fell to the side of the desolate ancient prison? Although the sword is buried in the mud and can't play a role, the extraordinary flame formed by its powerful sword aura still illuminates the night sky every night."

Description[]
In the distant past, when the gods and spirits walked the land,
When all the land was in turmoil, people must have asked such questions...
"Please tell me: where have my lover and children gone?"
"When will those who have departed return to us?"
"O great lord, how long will these horrific times persist?"
Even the hearts of people hewn from the hardest bedrock would crack and break from the pain.
Even the eyes of those who remained silent, stoic in their unswerving faith in their gods, would begin to smolder.
Even if they did not ask such questions, their hearts would make the sounds.
The ruler of Geo thus put forth his might and carved a long blade from a pure slab of golden Cor Lapis.
With a single slice, he cut a corner clean off a mountain, and upon it he swore a most solemn oath to the people—
Those scattered, he would gather — and those who broke the contract, he would punish.
Those who had lost their loved ones, those robbed of their possessions, those deprived of justice — they would receive recompense.
Perhaps this is but one of the many tales that shroud the ancient land of Liyue.
But the solemn oath that Rex Lapis swore is nonetheless at work within it.
To break a contract is to make an enemy of this land where gods once ruled,
And sooner or later, the mountain Rex Lapis cut will fall upon those who break contracts—
A legend still circulates, saying that this weapon's true owner will one day return to walk among mortals.
Then, this sword will once again gleam gold, and its light will cut through the greatest of this world's injustices...
Just as it did when Rex Lapis made his solemn oath before the people.

Description[]
An ancient prototype greatsword from Liyue's arsenal. The batch number has faded and no records exist to confirm the date of production.
Weighing in at close to forty pounds, this weapon's hilt is made from a rare ore, while the blade is forged from the finest steel. All you will see when it is swung are blinding flashes of light, powerful enough to devour the clouds and blot out the moon.
After the great disaster, the Yun family forge joined forces with the master craftsman Han Wu to find a way to push past the constraints of contemporary blade design and revolutionize their craft.
Thus was born a new series of weapon models, simply named "the prototypes." The first greatsword built using the new design was unusually understated in its final appearance. The underwhelming sight of dull, blotchy gold masked the weapon's true strength. While not much to look at, any who cared to try it would discover that it was weighty but not unwieldy.
Han Wu, the master craftsman who forged the weapon, traveled north through the night to hand the sword over to a martial artist who followed the chivalric code.
The martial artist inspected the blade closely before trialing it. The blade howled like the wind and in an instant decimated the entire bamboo forest. It was a rare sight to behold.
The martial artist said to Han Wu, "This blade is endowed with the elegance of antiquity. It is of equal value both as a weapon and an ornament."
"Such a fine creation possessed of both scale and subtlety is worthy of a name like no other. May it be known as Archaic."[Note 1]
Due to its unparalleled strength, this sword subsequently became the model for thousands of greatswords in Liyue.

A long time ago, in a place far, far away... Tragedy struck.
Brothers took to arms against one another.
One among them was a great archer. After suffering a humiliating defeat, he made a vow:
"Until I have brought down my enemies,"
"Until I have pierced their throats and their blood has run dry, I shall not clean my feet."
And so, the great archer fell prey to a foot infection.

Sure enough, he became untouchable.
Be it swords, be it spears, or be it rain of arrows,
He laughed and shrugged them off.
Eventually, his foes learned:
He had borne his prized greatsword on his back as he bathed
And now, his back bore a great weak spot, the very shape and size of that sword.

Trivia[]
Diluc is seen wielding this greatsword in his wish art.
The lore for this weapon is based on the legend of the Norse and Germanic mythological figure Sigurd (Siegfried), whose body became nigh-invulnerable after bathing in the dragon Fafnir's blood, with the exception of one part. His enemies later take advantage of that to murder him.

Description[]
Legend has it that a thousand years ago, in the era when the foolish king was buried beneath the dunes,
Many short-lived city-states were scattered throughout the barren, boundless, gilded land.
This greatsword belongs to the dancer Makhaira, who was once the tyrant's concubine.
With her ruthless sword dance, she won the king's favor as well as the prince's attention.
The noble king of the decaying kingdom was obese and haughty, reveling in gourmet food, wine, and hunting all day and every day.
No different from any other kings of that decadent age, he indulged himself in endless conquest, destruction, and the hoarding of loot.
When all things sank into the dark night, the water-colored moonlight soothed the manic kingdom, and everything there fell asleep,
The overweight tyrant could not bear the torpor and fell into a deep slumber amidst the misty voices of the Seelie, his snores echoing throughout his chambers like rolling thunder...
The enchanting concubine had already seen the signs of destruction, so she polished her sword and prepared for one final dance.
The young prince had already foreseen the signs of devastation, so he came to meet the distraught Makhaira at night.
"What comes from the searing sands will eventually be buried beneath them. Even if the desert is as cold as ice on long nights, its fiery fate shall never be forgotten."
"If this is your decision, then please do me a favor, and please allow me to contribute but a little something to this old country that has long since fallen."
"Just a little revenge shall remove the burden on both our hearts. The one addicted to hunting shall finally be executed by the falcon he spoils."
"My mother, a Jinni, taught me the seven-fold sword dance. If I win the throne for you, I shall no longer have to flatter others, and that will satisfy me."
The conspiracy to bring down the kingdom was thus drawn up on the bed-mattress, and the gentle words of the lovers were also sharp blades.
The tyrant thus returned to the land of searing sands in an ugly fashion, and the great cause of conquering kingdoms and harems finally vanished into thin air.
The rise and fall of the city-state were but a drunken dream, during which the kind and the evil alike were crushed by an immense millstone like wheat husks.
The concubine adept at her sword-dancing failed to become the queen in the end, and the wise old retainer who survived to tell the story too lost his eyes.
The displaced, thrown into the sea of sand by the whirlpool that consumed everything, became wanderers or mercenaries before being engulfed by the forest...

Description[]
"Umbrellas from Inazuma are more like unique pieces of artistry than something to shield oneself from the rain. Whether it be the design of the bamboo handle, the patterns on its surface, or the colors of the oil paper beneath beads of water, the umbrella looks in every way exquisite and delicate. Each time I pass through an alley and see such an umbrella outside a store, I often find my thoughts drifting back to a certain event. Rumor has it that there once was an umbrella that sent the whole town aflutter with activity. Here's how the story goes:"
"Hundreds of years ago, during the season of a grand festival, the flowers were in bloom, the foxes were at play, and even the typically stoic Tengu mingled amongst the people. Yet, the most eye-catching oddity was a girl bearing an intricate umbrella while sipping the fine wine of the Oni Clan. As she grew inspired, the young maiden danced like billowing flowers amidst the snow as the moonlight poured down on her. All who beheld her found themselves cheering her on, be they human or youkai. But with the passage of time, the girl went to war with the army and met a most untimely fate. With her passing, her cherished umbrella was offered to a shrine by her loyal subordinates."
"A daughter to a prominent martial family encountered the umbrella when offering her prayers at a shrine. Hence, she decided to purchase it at full price. The next day, with the skies wet with rain, the girl wanted to seize the opportunity and venture out with her umbrella. However, before she could even get changed, a message was delivered from afar, informing her of her husband's death in battle. Consumed by grief, the girl fell ill and left this mortal plane to seek her lover within the stretch of days. After her funeral, her parents regarded the umbrella she bought as something of a cursed object and returned it to the shrine to be sealed away."
"Yet, after a few months, new rumors spread. People would claim that, on rainy nights, a previously unknown youkai would stalk the streets. The way the youkai was illustrated made it sound akin to an umbrella, except taller than a man, bearing a single eye, a single leg, and also a long tongue. Should someone walk alone at night, the youkai may just suddenly appear, using its long tongue to lick those that dare pass by. From the perspective of those who live in Fontaine, the youkai presented little threat with its main acts seeming like pranks. That said, few people actually knew what the youkai's true intentions were. This engendered a sense of worry amongst the people who walked the streets. Young maidens dared not to leave home. The elderly sighed, saying if the wise and powerful were not absent, dealing with this youkai would be a trifling thing. At that moment, however, few even knew how to exorcise such a simple being."
"Later, when a young Shrine Maiden caught wind of what happened, she took the umbrella out from the shrine, and washed it from the tip down using a wooden spoon. As she used a silk cloth to wipe its surface, she said this:"
"'Even should the rains of yesterday cease, tomorrow and the day after remain. If that noble were still alive, your present state would surely be held unacceptable!'"
"Hence, she had the umbrella enshrined in an annex of the temple. Since then, none have heard either hint or whisper regarding this umbrella again."
"Now, I heard this story from a friend of mine in Inazuma, although I did go around investigating the shrines around Narukami and found no mention of the umbrella being enshrined. When I told this to my friend, she just laughed:"
"'Truly, Mademoiselle Leucade, do you take these kaidan to be the truth?'"

Description[]
The polearm is a powerful weapon even in the hands of the unskilled, because "the longer, the mightier."
Adding an axe on the tip renders it somewhat unwieldy, but adds slash capabilities. This makes it better suited to complex battle scenarios.
The axe-mounted polearm — the halberd — is preferred by warriors of great strength. It has also come to symbolize the honor and bravery of Millelith officers.
Though peace prevails in the Liyue Harbor of today, the sight of brave warriors with halberd in hand is a ubiquitous one on the city streets.
Each Millelith squad was led by an officer who would fearlessly charge ahead. They were the first line of defense for their comrades in dangerous territory.
But it was not through bravery, loyalty, and self-sacrifice alone that they were able to protect their comrades. For they were also formidable fighters, their skills honed over years and years of drilling.
Any foe who dared approach knew that the sight of the halberd-holding officers of the front line spelled almost certain doom for them.
And when the soldiers of the Millelith assumed a tactical formation, it was the cornerstone of their fearless officers that made them impenetrable as a rock formation.

Description[]
A spine that holds up the sky.
The true companion of the Anemo Archon never wavered in its desire to protect the land of wind.
This unshakeable resolve sustained the wind dragon through its mortal battle against its vile nemesis.
In olden times, the shadow dragon Durin, covetous of the peace Mondstadt enjoyed, came forth to defile the land.
Durin's black wings blotted out the sky, releasing clouds of toxic fumes,
So much so that even the thousand winds could not hold their pestilence and rot at bay,
And thus fell black rain from the skies, the din of their downpour drowning the cries and groans of the people.
The Anemo Archon was awakened by the sound of their agony, and his heart was pierced by their despair.
So he summoned Dvalin to his side, and shrouding themselves in storm, they pierced through the poisoned skies.
The great dragon plunged in with a cry, tearing a swathe through the noxious nimbus the shadow dragon had created.
Following his wings came a great, swift whirlwind that destroyed those venomous clouds.
Dvalin seized the poisonous dragon in his mighty claws, ascending to heights that even clouds could not fathom.
The poisonous rain had scattered as the clouds had been left behind, and the burning skies became the dragons' battleground.
At last the wind dragon's razor fangs pierced his foe's throat, and his great claws tore out its corrupted heart.
The sinners' creation, filled with eternal regret, fell from the spotless skies and fell to ruin upon a snowy peak.
That fierce battle in the distant skies had thus defended the people of the Anemo Archon.
But at the moment of his triumph, the venomous ichor of his foe had flowed between his teeth and into his guts.
The pain withered bone and marrow, and in his agony the great wind dragon curled up in the depths of an ancient ruin.
...Nursing his wounds, Dvalin still believed that one day, he would be reawakened.
He would again pierce the heavens, scatter the darkness, and sing to the sounds of the lyre of the Anemo Archon, his dear friend.

Description[]
A reliable and balanced sword made of fine steel.
The one downside is that the partial-tang design renders it less durable than its full-tang counterparts.
That said, the partial tang creates space in the hilt for hidden knives, scissors, tinder, and other objects.
Hence the name, Traveler's Handy Sword. It contains all sorts of handy items for travelers.

Description[]
By the time Rex Lapis arrived, the ancestors of the people of Chenyu Vale had long since regressed into tribes scattered amongst the hills.
Carving jade as pure as fresh water, and conducting festivals in solemn accord with their ancient traditions,
Waiting for an auspicious day, the tribespeople would cease their onerous labors, and sacrifice their beautiful jade, throwing it into the water as obeisance...
Commemorating the long-silent messengers of the cerulean sky, and looking forward to the blessings and disasters of the coming year.
When the ancient god who once ruled Chenyu Vale had perished in foreign lands, and Rex Lapis's order assumed control of the land,
Those ancient forebears amidst their mountainous wilds slowly accepted the civilization of Liyue, but retained the tradition of offering sacrifices.
With the passing of long years, even the hardest rocks will be eroded by the gentle flow of water into round stones, and the ancient customs of the locals were accepted by the new migrants from Liyue,
And thus, this place has developed different social customs from Liyue Harbor, and the people have a gentle nature different from those of Liyue Harbor.
As the endless years passed and seasons turned, the ancestral forebears and their tribes mingled and fused with the newcomers to become new clans and settlements...
Having lost the ancient art of carving those jade ornaments, in the new era, tea is grown, and tea fields are now spread across Chenyu Vale.
Though the people of Chenyu Vale no longer toss jade ornaments, clear like pure water, into the eternally flowing rivers as sacrifices,
The ceremony of going to Yilong Wharf to commemorate the ancestors and the dead has survived to this day, like gem-bright jade in a clear mountain stream.
Sometimes, herb gatherers will still find blueish-green Yilong jade in the ruins among the mountains and valleys,
Though it no longer responds to the ancient heavens, it still shines brightly with the light of this world.
The silent jade itself has never told that ancient history of their ancestors' hardships and wanderings,
All the puzzles of the past are left merely waiting for those who accidentally pick them up, to guess and imagine.

Description[]
A strangely-shaped spear made by Kitain Bunsou for his own unique style of spearmanship.
Its massive weight makes it extremely unwieldy in untrained hands.
But in the hands of an expert, it is capable of unleashing great destructive power.
In the distant past, Kitain used to be a family that hunted the Tatarigami down.
For many generations, they shouldered the responsibility of serving as the Prefects of Yashiori.
In the past, there was a certain children's song that circulated widely within Inazuma:
"Arataki of the Front Gate, Iwakura the Successor, Kitain the Serpent, Takamine the Mistsplitter."
These phrases describe the dazzling warriors who once illuminated the earth like comets.
There used to be many other names on the list, but they have since been lost to history.
And having been a demon hunter for so long, it is unavoidable that one might imbibe some of that miasmic, tainted blood.

Trivia[]
The spear is most likely a reference to cross spears used by the Houzouin-ryuu, a Japanese martial art school founded by Houzouin In'ei, a warrior monk who is said to have invented this type of spears.
Thoma is seen wielding the ascended version of this polearm in his official art. He is also seen wielding its base version in his Character Card in Genius Invokation TCG.

Description[]
A beauteous item fashioned from rare natural glaze.
Legend has it that the Eye of Perception was once upon a time as bright, clear, and smooth as a lake's surface, but became dulled over the passage of many years.
Folk records claim that on a still night, one can hear it make soft noises.
Sometimes it sounds like a mild breeze, other times like a flowering spring.
They say that the Eye was an adeptus's heirloom that was passed down in Liyue and eventually found its way into the Yun family.[Translation Note 1]
Now one day, Yun was strolling about in the mountains, and there they happened to meet an exorcist named Huang, who had come to consult with the adepti.
Yun spoke with Huang enthusiastically and at length, gifted the Eye to Huang. When Huang frantically declined, Yun said this with a smile:
"This pearl is nature's very quintessence. Only one whose heart is clear can use it."
Thanking Yun, Huang took the Eye and wore it on his person, and slowly made his way towards Liyue. Along the way, neither rain nor wind impeded him.
As one who sought after the path of the adepti, Huang wandered the land without rest. Thus, he would often be at the market to buy water and food.
The harbor-side streets were a morass of humanity. Yet Huang walked among them as if idle, and was never taken advantage of. Some were curious: how could this bookish exorcist take to the city like a fish to water, and never miss a step?
When asked, he replied: "This Eye trembles at wickedness, and helps me see which hearts are true."
This Eye could reveal human hearts, though no one knows how it worked, causing many to fall back on folktales to explain it.
Some say that at midnight, you can dimly hear it call out like a mild breeze, or like spring water flowing between scattered stones.
Both are reminiscent of the murmuring of demons that feed on wicked thoughts, a common feature of the parables once told by mothers to their children in days long gone.

Mona is seen wielding this catalyst in Collected Miscellany - "Mona: Stellaris Phantasm" | Genshin Impact
Translation Notes[]
↑ In the original Chinese description, it is a relic of an adeptus clan/[philosophical] school (Chinese: 仙家 xianjiā); notably, the Chinese term typically translated as adeptus/adepti is 仙人 xianrén. Furthermore, it was not so much passed down in Liyue so much as it was sold in Liyue's marketplace, which is how it fell into the Yun family's hands.

Description[]
"People come and go in such haste, like dreams that stay in the night and leave in the morning."
This simple and ordinary life...
Yes, I think I've lived it to the full.
I was once the Hakushin Kitsune.
With my agile and loveable comrades,
I dashed across the mountains and plains of Narukami.
Hopefully, when everything is over,
They can run happily once more...
I once met an oni maiden with a face as lovely as the moon.
Together, we performed and played divine music before the throne,
And I could not help but applaud her sword dance.
I hope her beauty, bravery, and bearing,
Shall be praised by people for thousands of years to come.
At the thought of her unrivaled beauty,
I cannot help wanting to hide my current appearance with a mask...
I once got into a race with the chieftain of the Yougou Tengu,
And we sprinted through all the courses and paths of the spirit mountains, both within it and around it.
In this great contest of speed and strength,
I, born of the Hakushin Clan, was the eventual victor.
Now that I think about it, she must have let me off easy.
The very thought of it makes me feel a little unsatisfied...
I once schemed against a bake-danuki who persistently challenged me,
And I made him surrender to the Shogun completely.
I also shamelessly schemed against the Shogun,
And I made her put the great bake-danuki under her command.
That night, the moonlight swept the imperial garden, through branch and petal,
Showering the courtyard with pearls from heaven.
That scene still glows brightly in my shallow heart...
I hope she can remember the wordy motto I dared to put to her ere we parted.
"Do not be blinded. Do not waver. Keep walking on the path you believe in."
I hope that my words will ward off at least some of the lies and evil she will face.
I also hope that that mischievous yet innocent tanuki will not hate me for my final deception...
Now, in this darkest of places,
I will hold tightly to these scenes,
And like the moon shining through the clouds,
They will light up my tiny, fragile heart.
In this life, I once took the form of a human,
And I walked with these short-lived yet beautiful little creatures,
And became friends with many people from all walks of life.
Whether it was the shrine maiden who came to train in Narukami for the sake of her hometown shrine,
Or the kid who got separated from the adults by the divine palanquin's entourage during the summer festival,
Or the easygoing young man who finally went to Liyue to practice the adepti arts...
Whether it's the Kanjou who worked hard to make the city prosperous,
Or the craftsman who was obsessed with making extremely sharp swords,
Or the clan who used ingenious techniques to make man-made meteors bloom in the skies...
All of them are friends whom I did not expect to make.
I hope the barrier that guards them will not be eroded by any darkness...
Everything, all of this — they are all things that I yearn for.
"So then, the dark will that gnaws at me..."
"Now that I've lost all my strength,"
"My Hakushin blood is yours to do with as you will."
"However, despite being greatly humbled as I am,"
"I still pray that you will listen to my pleas..."
"If you can see everything that I treasure,"
"Then I beg pardon on behalf of those beings."
"If you would permit me to make but one wish,"
"Please return my ever-bright memory,"
"To this land that I love deeply."
"That way, that even after your rampage,"
"I may still hold out hope for beautiful things to endure..."

Trivia[]
The weapon may be inspired by the orb Nyoi Houju (Japanese: 如意宝珠 "As-One-Wishes Jewel"; Sanskrit: चिंतामणि Cintāmaṇi, "Wish-Fulfilling Gem") held by the left hand of Hindu/Buddhist goddess Dakini in the iconography of Japanese Buddhism. She is also known as the Byakusin-Ko'ou or Hakushin-Ko'ou ("White-Dawn Fox-Queen") in Japan and has been equated with the agricultural deity Inari in Shinto, who is commonly depicted as a fox woman in folk tales and popular culture.

Description[]
The favored barbed spear of a famous Inazuman bandit.
It was originally a harpoon used to catch fish, but it was also very handy in battle.
They say that he even pierced the enchanted, sword-armed puppet before carrying it off.
"Haha! Once, I was the master of this ship, the 'Seiraimaru.'"
"I commanded over ten ships, and they called me the Deathless Oni of Seirai."
"Now, I am but a leaf floating upon the waves."
"If not for Janome and the people marooned on those islands,"
"Forget raising our sails again — I doubt I would have managed to make it back to my home shores."
"And yet Seirai now looks like this."
"There is no longer any place for me in the Inazuman Islands."
"Even that naggy, fretful old shrine maiden is gone..."
The bandit named Ako Domeki's voice was thick with emotion. Then he said...
"Hey, Janome! I'm now the freest man in the whole wide world!"
"Aunt Shrine Maiden! Didn't you say that you wanted to go see the world?"
"You know, go someplace else, like that Kamuna guy or that Konbumaru you always talk about?"
"You know what? Let me, Ako Domeki Zaemon, go in your stead!"
"Let me go see what the edge of the world really looks like!"
"We'll meet again where all ship routes end!"[Note 1]
"And when we do, it'll be my turn to tell you all about these distant lands!"
Lore[]
"The Catch" was originally wielded by Ako Domeki.

Gameplay Notes[]
The passive effect adds an extra Physical hit after each Attack hit, as opposed to increasing the character's Normal and Charged Attack DMG.
For most builds, the additional hit deals significantly more damage than additional Attack DMG would: since the hit scales of Physical DMG Bonuses, its additional damage (before accounting for enemy DEF and Physical RES) is equal to:
(ATK × PassiveDMG%) × (1 + PhysicalDMGBonus%)
(The additional hit does not count as a Normal or Charged Attack, so it does not scale from effects that increase Attack or Charged Attack DMG.)
For comparison, an increase to Attack DMG would increase damage by:
(ATK × TalentDMG%) × PassiveDMG%
Also note that the damage applies after each hit of multi-hit attacks, which are common on Polearm characters.
Description[]
The whole world flocks to the commercial port of Liyue, much to the city's pride.
With the tides of people also come exotic treasures.
This spearhead is long and narrow like a needle, with a crescent-shaped blade extending from its base.
Once the bearer has grasped its elusive design concept, this weapon becomes far more destructive than its counterparts.
Unlike the martial artists of Liyue, those from other lands are masters of the art of surprise, skilled at developing ingenious new tricks.
This weapon is designed to exploit fatal flaws. Like a needle, it slips between the gaps in an opponent's armor. Like the powers of music and love, it finds its way past people's defenses.
The designer of the Crescent Pike was said to be able to visualize the fatal flaws in life itself.
As if drawn by some mystical power, the pike would fly from her hand toward her opponents' fatal flaws.
"Perhaps all that lives waits willingly for death."
So thought the designer, who could see that which was fatally undefended in each living thing, yet had no such fatal flaws in her own life.
Then she found music, and through music found love. And in love, she found her own fatal flaw.
In the end, the pain of finality, which pierced her heart like a needle, finally brought the witch to a realization:
"Fatal flaws are born of a fear of death. Fear of death is born of having things, and people, to care about."
"Oh, how I wish to see him but one more time, that thief who can neither be caught nor killed."
"Oh, how I wish to hear his song but one more time. If I should survive, I shall certainly treat him—"

Description[]
Legend has it that a hero who fell into the abyss left this strange bow behind, the body of which shines brightly like pearls and secret silver.
The tint of the string is like the blackest seas or the lightless void, and it is as silent as empty vacuum.
In the grand days of old, golems formed an army and fought against the dragons in the depths of the sea.
The dragons, born of the sea, were a brutal race ruled by a King named Scylla,
At that time, the Dragon King Scylla recruited a horde of barbarians and vishaps, driving them toward the threshold of the ancient nation,
And the bow-wielding army moved forward to intercept and resist them, until the great Harmost sealed away Scylla's power...
Afterwards, the once-glorious kingdom became nothing more than a bed of ruins scattered across the seafloor,
But the remnants of the golem army continued fighting the descendants of the dragons in places the sunlight couldn't reach...
The still deeps had never been perturbed by bloody battle, but its petrified heart gradually began to collapse.
The last archer and the lone descendant of the dragon eventually reached a peace agreement.
The endless clash of tooth and nail had grown vexing,
And so sword and bow would no longer draw any gaze in the lightless abyss.
The knights of the lost nation and the vishap warriors could not help but burst out laughing,
Discarding their burdensome weapons, as if finally freed from a meaningless blood-feud...
As for what later happened in the stillness beneath the ocean depths, it was interpreted and re-interpreted by countless operas, far into the future.
Some say that both betrayed each of their homelands, and built new settlements for exiles...
Like this ancient, magnificent bow, many stories eventually sink into the still, silent deeps, becoming naught but fanciful legends.
"Savagery" at last had mastery over the former lands of the kingdom, and many stories and songs are now little more than harmless, fictional dramas...

Description[]
"There is an appointed time for all things to live and die, just like the ceaseless cycles of night and dawn."
"May the stories within this lamp grant you dreams worth looking forward to."
At the moment the palace crumbled, the girl who had never known "light" heard her whisper inside a dream.
Through the mist of tears, the child who had long decided to depart in dreams caught sight of her gentle benevolence.
In the reflection of the serene moonlight, the verdant lamp told of the silhouette of the stars and an everlasting melody—
A dancer with emerald eyes planting light kisses onto silk dripping with nectar, brightly colored fish pirouetting in pearly clear waters,
A moonlight musician guiding the Jinn's torches, singing songs of the gilded fortress in a sea of sand and pomegranate-colored strings,
An astute sailor setting off on a grand voyage, seeking nothing else but the singing voice from a dream and the blooming gardens on the far shore.
The fallen palace illuminated by silent night, encircled by breathtaking dreamscapes from a thousand worlds,
The soft forest breeze clearing away the dust gathered on the homeward path, guiding lost children away from the palace, no longer tranquil as it had been.
As the dawning light filtered through fragmented spaces between leaves, that verdant lamp which had told stories of a thousand nights' dreams began to fade:
It was only when she looked back, standing between dreams and reality, that the blind girl realized that there was no return, for dawn had broken.
Thereafter, the lamp inside the dream never flickered again, and the flow of time swallowed up the dreams of bygone nights,
But the birds still sang as they embraced the break of dawn. They sang of the stories that blossomed brilliantly like a field of flowers,
Bringing courage, hope, and happiness to the children who had never had the chance to witness a dream,
Weaving a never-ending song of a thousand nights, lighting up the moments before the long-awaited daybreak.
After traversing a thousand dreams, until the nightingale no longer sang, until the fading sun fell beneath the horizon once again,
The traveler saw at journey's end that verdant lamp, that faraway homeland of old,
Where the dew-colored rose still swayed softly in the moonlit breeze, waiting for her to tell a new story:
"Though the memories of past nights have all but faded, we shall continue to sing songs of praise for the sweet dreams that have yet to unfold."

Description[]
This was a story from long ago...
Unborn life, unfulfilled wishes,
Tragic dreams at the edge of the universal darkness that could never come true,
Indwell my body, and descend unto this world.
Then, my lovely children,
Like rainwater flowing into creeks, and plants growing towards
the sun,
Go unto a lovely place, and display your own beauty there with pride.
This is a memory, a memory that a child named Durin had of his mother...
"Thank you, Mother, thank you."
"You gave me wings to soar and a mighty form."
"Mother, I wish to go to a land of lovely songs,"
"I will tell them about you, Mother, and about everyone else."
"I shall tell them that the place where I was born is beautiful."

Trivia[]
This weapon's lore ties into the lore of Dragonspine Spear since both weapons are made from the remains of Durin.
This sword was the main focus of the Event The Chalk Prince and the Dragon:
According to Albedo's dialogue in Festering Desire, this sword was created by a blacksmith who disappeared shortly after its creation, with the weapon being lost to time and eventually ending up in the Treasure Hoarders' possessions. When stolen goods were reclaimed from a group of Treasure Hoarders by the Knights of Favonius, this sword was rediscovered.As no one came to claim it, Albedo investigated the sword and discovered its true origins: the sword's blade had been coated with a powder made of Durin's remains, notably his eyes, claws, and scales. This infused the weapon with Durin's power but also its corruption, cursing the sword and making it unusable by "ordinary mortals," as the corruption might seep through the handle and infect the body of the wielder; Albedo goes as far as considering the sword as "a living being" and theorizing that this curse might be the reason behind its creator's mysterious fate.The Traveler is unaffected by the curse as they have the ability to purify corrupted items, as demonstrated when they purified Dvalin's tears, hence why Albedo entrusts the sword to them for experimentation.
The sword is eventually cleaned of its corruption by the end of Raiders Amidst Snow Mist thanks to the Traveler purifying it over time, although some of its sheer power is lost when it is transferred by accident into the Resurgent Cryo Regisvine during Uninvited Guests. Albedo extracts the rest into a bottle during Afterword, gifting the now safe sword to the Traveler as a memento of their research.
During this event, the sword could grant various unlockable boosts when used in Dragonspine and also received a ×1.5 Refinement EXP boost.

Description[]
All knew the falcon's protection was a blessing of Favonius,
Few knew the blessing of Favonius was from a distant tribe.
Under the tyranny of the old nobles, Mondstadt cried for freedom.
Enslaved was the exiled foreign fighter in the land of the wind.
Yet she knelt not before injustice and deception, but set a shining example.
For she overthrew the barbaric nobles and established a chivalric order and the Church.
Blessed was she to eventually walk with the gods.
This was the sword that witnessed all her hardships and feats.
A testament to her achievement in spreading justice across Mondstadt.
You can feel her unrelenting spirit when swinging this sword:
Justice for the pressed.
Freedom for the shackled.
Wisdom for the deceived.
Let the wind of justice and freedom lead.

Trivia[]
Aquila Favonia is Latin for the "Eagle of the West Wind," which is the most natural interpretation for 西风之鹰/西風之鷹 Xīfēng zhī Yīng, one of Vennessa's titles in the original Chinese version, whose official English translation is the "Falcon of the West." See Vennessa#Trivia for details.

↑ Chinese: The bird 鹰/鷹 yīng chiefly means predatory birds of the Accipitridae family (including eagles, hawks, and harriers), while it can also mean falcons in its broadest sense. See Vennessa#Trivia for details.
↑ Japanese: Unlike its original Traditional Chinese character 鷹 yīng, "Accipitridae," the kanji 鷹 almost always means "hawk" in Japanese.
↑ Korean: 매 Mae does not distinguish falcons from hawks in its casual usage. In modern Korean, it usually means a falcon (specifically, the peregrine falcon), while a hawk (specifically, the northern goshawk) is called 참매 chammae, literally meaning "true mae," when a strict distinction is needed.

Description[]
A once-popular tool during the days when Fontaine was more dependent on manual labor.
The blade might not have been strong enough for prolonged, intense use,
But it made up for this by allowing the blunt section to be broken off at the user's convenience.
Dock workers often used it to cut through thin materials and untie knotted cables.
Although the use of this type of weapon was always heavily regulated and no blade never truly belonged to the user,
It was widely circulated under the tables, and was once hailed as the blade of the people.
It was perfect for self-preservation in less friendly natural environments, as well as for cutting paths through aquatic plants.
Legend has it that many people also discovered new uses for it during the purge.
As society advanced and more regulations were put into place, this type of blade gradually ceased to appear in public.
Although such blades were not owned by their wielders,
Those who depended on them saw them as extensions of their limbs,
And so they often inscribed their names onto the hilts and blades to avoid losing them.
The name inscribed on this blade belongs to one of Poisson's former mayors.

Gameplay Notes[]
Expected CRIT Rate from Royal Series weapons
Description[]
A lance once kept in the collection of a noble who ruled over Mondstadt. A product of premium materials and masterful artisanship.
For that reason, it remains sharp as it was on the day it was first forged, even many generations after the nobles' time ended.
But back in the era of the nobility, this weapon never saw the light of day, and bathed only in the pale moonlight.
The nobles believed that those of high blood should use swords in battle.
To them, the sound of blades clashing was the chorus the lofty souls.
The spear and the bow, on the other hand, were the weapons of plebian gladiators and commoners.
Commoners with pitchforks and sharpened wooden poles, after all, could yet be a match for sword-wielding scions of nobility.
This was, undoubtedly, a hard pill for the rulers of Old Mondstadt to swallow.
Legend has it that there was also a youth of noble stock,
Who sought out a smith to make this weapon, emblazoned with their house's crest,
And yet which, like this youth, could never earn the favor of his family...
No, not without the spilling of blood.
If that youth wanted change to come, they needed power.
Even if it meant using a weapon seen as ignoble.
Even if it meant that their spear-wielding shadow could never see any light but that of the deep night's moon.

Description[]
"In truth, the moon did not always look like a pearl..."
That was a story from a long, long time ago — a dreadful story. Fortunately, it is just a story — not some memory of mine or yours.
Once upon a time, the moon turned into the shape of fangs that smirked ferociously. Moonlight no longer waltzed through the leaves to cast itself onto the grass, turning the dew into glimmering pearls.
Trees were thrust down to the ground like wheat overwhelmed by strong winds. Every inch of the land was swamped by grief.
The grief was so formidably immense and intense that even the streams were fraught with the pungent odor of salt and iron.
Our creator, Queen Aranyani, trusted us with the forest. We thus embarked upon the battles against the monsters that emerged from the darkness, colossi made of iron and steel, and Marana.
She entered the desert with the forest's children. They burnt the roots of disaster and tore the branches of calamity, but only a few of them eventually made it back to the embrace of the shade of trees.
We lost Vanarana, and too many Aranara returned to the ground before their time. Even the story that survived was bitter and agonizing.
But we defeated the calamity in the end. Even in the deepest sea of sand, the lotuses still bloomed.
She who created us had once again created new life to mend the land's hollowed heart.
Courage and strength still ring out amidst the most bitter of tales. No story is as powerful as "memories," but they empower nevertheless.
I will cherish the stories you handed to me, stories of our adventure. Should calamity ever recur and the moon mutate, these stories will protect the forest on your behalf.

Refinement[]
Refining Sword of Narzissenkreuz requires Surging Sacred Chalice instead of an identical weapon.
Description[]
Travels are full of meetings and partings.
Perhaps the only trusty and inseparable companions of a Traveler,
Are the sword in their hand and the dream in their heart.
Before growing old, the eternal Traveler shall pass through many worlds.
Leaving behind naught but stories beyond count and a slightly brighter future.
Lore[]
The Sword of Narzissenkreuz was a ceremonial sword used by the Narzissenkreuz Ordo in a ritual to separate the mind from the body. It has been notably used by Narzissenkreuz himself to grant a certain hilichurl intelligence by those means. The swords very existence can be considered a hypothetical "vision," in that its constituent elements are based entirely on ancient philosophies concerning the soul. Through unknown means, the Narzissenkreuz Ordo was able to recreate these elements of the soul in the material world- these "elements" being Memory, Wish, Soul and Persona (each of which was sealed in their respective Orthant). The fusion of these elements is "reason" to the Ordo, and it can henceforth cut or unite any "will of water." According to Caterpillar, the Sword of Narzissenkreuz can also be any object that holds "reason."

Description[]
A chainsaw favored by workers of the past to cut through keels and pipes.
Its simple and sturdy structure made maintenance and swapping parts a breeze.
Grab the handle tightly with both hands, and even hard steel will be split before you.
This all-powerful tool was once the hallmark of progress.
As the urban areas of Fontaine grew, the light of order drove away the shadows.
It was largely due to this convenient tool that the sewers eventually became the Fleuve Cendre.
The people of the Fleuve Cendre believed that, though they lived in a city below the city with neither rain nor sun,
The workers' abundant diligence and tenacity occasionally won them the right to live on the surface,
And at other times turned their underground watery realm into a residence just as beautiful as the world above.
Unlike dock swords and exploration drills, these chainsaws were not banned.
This was because such chainsaws played an irreplaceable role in the early production of clockwork meka.
Later on, a massive clockwork meka factory was constructed in an absolutely safe area outside the city,
And those who could skillfully utilize these saws were gradually washed away alongside their weapons by the torrent of progress.

Refining Windblume Ode requires "The Visible Winds" instead of an identical weapon. 4 "The Visible Winds" can be obtained through Invitation of Windblume's event shop.
Description[]
In the childhood dreams of Mondstadt, there was a certain breed of floaty flower,
That would grow lushly even amidst the mighty winds, terrible winters and wild whipping ice.
It was unlike ordinary plants, which would be blown away, roots and all, when struck by the powerful gales.
Indeed, this "Windblume"'s roots would grow stronger even as the wind grew wilder.
Today, the rebellion of ordinary mortals against tyranny has long been consigned to festive jests,
And the shape of that flower has grown faint, melding into the lilting lyre-tines of histories long gone by.
"Let me give you this nameless flower, and may the spring-times you never saw mean nothing to you."
"Pray repay me with hope and a smile, and stand with me to welcome the day when the storms blow no longer."
In the days when a tyrant gazed down upon the common folk from his tower, those who nursed freedom in their breasts would greet each other thusly.
Those who sought courage and dreamed of walking upright wove the unknown, using this as their secret sign.
In those days, a lonely and fragile flower would come into bloom with the wind before slowly blossoming all across the wild mountain ranges.
So too did rootless and indifferent subjects content to go with the flow become proud, fearless heroes.
The frowning lord in the tower grew ever lesser in stature, and could no longer disperse the swelling, raging tide.
"Let me give you this nameless flower, and may she crown us champions, defenders of spring and sky."
"May the dawn be our spirit and follow us into the winds of true freedom."
Atop the ruins of the ancient tower, amidst the cheers, songs, and tears of those who had newly won their freedom.
A red-haired warrior turned his back on the newborn god, hidden like a single raindrop in a tidal wave of humanity.
He was first among those who passed the secret sign of Windblume, the one who wove threads of dawn throughout the long night.
His name has since been lost to time, but his deeds are still remembered in song.
A thousand years later, another red-haired knight would follow in his footsteps, and bring light to the then-benighted history of the nobility.
Just as the fate of the Windblume is to bloom under great pressure when the need to arise is most desperate,
The fate of this clan will likely never change: they shall ever live in the darkness and bring forth the flame of dawn.
The shape of the Windblume has been lost amidst the flowing winds of time.
In times of peace, its name has become synonymous with love and gladness.
But surely, this must have been the desire of those who walked stalwartly through the darkness...
"The flowers in bloom should represent love, and stand for the coming of spring."
"No more should they signal for rebellion, nor be the sign for banners to be raised..."

Description[]
Discarded components washed into the gutters can be used as a weapon in a dire emergency.
This one's first opponent was just a monster nourished by "richly nutritious water."
But in any case, it broke the knees and jaws of countless "livestock."
Because it sent so many who threatened his countrymen into the grey river which embraces all,
In Eduardo's hands, it was affectionately called the "Ferryman."
The endpoint of improving the city of Fontaine was for the sewers to become an undercity beneath the city.
Naturally, it was not the bureaucracy of the Court of Fontaine which could maintain order in the Fleuve Cendre.
So in the days that followed, the outlaw leader began his rise by picking up a bronze pipe to beat back the crocodiles,
And then to protect the merchants from being extorted, harassed, and blackmailed by the gangs,
Resolving the disputes between Fleuve Cendre "compatriots," and blessing the newly wedded.
Till at last, it was said, "Let all that the sun shines upon belong to them, and let the Fleuve Cendre belong to us."
But there is no end to improvement.
The positions of the people cannot be changed, but the coordinates of those positions can be changed for that purpose.
And from a certain perspective, there is no difference between "them " and "us,"
Merely places which may be developed, and trash which should be disposed of or "moved."
Eduardo was among those arrested resisting the purge of the Fleuve Cendre, and while being escorted to exile in the desert,
He was rescued by his henchmen. Banding together with comrades active near Mont Automnequi, they occupied Poisson,
And seizing the members of the Maison Gardiennage charged with transporting them as hostages, they made a series of unreasonable demands.
This incident was finally resolved by the active intervention of the Marechaussee Hunters.
The reporter who volunteered to deliver the negotiation demands, Karl Ingold, took this photo in Poisson before the situation deteriorated:
In the middle of the picture stands Eduardo Baker, leaning on his famous — or infamous — bronze pipe like a cane.
Eduardo's other hand is on his son Jakob's shoulder, who is nervously clutching the sleeve of Rene de Petrichor.
To their left is the Great Magician Parsifal, casually leaning on the railing, flashing her signature stage smile.
To Eduardo's right is the current mayor of Poisson, Renault de Petrichor. He dressed up quite formally for the occasion, though his collar is askew.
His son Rene stands in front of him, attracted by a marvel such as this new Kamera, with eyes wide and somewhat at a loss.
The woman to Parsifal's left holding an infant is Rosa Reed, with her husband Thompson, and on the far right of the picture is Tom Alter.
They are looking ahead, their faces washed pale by the Kamera's bulb. They seem to be focused not on Ingold, nor on the Kamera.

Description[]
A mediocre work of fiction telling the tale of an ordinary fellow who finds himself in another world after death.
That world is filled with dangers. Steel monsters as vast as galaxies lurk beneath the ground and devour people in the thousands.
But there also exist powerful beings who can make rooms comfortable in any season and turn night into day with a snap of their fingers. This is a story as groundless as it is meaningless.
It only shares one thing in common with the real world: most of the precious metals are owned by a handful of individuals, who keep them locked up in the vault.

Description[]
A greatsword fashioned from the spine of a great sea monster, each eerie segment of bone a tale unto itself.
In the past, seamen would use the bones of such monsters as figureheads,
And with them frighten the beasts who dwelt in the deep sea, and who envied the land-dwellers.
In the stormy oceans of the ancient past, those who put out to sea would often never be seen again.
The carefree sea shanties of today were, in years long gone, farewell songs that left people in mournful silence.
There was a greatsword-wielding captain in those days who enjoyed drinking and making merry before a voyage. When people questioned him, he laughed and said:
"I know myself. What is wine and song to me? Worry not. Once the sea and winds are right..."
But he would never finish that statement. He would only raise his mug, and call for all around to have another drink.
Then, the day when the sea and winds came together arrived at last, and the stern of the great vessel rode them as it sailed.
Deep into the misty sea it went, far across the darkening waves, into the ocean that teemed with sea creatures.
And at last, neither the singing skipper nor his ship would ever return to the harbor ringed by mountains.
After many days, the corpse of a sea monster from the deep was beached upon the shore by the waves.
Brilliant white bone shone out from a great gash torn into it by a greatsword. Its blood had long been washed clean.
"When the sea and winds are right, I will go forth to sea and avenge her, O maiden charmed by the tidal song."
"So what if I sleep with the fishes? That way, I will be able to send my sea shanties into the deep where she dwells."
Today, the seas are no longer plagued by giant creatures that emerge from the storm and rain down devastation upon the waves.
The practice of mounting skeletons of sea monsters onto the bows of ships has also been lost with their extinction.
But when one sails far abroad, sometimes one can still hear the spine-chilling sound of thunder rumbling in the depths...

Description[]
"Sincerity and diligence will surely be rewarded. That's what you always taught us, Mother."
"But those who favor sincerity are often liars, and the diligent will be exploited by others."
"Mother, it turns out you were a liar too. Why else would you be buried here?"
"And so, I must thank you. I now finally understand your true teachings..."
Before a piece of wood becomes an axe's haft, it can neither be picky about methods nor too fastidious about dignity.
Whether cumbersome formal attire or rags stained with grease and blood, all are costumes required to move upwards.
In those times — nay, perhaps even were a thousand, or ten thousand years to pass since then—
There will always be young people who grow up all too soon, who rise up in society under the banner of the so-called "survival of the fittest,"
Who will feed upon sincerity, gorge upon hope, and devour dreams, metamorphosing into a magnificent monster of the city above ground,
For whom the two cities, whether touched or untouched by sunlight, were both bountiful hunting grounds.
"Oh my. Whose daughter might you be, gentle lady, and what brings you to our Fleuve Cendre?"
As for the noble girl who had stumbled into the Fleuve Cendre, she was, naturally, quarry most worthy of being hung upon the mantlepiece...
How the fear dims her beautiful visage, like clouds choking the moon, thought the monster.
She recognized the face of a monster, but what slipped out instead was a question as to how her disguise had been discovered.
"Well, you're a terrible liar, for one. You've as much as admitted to being an outsider now, haven't you?"
"...And my dear lady, your clothes lack either soot or machine oil, nor have they ever been stained by blood..."
Yes, yes — this was a wondrous opportunity, not to be missed, he thought, as he reached out his hand to her.
The threads of spider's silk silently hanging down from the clouds above. I shall use this to enter that greatest of houses,
This ladder unto the skies, this key unto the gates of pearl.
I must not let her leave me... I must never leave her...
"Leticia, your noble soul is one I adore."
A peculiar foreboding struck him as he spoke these words, but nevertheless, he continued to speak...
All things have their portents, and that was the night before the storm,
And strangely, he was uncharacteristically nattering on about his selfish wishes:
"Leticia, have you ever imagined a world—"
"One with three times the sunshine and boundless fertile lands,"
"One where people are free as birds, free of segregation, free from deception and despoiling,"
"Where we may fly across boundless plains, or rivers and lakes, mountains and valleys,"
"Until we find a tree to call our own, roost there, and build our home,"
"With no one to disturb us, and nothing to trouble us..."
Perhaps by then, he already believed that the once ephemeral hope had now vanished like smoke,
Or had already been buried in silence and blood alongside their comrades.
"Dear Leticia, think of the children, of those newly sprouted trees,"
"Surely they should not be born amidst cannon fire, or grow up amidst the mud and filthy waters."
"Are we to nurture them with wrathful tears and hateful oaths?"
"Shall we leave them to inherit confused dreams or a mission with its outlook yet unknown?"
But no, there is no need to worry, he thought. Everything has already been arranged.
Our future... My future... It is assured.
And again, he felt a bout of that now-familiar, peculiar foreboding.
By then, he had not walked amongst nobles for some time already. When asked the reason for his betrayal,
"To be rewarded with a position higher still." "To win peace for her and the children."
He no longer remembered which was the pretext, and which was the truth.
For when a liar tells a lie ten thousand times, even they themselves may believe it.
So when his wife asked him that same question at the last, he still had not figured it out.
But he remembered the promise he had made to her. If nothing else, they two alone could keep their initial contract.

Description[]
This was in the distant past, before the prosperous port city was ever established.
Then, even the abodes of the adepti were not spared from the flaming beacons of war.
The lords once worshipped as gods fought for reasons their own,
Blood and fire, separation and betrayal. All the mortal world was stained.
Those who lost everything in the tumult fled to the mountains, and there they begged for the adepti for shelter.
Doggedly pursuing those survivors were countless monsters who had long since lost their senses.
Their names were unknown, their numbers uncountable, they came on like a flood, destroying all in their path.
The other master that they had once revered had fallen, and their fierce roaring was, in truth, a final mourning howl.
But the mortals then could not have known that the lord who once defended these mountains and waters had now passed,
And that all that stood between them and the onrushing deluge of catastrophe were a few vigilant yaksha who dwelled there.
After several days of fierce battle, white clothes had turned scarlet, and scarlet garments had been stained black. Still, the monsters came on like an endless horde...
As this tale dates to days ancient beyond memory, the tale thereafter has branched out into many versions. Some say that just as all hung in the balance,
An adeptus with azure and white feathers burst from the clouds like a descending gale,
Solitary, solemn, silent, in proud majesty and dignity did this being defend and administer the forebears,
Turning a hopeless cause around by vanquishing what had appeared a limitless tide of monstrosities...
Others say that as things appeared most perilous, two jade-carved cranes hurtled from the skies above,
And in a hail of sigils did they subjugate countless evils as a chill wind disperses an expanse of cloud.
But when all turned to look, Lo! There were no cranes, but an adeptus airborne, folding fan in fair hand...
Still others claim that so far above mortal reach was this adeptus's might that the ancestors but heard a crane's cry,
And before them, the endless monsters were as ash in an instant, like dust that dissipates in the sunlight...
No matter which version of the tale, the people of Liyue thereafter would, when speaking of the adeptus Cloud Retainer,
Would never fail choose their words with some respect. And as for what really happened back then...
"Interested in such distant matters? You truly are a person of some leisure."
"Well, what with a similar mood being upon oneself, one shall speak of it."
"Now, one believes this tale may be naught but eight or nine hours in the telling, but you should pull a chair up, still..."
"...What? Were you trying to slink away while one was distracted!?"

Description[]
People would once raise a toast to a traveler's song that was thusly sung:
"If someone plucks out your tongue, you can still sing with your eyes."
"If someone blinds you in both eyes, you can still see with your ears."
"If someone conspires to destroy tomorrow, then raise them a glass,"
"For even if tomorrow dies, this song shall live on."
They say that a region's character follows that of its archon, and that this holds true both for the people and the land itself.
But was it the unfettered archon who bestowed a love of freedom and wine upon the land and people amidst conflict?
Or was it the people who nurtured the Anemo Archon's love of freedom as they pined for it amid the howling wind and frost?
This is a question that can no longer be answered.
But that song is often sung in dark times.
Whether in the days when Decarabian reigned from his gale-crowned tower,
Or when the corrupt nobility overturned the archon's likeness,
In cloistered cellars, in dark alleys, and in decrepit taverns,
The song seeped through the gale and the iron fist of tyranny, and became an anthem for resisting heroes.
In the distant past, in a silent city ringed in from all sides,
Cheers erupted to the sound of a lyre and at last pierced the prison of raging winds.
A certain group, comprised of a youth, a spirit, an archer, a knight and a wandering flame-haired warrior,
Came and stood before the tower that loomed like a sky-piercing lance,
That cast a shadow like that of a titan,
And they swore to be free, and vowed to shatter the rule of the tower's lone tyrant.
The weak and infirm who could not scale the tower instead sang the song that, till now, had only ever been whispered in corners where the wind did not reach,
And that drinking song rose up with force enough to shake the city walls, spurring the heroes on as they climbed...
"If someone plucks out your tongue, you can still sing with your eyes."
"If someone blinds you in both eyes, you can still see with your ears."
"But if anyone dares to steal your song, the freedom you yearn for,"
"— That alone, that alone shall never do!"

Description[]
A weapon favored by the Millelith of yore.
Carved from the divine bedrock upon which Liyue Harbor was established, it is incomparably heavy.
No ordinary human could lift this blade, let alone wield it in battle.
And yet records state that the Millelith of old could use it with ease.
The Millelith was an organization first founded on the initiative of the followers of Rex Lapis.
Its history can be traced to when the port city was first completed.
Under Rex Lapis' and Liyue's banner they march, and will never desert it, whether in advance or retreat.
"While rock stays hard, the mountain shall never fail; while the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail."
The Millelith warriors adhere without fail to this code, and for it they would die without regrets.
They follow in Rex Lapis' footsteps to the best of their ability, slaying monsters, protecting the citizenry, and keeping the peace in Liyue.
The Millelith made its name not in slaughter but in defense, using their own bodies to shield their homeland.
This greatsword of unmatched weight and hardness mirrors the duty and the will of Liyue's guardians.
Xing and Han, the two members of this armed force who first carved stone into swords, must have known in their hearts,
That in the future, those who had the strength to use these stone swords would grow few.
But this also meant that the world would be at peace, and neither guardians nor swords would be needed anymore.

Description[]
In the times when kingdoms sprang up like the mushrooms and collapsed like castles in the sand, when heroes rose like stars and fell like comets,
After the Lord of Sand sank into the desert with dreams in his embrace, the blind wandering poet, of the once-privileged origin,
Traveled across the vast sea of desert, and gathered its ballads from the scattered people of the desert.
He heard of the fall of his homeland, of the prince who blinded his eyes finally crushing the overwhelmed throne.
He heard of the legends of how the dancer aided one after another in becoming the king and made them obliterated by the sandstorm.
He heard the elegy of the clear springs that were replaced by flowings sands and the ancient cries of nations that collapsed into villages and tribes.
He heard of the story depicting the homeless prince's death, the fate of his swords, and the killer that traversed deep into the forest...
Now, the ballads, uncontrollable like water yet intriguing like the flowing sand, had all been embedded in his heart.
In the searing sandstorms came forth the long-departed dream of the desert from the shards of ballads—
"On the other side of the sea of sand dunes once stood King Deshret's abode."
"The many streets and alleys were nothing less than paths of gold, converging towards the only throne."
"Like the eye that shone with a golden light and the noble heart, King Deshret was once the destination of all paths..."
"But the searing dreams of gold were broken at last, and the great eye was dazzled by the sun and the sand."
"Fate sank like the sands of the ages into the dark depths, and the kingdom of flowing sands was crushed into golden dust."
The clock of fate never ceased for half-a-second for the folly of the king and the ordinary,
The trivial nations, the despicable king, were all finally devoured by the flowing sand...
Once, the paranoid prince built up forts outside the forest line to uphold the honor of the sand.
But eventually his soldiers and people scattered, and his name was lost in the desert wind.
On top of the ruins of the pool where the regalia of past executions of offenders was excavated,
Those who had lost the dream of the desert, yet were unwilling to give up their vast sea of sand gathered.
In the name of the Reed Sea that never existed, they connected with the dream that was promised to them...

Gameplay Notes[]
The passive is indicated by a blue flame in the shape of an eagle's head that appears 5 seconds after the wielder stops taking damage. This effect is only visible when the wielder is on the field.
The 5-second timer keeps running even while the wielder is off-field.
Description[]
A mighty and noble longsword that bursts forth like a flash of light from the depths of the night.
To the end, not even once was the sword's edge marred by blood.
It is said that over the generations, many swords crafted for the noblest of knights have been based on this design.
The darkened blade blended into the nights of yore with ease,
For in those days, people feared to light fires in the nighttime.
According the songs of some bards, it was stained black during the age of the aristocracy.
Reading the tales and songs of his upright ancestors sowed seeds of rebellion in the young noble's heart.
When the time came, he forsook his venerable house, stole this sword, and hid himself in the streets.
There he roamed the dark alleys and taverns like the common folk, and put his noble swordsmanship to use by robbing the rich to give to the poor.
Under cover of night, the sword from an opulent arsenal leaped across roofs and streets in the hands of one with equally noble blood.
The blade's pristine edge remained unblemished, as did the heart of the gentleman thief who had forsaken his corrupt lineage.
But wine and song and youth would fade, and many things would happen.
In the end, when under moonlight he buried his beloved blade and fled across the sea,
He remembered that night when he had stolen it from his family's vault,
And he remembered his vow to his family, to past and present, to his land, and to his sworn brother Eberhart:[Note 1]
"Even if only by a little, I want to use my strength to turn this dark world around."

Refinement[]
Refining Dodoco Tales requires "Fragments of Innocence" instead of an identical weapon. 4 "Fragments of Innocence" can be obtained through Midsummer Island Adventure's event shop.
Description[]
Legend has it that there is a group of islands somewhere far away in the middle of a foggy sea, and this place is called the Golden Apple Archipelago.
They say that the cute and peace-loving Dodo Clan lives together on the many islands, and they have no troubles with the rest of the world.
The Dodo Clan are kind and playful creatures, and they love to tease each other and play with each other, and none of them ever get bored or sad.
"Dodoco!" they all call each other, and that means "the best of friends!"
But just as dandelion seeds will one day leave the embrace of their stalk and go with the wind, every Dodoco will one day ride the wind and the waves, and travel to the wider world on an adventure, searching for a four-leaf clover.
Why must they do this?
It's because, having lived for a long time on the Golden Apple Archipelago, the Dodocos can no longer recognize each other. They're all "Dodocos," and they all look the same, after all! So there's no "you" or "me" for them at all!
But only the red, blazing four-leaf clover can let them know the true meaning of "Dodoco" and tell each other apart, thus allowing them to play freely with all their friends!
...At least, that's what my mom says, and she can do just about aaaanything!
So, in order to understand what makes a true "Dodoco," they leave their good friends and go to faraway places to make new good friends and become their "Dodoco," too!
They'll see all kinds of nice things, hear all kinds of interesting stuff, meet lots of friends... and one day, when their friends are looking at them, at a time when no one expects it — that's when the blazing, sparkling four-leaf clover will appear!
And that's why when a furry Dodoco from the Golden Apple Archipelago tumbles into the sea or leaps into the wind before drifting far, far away, that means that a lucky child is about to meet their bestest friend ever!
This small, precious book was given by the freest mother in the world to the luckiest daughter in the world. It chronicles the countless adventures that Dodoco had before meeting her, and the adventures that she and Dodoco have had since — bigger and better adventures filled with sparks, splashes, treasures, and lots of friends!

Description[]
As Tenoch gazed upon the vast burning plains, a turbid black tide[Note 1] welled up from the horizon.
He blew his bronze horn, and raised his colossal obsidian club to his shoulder.
"The crisis emerges, yet the tribal leaders bicker endlessly."
"Let Tenoch bring his 'talking stick' over, and let it mediate the discussion."
"Tenoch belongs no longer to any tribe, yet his fury still burns, unquenched."
And thus did lonely Tenoch go forth, his colossal obsidian club resting on his shoulder,
Traversing the rugged wilds where dragons roamed, that wilderness of hot springs and lava.
The first to come forward and receive the hero Tenoch was the great runner Wanjiru and her raucous companion, Kayeke.
Her dark skin showed traces of her journey with the hero, the deep scars still visible.
Though the constant infighting among the major tribes was exhausting, Tenoch's invitation had reignited her vigor.
A ferocious battle for the burning lands of Natlan loomed — what reason did Wanjiru and her tribespeople have to refuse?
The second to step forward and embrace Tenoch was the brave Menilek and his faithful companion Ngoubou.
"Come, come! Though every tribe has chased you from their sight, though we are always at odds,"
"But in my eyes, you, club-carrying Tenoch, are a hero among heroes, a brother amongst brothers!"
The third to be found by the hero Tenoch was the cunning Sanhaj Kompore and his enigmatic companion Mahamba.
Sanhaj had been persuaded by the "talking stick" before, and the hero agreed to give him the spoils before he agreed to join the fellowship of warriors.
Kompore had foreseen his and Tenoch's heroic end, and how the place that would become known as the "Mare Jivari" in later days would be born.
"But nay, it matters little, it matters not! Perhaps there may come a day when the scoundrel made famous for being clever as a viper shall become a hero."
The fourth willingly volunteered to join the hero Tenoch. This was young Burkina and his reckless companion, Kongamato.
Burkina had never experienced the hardships of battle with Tenoch, but the imposing obsidian club guided him towards the perilous journey.
War had left countless scars upon Tenoch's body, and for Burkina, these were the proof of the path that he too must tread...
Revolution should be the fate of the young, to bleed for burning justice, rather than rotting on a comfortable bed of grass.
The fifth to be persuaded by the hero Tenoch was Sundjatta, chief of the mines, and his steady companion Muhuru.
"For the stability of all the tribes, and to avoid further conflict, I once petitioned the Pyro Archon to vote for your expulsion."
"But even today, you have yet to give up on bloody battle... It just as well, then, that this may be the final battle of our generation."
"If you are so determined to go, then I have no reason not to accompany you, but do not involve my tribe."
The sixth to go with the hero Tenoch was his greatest foe in his youth, the giant Tupac. No mount could possibly support his massive body.
When Tenoch carried his huge club to Tupac's dwelling to speak with him, he found him carefully counting the multitude of scars left on his body by challengers.
"Over 300 scars, twenty broken bones, and over 100 shards of obsidian buried deep within my flesh, like tiny jewels."
"Two hundred minor wounds, two broken ribs, and one eye that will never again perceive distance. The trophies you left me are equally generous."
The two former enemies burst into riotous laughter, and they joined hands.
And thus, Tenoch found allies from each of the six major tribes.
Glittering like the flames of roaring wildfire, they crashed into the mountains of darkness...

Trivia[]
The design of the Talking Stick is reminiscent of a macuahuitl, a Mesoamerican club with obsidian blades embedded in it.
Tenoch's name likely references the legendary Mexicah chief Tenoch, a supposed founder of Tenochtitlan, modern day Mexico City, who the city was named for.
Wanjiru's name may reference a mythical figure from Kenya. She features in Kikuyu folklore, where she is sacrificed to bring rain to her village.[1] She also features in another folktale, where she is married off to an ogre, but manages to escape before being eaten.[2]
Her companion Kayeke's name may reference a cryptid from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola. It is supposedly very similar to humans, and has its own language.[3]
Menilek's name may reference Menelik I, the legendary first emperor of Ethiopia.
His companion Ngoubou's name may reference a rhinoceros-like creature supposedly seen in Cameroon.[4]
Sanhaj Kompore's name may reference the Sanhaja people, a tribal confederation in Northern Africa. Kompore may reference Blaise Compaoré or the Kompore surname, which can be found in Burkina Faso and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.[5]
His companion Mahamba's name may reference an enormous crocodilian cryptid reportedly seen in the Congo.[6]
Burkina's name may reference the West African nation Burkina Faso.
His companion Kongamato's name may reference a flying creature from Kaonde folklore.[7]
Sundjatta's name may reference Sundiata Keita, the founder of the Mali Empire.
His companion Muhuru's name may reference a reptilian cryptid reportedly seen in Kenya.[8]
Tupac's name may reference Túpac Amaru, the last emperor of the Inca Empire.
Notes[]
↑ The Wanderer's Troupe artifact set mentions that the eponymous group, who existed during Mondstadt's Aristocracy prior to Vennessa's rebellion, which is known to have taken place about 1000 years before the start of the game, had once been in Mare Jivari, suggesting that the "turbid black tide" in the Talking Stick's description happened prior to the cataclysm.

Description[]
"Mein Fräulein, not one tear of yours was shed in vain during your pilgrimage."
Thus spoke Ozvaldo Hrafnavins when the Prinzessin's journey in the land of ever-silence came to a close.
In their long journey across space and time, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung and her Night-Severing Raven bore witness to countless stories and their endings, each a raindrop that flows at the journey's end into a bitter sea. Every young man's rage at injustice must turn to calm. Every passion must be ground into dust by the march of time, before being turned to wild paranoia upon that inverted, ancient tree. Even the branch of the tree of time upon which the great and glorious Reman Republic nested would be cut off in the end, such that the nation founded by the other twin child of the wolves might rule.
Everything in this world must pass through the doorway of their destruction unto the future kingdom of the Prinzessin. In the silence of her pitch-dark Nachtgarten would they find a place to slumber.
Even so, when Droctfult fell at the hands of the Beast of the World, having fought for the dreams of a young man and the rain that had yet to fall, and was torn to shred by its claws, the Prinzessin still began to tear up.
"Hearken well, Ozvaldo Hrafnavins. The Sovereign of the Immernachtreich weepeth not."
She went on, "Who among those born into this world are not burdened with sin? When the clock sounds for the time of judgment once more, the skirt of night shall descend once more.
Then the writhing struggles of man and beast trapped within will be naught but a midnight waltz."
"It is as you say, mein Fräulein."
"Humph. As well you should know."
"Well then, mein Fräulein, I wonder if you still recall this tale..."
Two of the three bright moons that caused the perfumed sea of the primordial universe to shine and stirred up the beasts of the Arianrhod Realm were shredded by a sword that tore the horizon asunder, left in smithereens too small even for the mystical sight of the Prinzessin.
Or perhaps this was what happened: the bright moons that once illuminated a universe, brought dreams and song to the sweet sleepers of three worlds, and awakened a deep longing in the beast-herds that wandered betwixt dawn and dusk — they were at last rendered dust. But even so, they too wished to remain within the eternal, shining gaze of the Prinzessin, bringing their subtle light unto more lands still.
Indeed. A Prinzessin does not shed tears.
That was merely a natural secretion from her royal eyes, affronted as they were by the untimely intrusion of those impudent grains of sand.

Description[]
Rumored to be a legendary polearm of Liyue.
The polearm features a dragon motif that runs from handle to tip.
It used to have a dragon-shaped wooden sheath,
but now it no longer needs to contain its might.
It shall pierce through anything that stands in its way.
It is said that when Kunwu forged this Pole, he used a dragon's spine for the haft and a dragon's claw for the tip.
Hence the weapon's body is unbreakable, while its tip is sharp beyond compare — and gleams with a dragon's malice.
There once was a dragon slayer of unimaginable strength and courage, who defied the ocean's wrath and fought fiercely against the monstrosities it harbored within.
Many years after the dragon slayer had disappeared without a trace, the hopeless sound of a dragon's cry could still be heard resounding throughout the ocean.
The dragon slayer became an urban legend. In the end, both the legend and the dragon-slaying polearm were lost.
Freed at last from the shackles of its past, it displayed the full force of its ferocity once and for all, as if to mark the dragon's return to the ocean where it belonged.

Description[]
"You wish for me to become your deity?"
The giant white snake gazed down at the child standing before him.
"It was because I could best neither Deus Auri nor Narukami that I elected to flee into waters unknown."
"If you keep seeking the light, you will experience loss in the future."
"My life is worth nothing. I've had enough of it all — of eking out this existence, of being shamed for blasphemy."
The giant serpent then showed forth a jewel that glimmered like snake-eyes.
"In that case, swear it upon this eye."
"This was also how I made a pact with my coral servants."
"Have you forgotten Master Spartacus' teachings?"
"We must never worship a god! We can only rely on ourselves!"
The white serpent said nothing, for it respected the will of the people dwelling in the depths.
If vain worship was supplanted by new belief,
Then would it not dishonor those who fought?
"I'll swear it. I'll swear it here, before this eye."
"All is as it was when I lost everything."
"The years have passed swiftly. The island is complete. The vishaps are repelled, and the Holy Soil may now be governed."
"House of Sangonomiya, gathered Jibashiri, and my vassals — the oath sworn upon the eye has come to fruition."
"From today, if two or more parties should be dissatisfied with the arrangement concerning Enkanomiya, or should you decide otherwise than you first did,"
"May the tower of the sun hear your wishes and collapse of its own accord, destroying all that was once your past."
Saying these final words,
The serpent god took the remaining people to the surface.
It was time to fulfill his oath to the heavenly city...

Description[]
A handy tool that can drill into the ground and rocks with ease.
It had a wide range of uses in prospecting and other operations.
Even stonemasons and construction workers utilized its characteristics,
To cut rocks and create preliminary shapes and structures.
Like the chainsaw once popular in the workshops and docks,
It relied on traditional and inefficient fuel to run.
At that time, when controllable Pneumousia annihilation reactions had not been developed,
The primitive clockwork meka were hindered by suboptimal kinematics and dynamics,
And were seen as nothing more than curiosities and indulgences,
While manual labor remained a necessity.
The tool's long grip was a fuel storage compartment and should be treated with care.
Even so, there were records of the drill being used in battle.
The tool's piercing and cutting power were unmatched.
Since it could pierce through even rocks like a hot knife through butter,
It made quick work out of penetrating through even softer materials.
As society advanced, this type of tool gradually ceased to be used in public.
And like some other tools, unauthorized possession of it also became prohibited by administrative order.

Description[]
Separate the dust in the flames with joy, and extract the exquisite from the crude.
For all in the universe comes from a single source, and all things may be derived from a single thought.
You must pursue that which your elder brother, the one-horned white horse, could not accomplish.
Reach the far side of philosophy, and create a new destiny for myself and your brothers...

Trivia[]
Albedo uses this blade in cutscenes throughout the Shadows Amidst Snowstorms event. In addition to matching his color scheme, the sword's description could be interpreted as a reference to his master Rhinedottir and her creations.
Cinnabar is the most common ore of the element mercury. Chinese alchemists of the Tang dynasty regarded cinnabar as one of the elements of the elixir of immortality, and more generally alchemy regarded mercury as one of the three principle substances alongside sulfur and salt, assigning it many mystical properties.
Its refinement material, Alkahest, was a "universal solvent" sought after by alchemists starting around the 15th century and said to be able to separate any other material into its pure constituents.
Known Issues[]
If Elemental Skill hits a shielded enemy without dealing damage, Spotless Heart may stop working indefinitely until the weapon is unequipped and reequipped.

Description[]
A nagamaki sword designed by one of Tatarasuna's inspectors.
It is said that the diagram is as simple and upright as that inspector was.
For a long time, before the introduction of the outlander technology that helped build the Mikage Furnace,
Tatarasuna smelted iron using the traditional "Tatara Metalworking Method."
After Mikoshi Nagamasa became the inspector, he was for a time obsessed with the grim loveliness of steel.
He thus consulted the similarly inclined Vice Armory Officer Miyazaki for advice,
With the result being this tough and simple sword, the Daitatara Nagamasa.
Although he was only the foster son of the Mikoshi Clan, and although his foster mother had stained the reputation of the Mikoshi,
And even though Mikoshi's only legitimate heir, Michihiro, abandoned him and disappeared,
His self-admitted stupidity and loyalty led him to cherish the Mikoshi name all the more.
He strove to enter the government and got rid of the family's bad reputation with his diligence and righteousness.
When his yoriki Katsuragi was connected with but a single trace of misconduct, he had him executed without mercy.
Ever since then, the name of the sword and his title were changed forever.
Lore[]
This sword was originally forged and wielded by Mikoshi Nagamasa at the Mikage Furnace in Inazuma. It was originally named the Daitatara Nagamasa, before being used to kill Katsuragi. The sword was later named "Katsuragikiri Nagamasa" (a play on words: Nagamasa who cuts Katsuragi).
More lore on the sword is shown in the 3.3 Archon Quest detailing the Wanderer's involvement at Tatarasuna.

Its diagram is obtained from a chest contained in The Arsenal.
Trivia[]
The weapon is mentioned in the Rather Aged Notes.
During the Version 3.3 trailer (at 1:12), a man can briefly be seen holding this weapon during what appears to be Wanderer's memories.
Etymology[]
In this weapon's original name, Daitatara Nagamasa, "Daitatara" (Japanese: 大たたら) means "Great Tatara", while Nagamasa (Japanese: 長正) is naturally derived from Mikoshi Nagamasa's name.
"Katsuragikiri" (Japanese: 桂木斬) means "Katsuragi-slashing." Because this sword was partially named after Nagamasa, this epithet became associated with both the sword and himself.

He gave up the vast earth, the boundless sky,
His friends in the Guild, his trusty Cool Steel, and old pals, to be with the girl he loved.

Trivia[]
The adventurer whom the description references is Herman. He can be found in-game in Mondstadt wandering near the path towards the Cathedral. If you speak to him, he will mention that he is worried because he will not have enough Mora to buy a sword as a birthday gift for his daughter, Ellin, since she wants to join the Knights of Favonius. When he retired, he forced himself to sell the sword.
If you speak to the weaponsmith Orban, he mentions that he forged this weapon for Herman. While the sword is famed, he doesn't consider it very special amongst his works, instead he wishes to make a truly legendary weapon.
Kaeya is seen wielding this sword in his official Character Demo.

Description[]
A longbow used by a noble who ruled over Mondstadt. It was crafted with premium materials and master craftsmanship. For that reason, generations later, it is still as powerful as ever.
Hunting was once a pastime of the nobles.
They demonstrated their strength in the natural world, and shared the spoils with the people in benevolence.
Unfortunately, benevolence was lost, and with it, their reign.
After the uprising, the Lawrence Clan that had long ruled Mondstadt was overthrown.
In the name of benevolent governance, the newly established Knights of Favonius deemed that protracted investigations would be unnecessary.
The Lawrence clan was promptly cast out from Mondstadt, never to return.
"On the road bound to our exile, I watched my father sigh with grief; at the betrayal of the people, at the end of a glorious era, at the final chapter of history."
"We watched the people who were once our subjects rejoicing in the open country as we bid farewell to our homeland."
"Only years later did I realize: it was we, the Lawrence clan, who had betrayed, who had ended a glorious era, and who had closed the history books. Only now was Mondstadt as it always should have been."
Vennessa was but the final push that toppled a crumbling tower.
Before her, the flames of fury already burned bright, and occasionally the flickering flames had shone through the thick smoke of secrecy:
The phantom thief praised in secret by the people. The woman who could see death. The Wanderer's Troupe intent on revolution.
The spirit of resistance is in Mondstadter's blood.

Description[]
An atlas of wind.
A copy of the atlas pertaining to the weather of the northern regions, presented in the form of poems and images.
It consists of 100,000 odes, each dedicated to a single cloud or wind and calling it by name.
The cloud atlas gave form to the winds, and odes infused them with personality.
The myriad formless winds are now friends and family in the eyes of Barbatos.
Legends tell that in ancient times, Barbatos summoned the four winds with the original version.
He thawed the snow, drove away vicious beasts, summoned rainfall, and created Mondstadt.
He permitted the atlas to be shared and copied among the people, giving it the name of Cloud Atlas.
Sadly, nothing survives the test of time. Certain drawings and odes were missing in the copies that survived.
However, the knowledge passed on in the form of ballads and legends among the general public.
The histories of the thousand winds were not lost, for Barbatos still holds them.
When Barbatos stood against the shadowy wings of the evil dragon Durin,
He sang to the thousand winds and called upon the Wind Dragon.
He who holds this atlas wields the true names of the thousand winds and all of their powers.
Now the skies above Mondstadt are calm and blue.
Barbatos and Dvalin have found a new place to call home.
The atlas, meanwhile, has been entrusted to one worthy of the honor.

Description[]
An ancient prototype pole weapon from Liyue's arsenal. The batch number has faded and no records exist to confirm the date of production.
The pole is made of black steel inlaid with gold. A lightning motif runs along the body, featuring streaks of lightning interspersed with stars. The addition of gold leaf gives it an exquisite finish.
By the time the monster threat was quelled, the remaining troops were few and far between, and each joined the civilian community where they were based. Though peace now prevailed, it sparked a martial arts renaissance that spread throughout the land.
Demand for all kinds of weaponry spiked, especially for superior quality items, and manufacturers could not keep pace. To find a solution, Yun Hui of the house of Yun met with master craftsman Han Wu and the two conducted intensive research behind closed doors.
By the time they emerged, both men's beards had grown by twelve inches. Their new weapon designs, "the prototypes," were finally ready to revolutionize weaponry manufacturing in Liyue. It was time to do away with the shackles of the past that plagued their craft.
The first pole built to the new specifications had a black-and-gold appearance. The spike at the tip was two inches longer than the previous standard. It was truly a deadly weapon, but one with a composed and commanding presence.
It was left to bask overnight in the moonlight. At the first light of dawn, the tip shone with the cold, piercing light of a star against the dim sky.
At this ethereal sight, Yun Hui's mind was flooded with memories of his father's glory, for his father's name made reference to the stars.[TN • 1] Greatly moved, he decided to dedicate the weapon to his father's memory.
For this reason the weapon became known as "Starglitter" among later practitioners of the halberd arts in Liyue.

Trivia[]
The shape of Prototype Starglitter is based on a type of Chinese polearm called Ji.
Translation Notes[]
↑ In the Chinese description, it says that Yun Hui's father's name contained the character 星 Xīng, "Star." It is unclear whether his father's given name contained one character or two, but based on the other known members of the Yun Family who all had single-character given names, it is possible that his name was Yun Xing.

Gameplay Notes[]
Press the Advantage requires the character equipped with the weapon to be on the field and also to be the one that deals the fatal blow.
Description[]
A longsword wrought from a rare kind of stone known as "blackcliff." Its sharp blade can cut through gold and jade with ease.
On a clear moonlit night a strand of dark crimson, about the length of an outstretched hand, becomes visible along the center of the blade.
Its blood-red glow faintly flickers in the dark, as if the blade is howling out into the night, announcing its desire to tear through the earth.
After designs for the new prototypes came into being, the master craftsman Han Wu overhauled his entire weapon catalog.
This particular design used a rare substance, crystallized blackcliff, to produce a superior-quality blade.
When forging a blackcliff sword, subtle differences in temperature and in the type of water used for cooling can influence the final hardness and durability of the blade.
This presents a major challenge to manufacturers of blackcliff weaponry. But it is one that the bladesmith must overcome if he is to free himself from the shackles that bind him and reach new heights of competency in his trade.
Han Wu struggled to see beyond the limits of his casting techniques. Thanks to a contact of his good friend in the house of Yun, he was able to go with a crew to the Chasm to personally procure the materials for his new weapon.
But a cave-in trapped the crew in the mine shaft for four days.
Imprisoned within the impenetrable rock walls of the cave, the crew found their mining tools to be of no use.
Deprived of all the natural light and thus of all the knowledge as to the time of day, one by one the trapped crew succumbed to the madness and despair.
Just when they thought all hope was lost, Han Wu thought he saw a faint flickering emanate from the corner of the cave, where lay the prototype sword he had brought with him into the mine.
With that sword he carved their way to freedom, and the survivors emerged from the pits of the earth into glorious bright sunlight.
but the moment that the first ray of sunlight made contact with the blade, it shattered into a million pieces.
All strength left the master craftsman's legs and he collapsed on the ground. Months later, he remade the sword and declared, "This sword shall be named the Blackcliff Longsword, for it is made of blackcliff."
All who beheld the Blackcliff Longsword were bewitched by its beauty, spellbound by its sharpness, and transfixed by its tenacity. But the crew spoke not a word of what they had witnessed during their ordeal in the mine...
Deep in the all-consuming darkness, when the master craftsman struck his blade against the cave wall with all his might, the sword released a deafening roar, like thunder sweeping across the plains. Perhaps the crew knew that the sword's cry was to foreshadow an earthquake years into the future...

Description[]
The whole world flocks to the commercial port of Liyue, much to the city's pride.
With the tides of people also come exotic treasures.
This needle-like sword, with a point but no edges, sacrifices the ability to slash for increased piercing damage.
A level of skill is required to realize its full potential.
However, it still serves as a fine sword even for those who wield it without particular skill.
A weapon from a distant shore that once hung from the waist of its seafaring bearer.
A slender and elegant blade, it stood out amidst the roughness and chaos of the sea.
When curious folk inquired, the boat captain deflected their questions. Rumors abounded concerning the blade's origins.
Some said it was won in battle against pirates, others that it was loot from a raid.
But when the red evening clouds set in and after the sails had been dropped for the night, the Chief Mate would gently polish the blade,
Reminiscing about his old life in the Wind Kingdom, the time he spent roaming as a martial nomad.
Reminiscing about a girl from his hometown, a love that ended too soon, and a promise to meet again.

Description[]
The whole world flocks to the commercial port of Liyue, much to the city's pride.
With the tides of people also come exotic treasure.
This greatsword is expertly made with the finest materials. It is unique in that the edge closest to the wielder has been left dull.
The dull edge is said to have been used as the hilt, enabling the wielder to switch forms by constantly shifting hand positions in combat.
Though it is rarely acknowledged, this greatsword was in fact a foreign bladesmith's labor of love.
The bladesmith knew himself to be dull of wits, and was anxious that this blade should not follow suit. Hence, he worked painstakingly on sharpening and balancing his beloved blade.
Sparks flew as the bladesmith worked through many sleepless nights.
The sword was recast and re-tempered countless times. All the while his mind was consumed with the hope of his lover's return, as well as his untold anxiety for her well-being.
"After the war is over..."
The bladesmith would ponder briefly, each time he paused for breath.
"Will this blade still be of use to her?"
"Will she even make it home safely?"
These thoughts would linger in his mind for but a moment before he cast them aside and refocused his full attention on the blade.
Indulging irresolvable anxieties was a futile endeavor — better to focus his faculties on creating the perfect welcome-home gift.
Finally, the day came when the triumphant expeditionary force entered the city gates, their monstrous foes defeated at last.
But the bladesmith had not had time to carve his lover's name onto the blade's body.
With no time to lose, he grabbed the sword and rushed to meet his lover on the occasion of her return.
Unfortunately, what would transpire next was to be an unbearable anticlimax.
As the warrior removed her helmet, long, soft hair flowed down. She was growing her hair out, and hence would never need to wield a blade again for the rest of her days.
Meanwhile, she had brought her lover a gift, too: A shiny new hunting bow.
"Romance is dead! I wasted all these years making you this greatsword, and now you don't even need it!"
The bladesmith was thoroughly miserable and would not stop complaining about the unfairness of it all. But his efforts had by no means been in vain — at least he had finally succeeded in making a blade of the very finest quality.

Gameplay Notes[]
Succession Seeds are visualized as small purple orbs floating above the hilt of the sword.
The duration of the Succession Seeds is shared, and obtaining a new succession seed restarts the 30s timer.
The Succession Seeds do not disappear on changing characters, so it is not needed to keep the character on field all the time to obtain the maximum effect from this passive.
You do not have to hit an enemy with the Elemental Skill to gain Succession Seeds.
Description[]
One of the "kageuchi" copies of the famed sword "Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma."
It was gifted to the Saimon Clan by Douin, the founding patriarch of the Iwakura Clan.
This gift was given in thanks for the care that he received from them when he was living in seclusion in Konda Village.
It is said that Iwakura's secret blade technique, Tengu Sweeper, can only be performed when there is not a single trace of confusion in one's heart.
In the past, the name "Tengu Sweeper" sounded the same as "Tengu Victor," and it was a sword strike that could cut a Tengu soaring in the sky down.
For centuries, the swordsmen of Iwakura, they who inherited the name "In," would use this secret blade to destroy countless evils throughout the Inazuman archipelago.
Legend has it that the Tengu Sweeper was first created in the courtyard of a small shrine where incense no longer burned.
The technique was so powerful that it destroyed the building, and Iwakura Douin's sword was broken in two.
After that, he founded the Iwakura Art with his swordsmanship skills and became the instructor of the Kujou Clan.
He would also have the Amenoma master of that time craft the sword that would be passed down through the "In" line — the "Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma."
Legends abound concerning the deeds done using that blade. It is said that its edge was so sharp that it might even cut through mortal fate.
As for the overly lengthy name, it is said that Iwakura Douin specified to Amenoma that it be called as such.

Trivia[]
Kamisato Ayaka is seen wielding this sword in some official media, such as her official Character Demo and her Collected Miscellany.
In Japanese swordsmithing, a sword is called by the name of its swordsmith. The term Amenoma therefore refers to both the swordsmith Amenoma and this sword itself.
The English and Chinese texts of the lore say that the Iwakura's sword art Tengu Sweeper sounded the same as the Tengu Victor in the past. In the Japanese version, however, they still sound exactly the same: 天狗抄 "Tengu Raid" and 天狗勝 "Tengu Victor" are both pronounced "Tengu-Shou." As a result, the Japanese text revises the sentence slightly to say that "Tengu Raid (天狗抄) is a pun on Tengu Victor (天狗勝)."
Etymology[]
See also: Amenoma Smithy § Etymology, and Iwakura Michihiro § Etymology
In Japanese swordsmithing, kageuchi (Japanese: 影打 "shadow forging") refers to a type of a spare product.[1] In some cases, a swordsmith forges two swords for one order to pursue perfection.[1] After giving the finishing touches, the smith signs their name on the one which they think is better and delivers the work to the customer.[1] The inferior one, or the kageuchi, is left unsigned and usually kept by the swordsmith themself.[1]
The name of the original of this sword, Hakuen Michimitsu (Japanese: 薄縁満光), can mean "Ephemeral Fate, Full Light." The legend that it may even slash "mortal fate" (人の縁) likely refers to the Buddhist philosophy that disregarding and breaking bonds with the Twelve Fates or "Links" (縁起), which are considered to be the twelve major laws of the world's system (and thus the origins of suffering), is said to lead the person to full enlightenment.
The name shares the theme with Ei's signature sword art Musou no Hitotachi, meaning the Slash of No Conception (Non-Thought). Such analogies between swordsmanship and Buddhism have also been historically common and were mainly developed by the swordsman-philosophers Yagyuu Munenori and Miyamoto Musashi.

Description[]
A tool often used for urban construction and ruin exploration in the past. Often used to measure angles, it also possessed a state of the art ability to measure and estimate distance. Relying on precisely crafted special arrows and the hands of trained professionals, It could keep the flight trajectory of arrows as straight as light itself.
In addition to planning and construction, it also often came in handy for exploration and even criminal investigations. In skilled hands, its distance measurements could be highly accurate. During past explorations of the ruins of Remuria, the exploration teams often brought this range gauge along, Mostly to locate the historic sites buried by time and destruction. Even the modern Hurlock novels that gained great popularity later on, Would feature it in a story about locating a secret chamber.
Presently, many range gauges are gathering dust on the shelves of antique shops or attic cellars. As more and more similar tools with greater ease-of-use and a lower skill requirement came into general use, The production of special arrows has completely ceased, and they too were soon lost and forgotten. However, as the gauge remains a longbow that can be carried around without arousing any suspicion or questioning. It has been used for several purposes beyond its original design during some certain tumultuous times.

Description[]
Page #1[]
"Sin tempted the City of Eternity to its fall, with countless slaves and usurpers thrown down in a night of wrath."
"In the name of Egeria, we swear to find the Pure Grail and restore her to her land."
"For only in this way can we atone for the sin we have borne since birth and avoid a similar death."
"No matter the sacrifice, we shall complete this noble mission in the name of the Lochknights."
The great symphony would reach its fated end, and on the ruins of a decaying world, the upholders of righteousness made their oath.
This water-blue scepter once belonged to a knight named Erinnyes who, in the time of the song of harmony, unified those of the high waters who rebelled against the gods.
Legend has it that her home was destroyed early on by the wrathful God King, with an army from the Golden City enslaving or killing her family.
Only two were to escape that fate. One met with the proud Harmost during the war and ultimately rose to inherit his authority.
The other received the grace of the Mistress of Many Waters and was taken in by the Prince of Aremorica, to guard those pure waters not yet seized by the God King.
Two people, survivors of the same home, drifting apart like duckweed on the seas of fate, one toward good, one toward evil.
And so, guided by the sea breeze and the whispers of the maiden in the lake, the noble and determined knights set out on their quest.
They faced unimaginable trials and endured sufferings never before known. But in the end, the heartfelt longing of the people reached the heavens.
Then, thanks to their pure hearts and the Pure Grail obtained through countless sacrifices, the Mistress of Many Waters was freed from imprisonment and restored...
"O Mistress of Many Waters, O gracious Egeria, I yearn for your judgment."
"I have done deeds good and great, but sinned in that doing."
"Your ideals permit no corruption. Only my expulsion can bring me peace."
"O Mistress of Many Waters, O gracious Egeria, grant me this final wish."
On a morning clear as the light reflected on the lake, the Mistress of Many Waters was moved by that pained plea.
And so the kindly goddess granted her wish and gave her blessing to the journey ahead.
For the Mistress of Many Waters knew that a fair judgment was the greatest leniency one could give a selfless soul.
And perhaps that is why that noble verdict dyed fate in its colors.
And thus did a sword as pure as lake-light sink into the lake alongside Egeria's blessings,
And the knight who had wielded that sword left, her head held high, never to be seen again.
Page #2[]
"Sin tempted the City of Eternity to its fall, with countless slaves and usurpers thrown down in a night of wrath."
"In the name of the Mother Goddess, we swear to retrieve the Pure Grail and shatter the shackles that confine her."
"For only in this way can we wash for the sin we have borne since birth away, and avoid a similar death."
"No matter the sacrifice, we must see this justice done."
The great symphony would reach its fated end, and on the ruins of a decaying world, the avengers enamored of revenge made their oath.
This water-blue scepter once belonged to a singer named Erinnyes who, in the time of the song of harmony, unified those of the high waters who rebelled against the gods.
Legend has it that her tribe was destroyed by the conquering God King, and that an army from the Golden City enslaved or slew her tribespeople.
Only two were to escape that fate. One met with the proud Harmost during the war and ultimately rose to inherit his authority.
The other hid amidst the bones and was taken in by the chieftain of Aremorica, to guard those pure waters not yet seized by the God King.
Two people who had been lulled to sleep by the same lullabies and sea breezes, found themselves now drifting apart, one on each side of the conflict.
And so, guided by the tides and the whispers of the spirit, the sword-singer of destruction set out on her quest.
She faced unimaginable trials and endured sufferings never before known. Yet, she remained unable to find that Pure Grail.
But it was the heavens who chose the Mistress of Many Waters, commanding her to return from her primeval prison to take over from the golden king and rule the sea-ruins.
"O Mistress of Many Waters, glorious primordial mother, I beg for your wisdom."
"For you, I have killed the unrighteous and toppled countless cities."
"Please tell me, this I plead, how the descendants of all seas might avoid disaster."
"O Mistress of Many Waters, glorious primordial mother, please show mercy, just this once."
In the bloodstained dusk, the Queen of All Waters was moved by that plaintive plea.
And so the kindly goddess told the supplicant what she had once told the King of Fortuna.
But the goddess did not yet know that a self-interested plea could lead only to despair.
And perhaps for that reason, the collapsing illusion thus dyed that so-called faith in its colors.
The aqua-shaded sword, long stained with blood, fell away, carrying the last thread of reason with it.
The singer who had wielded that sword stumbled from the valley, and she was never to be seen again.
The chieftain who dreamed of honor and glory did not see the land of her dreams, nor would she ever find absolution, much like the goddess who shared similar hopes.
Many years later, when the musician known as the Golden Hunter remembered this name,
Neither blood nor tears were in his thoughts. Only the sound of a distant flute, a twisting melody under a watery moon.

Description[]
An elegantly bound songbook, it was once fashionable in the days of the ruling aristocracy.
An indelible scent of daisies and finely-aged wine wafts from within its pages.
Its contents are rather absurd, but it was once a popular tune in the alleys and taverns.
"Everyone knows that drunken gentleman thief, though no one knows where he's from. One fine day — When? No one can say — he appeared like a ghost in our slum."
"He sings, he drinks, he wanders the streets, he passes the roofs and terraces by. But everyone knows he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny."
"The sword by his side was a great house's pride, and he stole it from where it'd been lain, and the bow so black that he wears on his back fires never once in vain."
"His matchless skill rings chill in the night like a comet's flashing tail, and his strides are as light as Favonius' flight, and the leaves that behold him quail."
"He could slake the entire Cider Lake, were it all filled with Death After Noon. And then he'd creep right up to those pigs at midnight, while they're all fast asleep in their rooms."
"He robs the rich and pays the poor, he blows noble farts away, he throws a spark into the dark, and night is pierced by day."
"The maidens all dream of the gentleman thief, they pine after him from their windows, but sad to say, he passes not that way, he prefers a pint with his fellows."
"Till on one day (or was it dusk?) in a mansion he ran amok, took he with him a thief's full due, and an extra silver cup."
"Left he silently in the moon's silver light, when fey were his eyes set ablaze, he lifted them nigh to a warm window bright, and upon a lovely face he gazed."
"Her eyes they shone like sapphire stones, so blue did they gleam in the dark, and the thief glanced up to the gem in his cup, and he thought them the same in his heart."
"Losing no time, the thief made his climb, and prying the gem from its place, he gave it to her, and a bashful smile stirred, and crept up upon her face."
"When at last they toppled the indolent nobles, they left, distant lands to explore, and so the song says, they warmed each other's days with light forevermore."
The story ends here. In the latter days of righteous governance, there are none left who sing of the gentleman thief, nor are such thieves needed anymore.
Wine and swords, maidens and heroes, a carefree opening and a happy ending, this vulgar sort of tale tends to be popular with the people.
For no matter how the real story went, or how the two truly ended up, wine and songs brim with hope.
They give the unfortunate a little courage to face tomorrow, and stand up to the powers that oppress them...

Description[]
A dimly fluorescent greatsword with no sharp edge.
Years ago it was known as the "Beacon of the Nether" by the mountain bandits.
Seeing it meant there was no way back.
The only way was forward, towards the end of one's life.
"Formless, like the rain that cuts through rain. Weightless, like the light that pierces light."
"Untouchable, moving like a snake. Inescapable, as sword's stare and polearm's glance."
The Rainslasher was named out of reverence for its master. Originally it had no name.
The blade's first and final master was a martial nomad who went by the name of Guhua.
It is said that he was an adeptus. While Guhua lived, bandits dared not act and the wilderness knew a peace like that of the city.
Allegedly, at the end of his journey he ascended in a purple haze and became a star.[Note 1]
One to whom Guhua had shown kindness founded what is now known as the Guhua School in his honor. But no school is destined to last forever.

↑ In the Chinese version of this line, it specifies that he ascended at Huaguang Stone Forest. Furthermore, the term purple haze (Chinese: 紫气 zǐqì, "purple cloud, purple qi") has some additional context in Chinese; it is believed to be an auspicious sign and the symbol of a person with profound wisdom and spiritual energy.

Gameplay Notes[]
The passive cannot be activated on hits that deal no DMG, even if they score a CRIT Hit.
The passive has a chance to activate for each hit that deals damage to an enemy as well as for each enemy hit while the character is on the field. Therefore:
Multi-hit skills such as Diona's Icy Paws (5 hits) are more likely to activate the passive.
Skills that deal AoE damage such as Venti's Skyward Sonnet are more likely to activate the passive if the skill hits multiple enemies.
If the character equipped with the weapon is not on the field when they deal critical damage, the passive will not activate.
In Co-Op Mode, triggering the passive generates elemental particles for all members of the team.
Description[]
A secret tome that belonged to the scholars of the Knights of Favonius. It holds the collective knowledge of the scholars.
It is inlaid with crystallized elements, which is what makes the Favonius Codex such a quality.
Not only because the elemental crystals are precious, but also because each Favonius Codex is hand-made.
Only scholars who have mastered the control of the elements can create such elemental crystals.[Note 1]
When the Knights of Favonius was founded, the Dawn Knight Ragnvindr turned the aristocrats' indoor baths into a library.
In time, countless contributions from bards, scholars and travelers turned the library into the largest collection of literature in the northern half of the continent.
After all, songs are whisked away by the wind and wine's pleasure lasts but a fleeting moment. Only that which is committed to the page may sparkle and shine for eternity.
Even so, the scale of the library's collection is now a fraction of what it was at its peak.[Note 2]
For sadly, the library once burned down in the "Great Fire of Fall Equinox" tragedy.
There is a large sturdy door made of poplar wood in the library basement.
It is said the door predates the founding of the library and stood firm against the smoke and flames.
The truth is this door stood there long before the Knights of Favonius was ever founded.
The Knights of Favonius officially states that the restricted section of the library is housed behind the door.
But tales tell of a far more profound secret hidden within.

Trivia[]
The Teyvat Script on the inside of the book reads "Zephyrus", the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Favonius.
Mona is seen wielding this catalyst in her official Character Demo.
Sucrose is seen wielding the ascended version of this catalyst in her Genius Invokation TCG Character Card.
Notes[]
↑ The translation of this sentence is a rather poor one, omitting some key words that change the sentence; the original Chinese phrase, 只有真正掌握了元素的奥妙的学者, lends closer to "Only scholars who have truly unraveled the mysteries of the elements can refine such elemental crystals."
↑ The Chinese version specifies that the current library collection is one-sixth of its original size.

Description[]
The naginata of "Umigozen," the mighty warrior of Watatsumi. Its edge flows with the phosphorescence of the depths.
The way this person once made the navies of Narukami quail are well-recorded in the island's music.
The whalesong that the twin Watatsumi shrine maidens once sang followed the tide's flow into the dreams of the island's people.
All of Watatsumi's warriors pinned their hopes and will to fight upon their shoulders.
And they brandished their nagamaki like a white, flowing wave, and with a loud shout advanced upon the other islands.
Yet the glory of Omikami and that of his warriors were dimmed by the lightning's glow...
Mouun was consumed by a dark storm of crow feathers, and the great whale who sang with the sisters sank to the bottom of the sea.
The vassal ruler, determined as a child, the vanguard of their forces, vanished into a rift rent into the very earth itself.
"Umigozen" was lost to the waves, becoming a myth to the archipelago at large.
Some say that she dove alone into the press of tengu warriors to reclaim the bodies of her comrades, and was lost after a valiant last stand.
Others say that she hid thenceforth, steering her flagship into the Dark Sea at the borders of the world...
The only proof that she once sought to change the tides of the world is this still-sharp naginata.
As long as the seas are yet disturbed by the waves, so too might the memory of her song live on.
Legend even has it that the song yet echoes within seashells and the bellies of mighty whales at the bottom of the sea.

Description[]
The full name of this weapon is the "Mighty Redhorn Stoic Stonethreshing Gilded Goldcrushing Lion Lord,"
And it was once the beloved blade of an eccentric known as the "Otogi Kongou Lion King."
...But since both names were overly verbose,
The children named the weapon the Redhorn Pestle, and its wielder the "Otogi King."
The Redhorn Pestle was a weapon made from an enchanted monster's horn,
And bake-kitsune, bake-danuki, and evil demons alike would all have to beg for mercy before its bite.
Even Reizenbou, Great Tengu of Mt. Yougou,
Feared the ominous power of the Pestle, and would not come forth to face the Lion King!
...Of course, the children never believed such tales.
Still, the Otogi King truly was very strong. Even seven men together could not push him out of a dohyou.
And when he saw children hankering after fruit they could not reach, he would kick the tree and send the melons plummeting down.
That said, he did once kick the whole tree down, and was chased into the mountains by an old man.
He also once brought the children to crash an official autumn leaf-watching concert,
Crying in a loud voice "The Otogi Kongou Lion King is here. Demons beware!"
He then wrestled with the petite oni who just happened to be in the mood for a tussle... The results were too tragic to watch.
But if this was all the King had, to the point where he was never given the right to wear the Shogun's colors,
How could he, the children said, possibly bring those youkai of song to heel?
"Hah! I was just suffering from the chills after a long night of drinking, that's all!"
Even as the Otogi King made his excuses, he did not forget to laugh heartily.
Was he just shameless, or did he really believe that he could win? No one could say...
"This time, I'll definitely cut off the horns of those monsters."
"And bring them back for ya. That'll show you the might of the Otogi Kongou Lion King!"
"Those creatures from beyond the ocean? Pfft! Easy pickings, I tell ya!"
"So yeah, shoo, shoo, follow the fox envoy to go hide in a corner and stuff."
"I'll swing by later. We'll have ourselves a few wrestling bouts then, eh?"
Even as he said that, the children remembered how the dainty oni had huffed softly,
Hurling the roaring, onrushing Otogi King into the sky...
Later, the oni who had wrestled with the Otogi King would flee after having her arm and horn cut off,
While the Great Tengu would no longer appear before humans, living in hermitage in the mountains and woods.
And so, the empty boasts behind this greatsword came true in the end,
Though the wandering, eccentric Otogi Kongou Lion King himself never returned again.
Even later on, the Lavender Melon tree that he kicked down would, with careful tending, once again bear fruit.

Trivia[]
A Fillet Blade serves as Kazuha's weapon of choice. He is shown using it in the 1.6 livestream, in his character demo, and in Collected Miscellany - "Kaedehara Kazuha: Free Spirit" | Genshin Impact; uses it to block the Musou no Hitotachi in the cutscene in the quest The Omnipresent God; and as a trial character, switches to it from the Prized Isshin Blade in the quest Ere the End, a Glance Back in Kazuha's Story Quest. In the latter, he remarks his weapon is a generic blade that he obtained while in Liyue and that he has used it for many years.
This weapon may have been chosen for him because of its resemblance to a katana, befitting his status as a wandering samurai. In addition, Kazuha does enjoy eating fish.
The Chinese version of the weapon's description contains a pun that is difficult, if not impossible, to retain in other languages:
Grilled Tiger Fish is 烤吃虎鱼 "Broiled Consuming [Chi] Tigerfish", while the dish's original name, Grilled Ticker Fish, is 烤螭虎鱼 "Broiled Hornless-Dragon [Chi] Tigerfish". 吃 chī, "eating, consuming" is a homophone of 螭 chī, "hornless dragon". The word 螭 is also used for Chi, the dragon spoken about in the World Quest The Chi of Yore, and in the Chinese name of Serpent Spine (Chinese: 螭骨剑 "Hornless-Dragon [Chi] Spine Sword").
The area of Liyue Harbor known as Chihu Rock (Chinese: 吃虎岩) was likely named after the dish.
The sword may be inspired by yútóudāo (Chinese: 鱼头刀), literally meaning "fish-head blades," a modern term given to a type of Chinese single-edged swords mainly used during the Ming period (1368–1644).

Description[]
This was an ancient time, when ships sailed alongside sea monsters.
In those days, Liyue Harbor was not at peace, not from those creatures from the deep.
They say that a great shadow once dwelt within the oceanic abyss. With great vortexes and whirlpools it would smash even the strongest of ships, and drag its prey down into the sunless depths. They also say that a divine island would emerge from the sea, rainbow-clad and fog-shrouded...
All who are fortunate enough to set foot on that island will find treasures buried for time incalculable.
Still others say that this island is a great monster in a threadbare torpor.
Most legends that pass between sailors and skippers are such bizarre ones as these. But there is one story that they all believe. They believe that Rex Lapis had once wielded a spear that pierced the rainbow, pinning the churning vortex that had once terrorized the oceans in the center of the deep sea.
Legends have it that since then, one can often see dolphins and whales congregate about that patch of ocean, singing.
Some hold that they mourn for the God that they revered, and sing many a winding dirge for it.
Others claim that they do so in awe of Rex Lapis' great power, that he could indeed pierce the rainbow's arc and bring them down the sun.
But folk legend also holds this,
That one day, the vortex, consigned to a dead stillness by the Lord of Geo's divine spear, will once again begin to wake.
When the wind once again brings the stench of the depths onshore, that will be the omen of a hurricane as large as a nine-headed hydra.
Who, then, will be able to subdue That Which Lies in the Deep?

Trivia[]
Zhongli is seen wielding this polearm in his official art, as well as in his official Character Demo and in Collected Miscellany - "Zhongli: Dominance of Earth" | Genshin Impact.
Zhongli formerly wielded this polearm as a trial character in the one-time domains Of Mysteries and Salt and Beneath the Ancient Tree, before it was switched with Staff of Homa, and switched back to Vortex Vanquisher in both instances.
Etymology[]
The Chinese name of the weapon "Lance of Rainbow Piercer" (Chinese: 贯虹之槊 Guànhóng zhī Shuò) likely refers to the Chinese idiom "a white rainbow pierces the sun" (Chinese: 白虹贯日 bái hóng guàn rì). In ancient China, such a celestial event was regarded as an omen which prophesies a lord will be pierced by an assassin.
The connotation of the idiom depends on the perspective and the context, but it can have a positive connotation in Confucianism. According to ancient Chinese historians, this celestial event was observed when the scholar-swordsman Jing Ke attempted to assassinate King Zheng of Qin (who later became the emperor Qin Shi Huang), who had been traditionally considered to be a tyrannical dictator.[1] Therefore, the idiom often refers to a Confucian philosophy that an unjust ruler will lose the Mandate of Heaven and their dynasty will be overthrown by a virtuous person.[1]
The lore in the game is a word play on the idiom in real life. As a shortend form of the above idiom, the hanzi 贯虹 (pierce-rainbow) means a "piercing rainbow" (a rainbow that pierces something). Meanwhile, 贯虹 of the in-game lore means "to pierce a rainbow" (it is Osial's rainbow that was pierced).

Description[]
Once upon the silver dunes, she danced with the three sisters of the moon.
Once as shadows reached across the land, blood and tears mingled to form a garden spring...
The Lord of Flowers was grieved, and so a sapphire city arose from her tears,
And beneath those azure domes, the Tighnarians grew proud as they spawned generations of wisdom.
People claimed that Tulaytullah, home to the Tighnarians, was the Lord of Flowers' most precious jewel.
In that golden age, even the wan face of the moon shone like warm amber.
In the gardens bloomed Padisarahs clothed in dream-like violet, while the swollen pomegranate raised their voices on high and sang...
The lattice of canals shimmered, and even the passing of deities would not see them blanketed in sandstorms.
"Xiphos, exiled high-born, my beloved..."
"Xiphos, Blade of Tulaytullah, beloved of the Jinni..."
"May the sheen of moonlight deliver unto you peace, for tonight's dance belongs to you alone,"
"And tomorrow I must depart, for the scholars have sold me unto the court of Badanah."
"I cannot forget how his forefathers destroyed my homeland and enslaved my people."
"I go now to serve the hated foe, to dance, speak honeyed words, and linger amongst them like the night wind..."
"But beloved Xiphos... On this night, the stars and lilies belong only to you."
"Keep my name in your heart, dearest Xiphos, if but only for this night."
To please the waning vassal king, the scholars who ruled Tulaytullah offered tribute,
And Makhaira, a court dancer, found herself as part of that inventory, forced to say farewell to her golden-eyed lover.
The stories that follow have been diluted by too many tongues and have been left forgotten by too many minds...
Makhaira claimed her vengeance, bringing low a desert kingdom once thought invincible...
But her own life was devoured by an adder, and she was drawn into slumber beneath quilts of gilded sand, never to wake.
Xiphos earned esteem among his kindred, yet died in vain, protecting the nobles who feared him...
The Blade of Tulaytullah met his end at the hands of another exiled princeling,
Whose banishment had been delivered unto him indeed by that serpent-hearted dancer, the daughter of a Jinni.
In the end, all people, good or evil, will find themselves ground beneath the wheels of fate,
And the sapphire city would fade, dissipating like tears beneath the scorching sun.

Description[]
The sky-piercing lyre.
The clear tunes of this lyre still echo in the hearts of the people and in the winds.
It is said that the ancient evil dragon from the abyss was enticed here by its tunes.
In ancient times, Barbatos softly strummed his lyre and summoned the pure thousand winds and songs.
Charmed by the free-spirited winds and songs, Dvalin the high dragon descended and swore loyalty to him.
Barbatos rejoiced in making a new friend, and entrusted the people of Mondstadt to Dvalin.
And so, the wandering Anemo Archon and the Wind Dragon forged Mondstadt's dawn with their relationship.
The floating tunes of the lyre halted the shadow dragon's attack in the final battle.
Granting Dvalin the chance to end the shadow dragon's poisonous reign.
Eons after the winds sang and the vicious battle ended, Dvalin awoke from his long slumber.
But gone was his master, and instead he was met by the poisonous whispers of the Abyss Order.
Unseen pain. Unheard torture.
An all-engulfing sorrow crushed the poisoned Dvalin's spirit.
Dvalin turned on what he vowed to protect,
And accursed the one to whom he had sworn loyalty:
"Indifferent is Barbatos to my pain! A careless friend is he!"
"Curse you, Barbatos, cruelest of the Archons!"
The furious friend knew not that Barbatos sought to save him.
For many fond memories may have been quashed by Dvalin's anguish, but not that of Barbatos' lyre. The Holy Lyre der Himmel.
Soon, centuries of misunderstanding shall be gone.
Soon, Dvalin shall hear once more his songs.

Gameplay Notes[]
The shield provided by The Bell's effect does not transfer over to other characters.
The damage buff provided by The Bell is active while protected by any shield.
Description[]
A strange greatsword decorated with an exquisite clock.
The distinctive sound of clockwork served as a combat rhythm for the wielder and their friends.
After the Wanderer's Troupe disbanded, the greatsword was soaked in acid. The gears have rusted because of this.
Even so, it still makes a lethal weapon.
One by the name of Kreuzlied traveled with the Wanderer's Troupe. Once a member of the ruling Lawrence clan, now a traitor and outcast.
In that time, scholars and bards paid no heed to history. For the Aristocracy preferred to remain willfully ignorant of their own moral degeneracy than face history's judgement.
But the aristocrats trembled in fear at the sound of this blade as it flew through the air, for it was the toll of the bell of judgment.
It was not made public what punishment Kreuzlied met with after the failed uprising. This in itself is a testament to his privileged origins.
Legend says that after being dismissed from office, his desire to continue the legacy of his fellow rebels led him to establish a secret society aimed at bringing down the Aristocracy.
It is also said that he gave his full assistance to the enslaved gladiator when she revolted.
In the past, a popular rumor was that Kreuzlied's secret society was working constantly in the background,
Helping the Knights of Favonius keep Mondstadt safe through deeds that no knight should ever be party to.
It was even said that the Wolf Pup Rostam ran this organization in secret, behind the Grand Master's back.

The healing effect can be triggered even if Normal/Charged Attack fails to deal DMG against an invulnerable or shielded enemy.
Description[]
A blade that thirsts after fresh blood will be awakened by its scent.
Those who possess, wield and nourish it will keep killing. Till even a pure soul is blackened by bloodshed...
There once was a bright white knight, who longed ever for the path of justice.
Clad in burnished armor, a mirror-sheen sword hung from his hip.
Wherever there was injustice, man-eating beast, or fire in the distance,
The Knight would ride up in haste to cut, slash, and pierce.
Following the teachings of the Wolf Pup, who taught him chivalry, justice and swordsmanship,
He cut, slashed and pierced them from head to toe...
Till justice had run its course, and the monster moved no more.
"I began to lose myself in cutting, slashing and piercing."
"When my blade's edge met my foe's flesh, it sent a tingle up my spine."
"Ah, I thought. That must be the feeling of justice getting its due."
"As long as I cut, slash and pierce the evil in this twisted world,"
"Someday, someday, it shall all be cleansed."
"O, foolish knight, slaughter in the name of justice is slaughter still."
"Nay. Slaughter in the name of justice is justice."
Cut. Slash. Pierce. Thus will you see justice done!
Though the white flowers the maidens offer you should be bloodied black, though your sword should no longer gleam bright,
Though your fair countenance should turn hideous, and you should be forced to don an iron mask,
Though those you defend cannot understand you, cease never!
And so, the black-stained knight persisted on his path, pursuing monsters in the name of justice,
Until he came upon an ancient, ruined realm, where he discovered the ultimate injustice...

Gameplay Notes[]
The boost to ATK is based on the base ATK of the character being buffed.
The buff is only applied when switching from the character equipping this weapon to another character.
The new character taking the field is buffed for the full duration of the effect.
Switching out and switching back in doesn't remove the effect from the buffed character.
The buff does not carry over to all switched characters during the effect window.
If a new Thrilling Tales buff is applied while a previous one is active, the buff will not stack and the duration of the buff will not be refreshed, but both of the books' passives will go on cooldown as usual.
Unequipping Thrilling Tales will immediately end the buff, re-equipping it or equipping another will reset the buff cooldown.
Description[]
Five Heroes embarked on a journey to slay the evil dragon.
For honor, the master swordsman.
For research, the knowledgeable sorceress.
For bounty, the swashbuckling mercenary.
For vengeance, the deadeye marksman.
For stories, the grand novelist.
A lotus proceeds from my mouth and flowers bloom on the page.
My words are wise and clear and my thoughts are sharp like lightning.
I joined this party because I couldn't find a job, and anybody can be a copywriter.
But I'm no writer, just a regular fellow in his mid twenties without an honest job.

Description[]
An ancient bow, as hard as cast iron, that once belonged to a famed archer.
He once slew monsters and bandits like silvergrass in the wind.
As he pursued mastery in the discipline of archery,
his string sang like unrelenting thunder,
and his arrows shone like sun-soaked iron rain.
In his twilight years, the archer had a revelation.
"The ultimate profundity of speech is the word withheld, and the ultimate profundity in archery is the arrow spared."
Thereafter, he never spoke again of arrows shot out of the sky. Nor did he speak again of the foul monsters slain by iron arrows shot from an iron bow.
He buried his bow in the ground and went to live as a hermit amidst the hills.
Allegedly, the story of his death is as follows:
Every night, as the sound of a plucked string rang out from his home, a ray of brilliant purple light shot forth, and foul monsters dared not approach.
On the night of his death there was a storm. Amidst the howling wind and rain there was but a single clap of thunder. The accompanying bolt of lightning shot upwards, towards the sky, burning bright as the stars in the galaxy.

Trivia[]
Tartaglia is seen wielding this bow in his official Character Demo and in Collected Miscellany - "Childe: Foul Legacy" | Genshin Impact.
Etymology[]
The Chinese name of the bow 弓藏/弓藏 is a part of the chengyu (idiom) "[once] the birds are annihilated, the [good] bow is put away" (Chinese: 鸟尽弓藏 niǎojìn-gōngcáng). It figuratively means an able person will lose their position once they have served their purpose. This aphorism is used as a reminder that one should not stand out too much because doing so will invite the envy of their boss and colleagues.
The archer's revelation that "the ultimate profundity in archery is the arrow spared" is most likely a reference to the phrase "to Shoot without shooting" (Chinese: 不射之射 bùshèzhīshè)[1] in Liezi, an ancient Chinese text that describes the philosophy of Taoism. The whole story of the lore may be inspired by the Japanese novel Legend of the Master written by Atsushi Nakajima (who in turn took inspiration from several episodes of Liezi), which was later made into a movie by Shanghai Animation Film Studio as To Shoot without Shooting.
